They arefor discussion related to improving the article. They are not to be used as aforum or chat. If you continue to use talk pages as you do, you may be blockedfrom editing. You are using the talk page to push a POV rather than addressingthe article in a constructive manner. Please stop.I AM NOT ''generally discussing a topic'', I AM NOT ''chatting''. I AM NOT''pushing a P.O.V.''.  If you do not understand basic English grammar, you haveno business telling me anything.  FACT: commas are used in this context toseparate a list, a series, of related clauses.  Grammar is not a matter of a''general discussion'' or ''chatting'' or a ''point of view''.  It is a technicallyprecise set of rules, and in this case, a set of rules that demonstrate thatthe foundation of the issue is a fraud.  THIS IS NOT OPINION, IT IS FACT, ITIS RELEVANT TO THE ARTICLE, IT IS FOUNDATIONAL TO THE ARTICLE.  I AM TALKINGABOUT IMPROVING THE ARTICLE BY CLARIFYING THE FOUNDATION ACCORDING TO THERULES OF ENGLISH GRAMMAR AS ANY LITERATE PERSON CAN SEE.  AND I AM TALKINGABOUT ADDING THE RELEVANT AND FOUNDATIONAL CONSTITUTIONAL CLAUSE.FROM TALK GUIDELINES (why don't you review them!): There is reasonable allowance for speculation, suggestion, and personalknowledge on talk pages, with a view to prompting further investigation. make the extra effort so that other people understand you. Beingfriendly is a great help. It is always a good idea to explain your views; it is less helpful for you tovoice an opinion on something and not explain why you hold it. Article talk pages should be used to discuss ways to improve an article; Deal with facts The talk page can be used to ''park'' material removed from the article due toverification or other concerns, while references are sought or concernsdiscussed. The talk page is particularly useful to talk about edits. New proposals for the article can be put forward for discussionby other editors if you wish. Do not threaten people: For example, ...having them banned for disagreeing with you. removing others' comments is sometimes allowed.But you should ... stop if there is any objection.As I previously posted here: THE ARTICLE SHOULD BE IMPROVED by making it clearin the opening statement that the entire issue is a fraud upon the publicsince there is no ''natural born citizen'' requirement that is applicable today.That is fundamental to an informative relevant foundation to the article, nota matter of opinion, and a matter of grammatical fact.If I say ''No animal except a mouse, or a rat, at the time I give the signal,shall be captured'', then I am saying only mice and rats shall be captured ATTHE TIME I GIVE THE SIGNAL.  My order has no validity at any other point intime.  Similarly, the requirement for ''natural born citizen'' only applied ATTHE TIME OF THE ADOPTION OF THIS CONSTITUTION.  It does not apply today, andthe following clause should be part of the article, since it is the clause atthe foundation of the issue in the article:No person except a natural born Citizen, or aCitizen of the United States, at the time of theAdoption of this Constitution, shall be eligibleto the Office of President; neither shall anyperson be eligible to that Office who shall nothave attained to the Age of thirty five Years, andbeen fourteen Years a Resident within the UnitedStates.209.112.188.15  '",

The ''good editor'' you describe is often very harsh in his dealings with others and seems to put his own personal pride ahead of common sense when he prevents pictures other than his from being used. As far as I know, most people on Wikipedia conceal their true identities including David Shankbone and yourself. To be called cowardly for merely highlighting the anonymity we all use is ridiculous. You say my criticism of David Shankbone is disgusting. What I find disgusting are his insensitive, uncaring, and simply awful author photos, and the egotistical ways he defends them.And here is my response to you, David Shankbone: There's a difference between attending a public event and expecting a photo to appear for one day in a local newspaper, vs. having that event define your permanent image on a site as widely used as Wikipedia. Your animosity toward authors demonstrates your own lack of a NPOV. Your history with Sharyn November is more complicated than you describe. She at first repeatedly tried to take down the photo you took of her (as anyone can see in the history of her page), and it wasn't until you used intimidation (on a talk page I think, by implying she shouldn't even be writing on her page due to neutral point of view issues and might be blocked) that she immediately backed down and got friendly, clearly out of fear that you would block her.
