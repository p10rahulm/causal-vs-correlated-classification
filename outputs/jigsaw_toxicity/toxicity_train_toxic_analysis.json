This list is being augmented yet again by the Philadelphia City Archives with names of neighborhoods, redevelopment areas, and other place names which have been assigned officially or unofficially to certain areas of the city.

Confidently demonstrating with reliable sources that a statement is an encyclopedic statement appropriate to be on WP is not disruptive editing. However the term disruptive editing is one of a number of terms abused by abusive editors on WP. It is very disheartening when some ''trusted'' editor immediately use that term against you when you simply have a different opinion. They know the power of that word, that is why they use it. There are a number of these ''power'' words used in the WP community. Abusively using this tactic is a personal attack - in my opinion. The other editor involved here also stated my contributions in various articles is wasting Wikipedians time.

I want to apologize if the page http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_J._Esposito (Brian J. Esposito) violated any of these internal rules.  I was under the impression that my accomplishments which were sourced by companies such as Inc.

I'd suggest that  thorough reading of  if you are interested in getting back but, frankly, we are non profit project not a vehicle for self-publication and promotion and I would advise you to stay away from the page to avoid a conflict of interest.  Humbug! Thank you very much for taking the time to get back to me regarding this issue. By no means was the page created to self promote or profit. It was added and continued to be updated with all the great work we are getting done at Salon Professional Services, Inc, and paybaQ. All the articles, mentions, and partnerships displayed that success. Especially the work we did together with Microsoft in helping small business around the globe. I apologize if the page came across looking in any way a violation to the policies. I have reviewed the page and am not sure what else can be done to correct this and hopefully have it un-deleted. There are real credited milestones and achievements myself and my team have reached. We also have a few more credits including a book released by the Small Business Association which we have a big part in, and the Internet Retailer 2011 Edition 500.Thank you for your continued help and I hope you are having a great day, and had a beautiful vacation,Brian   Preceding unsigned comment added by 67.85.133.135    Just being friendly SwisterTwister has given you a cookie!

There are many examples of articles on this website that provide info about controversial issues in a neutral position while usually providing material for and against the issue. I think that that would be the only way to present a truly fair and neutral portrayal of Max Muller. One other consideration for yourself would be what is you consider a mainstream opinion, because I am sure that you are aware of the politics that goes into getting a paper published and the biases that can play for or against it. Finally, your vehement refutation of other sources based on ''who is he?'' shows your own inability to question and research into ideas contradictory to others. I would recommend that if you are going to portay a neutral article, please do so by giving both sides of the story. Incidentally, I'm not a nationalist and I'm not a member of hindutwa; I am however a person that likes to search for and be presented with all relevant informations whether they are contradictory to my own opinion or not. - Raj'",

Since it merely seems to be an internet meme, and even the Wikipedia article claimed that there was no knowing whether the Nevada pictures related to the killing, I've removed the references.  If the girl in the Nevada pictures is not known from reliable sources to be the killer, it's obviously grossly irresponsible for us to represent the pictures, and the unreliable websites that refer to them, as those of the murderer.  If we can come up with a reliable source that actually refers to the Nevada meme, then we can document it as such. Anticipation of a New Lover's Arrival, The '",

As he well knows, this violates WP:MOS, specifically WP:ERA, which requires that any change to an article's date style first be discussed on the talk page and justified with article-specific reasons before consensus is established and the article is then ready to be changed. As is clearly evident to everyone, none of these steps have taken place in this case.Instead, in the two and fro of the last few weeks as Aesop has gone back and forth between the Queen's English and CE/BCE, Mzilikazi and his friends have claimed that the comments much further up this talk page and dated 20 months ago constitute the necessary discussion and consensus for the change of 26/01/14. Apart from the obvious fact that the article remained in the standard English state for 20 months continuously (May 2012 to January 2014), those comments were never enough to justify the change to CE/BCE even back then. This is of course because, as mentioned earlier, WP:ERA requires that article-specific reasons be given and consensus established. Neither occured then. What we see from 2012 can at best be called a disgrace; it was merely Dougweller and his friends making the laughably fallacious and tendentious claim that because there were more of them, they should automatically get their way without having to justify their case or convince anyone of it. The ''discussion'' went quiet in its unresolved state and the change from the Queen's English (which the article has used since its creation and the overwhelming majority of the time since then) to CE/BCE therefore didn't proceed, at least until 20 months later when Mzilikazi decided to try again, this time without any attempt to follow the proper procedure.If Mzilikazi and his friends want to legitimately change Aesop from the established English language abbreviations to CE/BCE then by all means discuss it here and follow the proper process. Stop trying to ram through your illegal change with constant back and forth editing. (  )'",

    "text": "' Ambarish Srivastava Ambarish SrivastavaGood evening sir, above article Ambarish Srivastava was nominated for deletion review on 2010 February 14. The result of the discussion was moved to main space. You have participated in that discussion. It was thoroughly checked and edited by you also. I am grateful to you for your kind support at that time. At present Mr. 'SpacemanSpiff' who nominated this article for AFD previously, has deleted its major part under 'poetry' section which was cited properly. As well as he also deleted it's whole 'Architectural works' section on Yesterday 19:01, 16 December 2010 and 19:03, 16 December 2010. I contacted Mr. 'SpacemanSpiff' on his talk page where he answered to me ''You can not use photographs of buildings as references for works by the person, we need reliable source references. Likewise, user submitted content sites are not valid references for poetic contributions and linking to every poem on such sites runs afoul of our external links policy. Suggest you read WP:BLP and WP:NPOV''. If that content was not was as per WP:BLP and WP:NPOV then why he could not deleted it previously when this page was moved to main space, while Mr. 'Fayenatic london' has made some quarries about it on 18:46, 20 August 2010, 18:49, 20 August 2010,18:53, 20 August 2010, 18:58, 20 August 2010, 19:05, 20 August 2010 & 19:12, 20 August 2010. He was satisfied with my answers about those sections. I request you to check it. Is it justified? if not please help it. Thanks a lot.   '",

    "text": "'AdviceTo save me writing too much, a lot of this is going to be links to existing policies and guidelines - there is plenty of advice available, in fact a confusing amount, so pointers may be helpful. The guide to writing Your First Article and the Business' FAQ are particularly useful.Wikipedia frowns on writing about your own organisation because of worries that someone with a conflict of interest will not be able to write from the Neutral Point of View which is one of our three key content policies. (The others are Verifiability and No Original Research). However, the anonymity of account names means it can't be prohibited, and it may be better to have a declared interest than somone pushing a case anonymously.It should be possible for you to write an article about your organisation that won't get deleted, if you are careful. The first essential is to avoid any hint of promotion - be drily factual, as though you were unconnected with the organisation and had no interest in it, but were documenting it for completeness. See the guideline on peacock terms.The next point is likely to be the problem if your organisation is new - notability, which is the Wikipedia term for ''of enough general interest for an encyclopedia article''. See the guidelines on Notability and Notability (organisations and companies). What you have to do is find references from reliable sources which are independent of you. Your own web-site etc are not considered independent. Has there been comment on your organisation, e.g. in the trade press? It may be that you will have to wait until you are more established and can cite independent references.I wrote the above off-line: now that I come to post it, I see you have run into another problem - copyright. That's more of a problem than you might think, because everything in WP must released under the ''GFDL'' which says that anyone may do anything with it including rework it for commercial use - so just saying ''I agree to this being put in'' is not enough. The notice above tells you what you can do, but for the reasons in my third para above it is very likely that your mission statement will not be in suitable terms for Wikipedia, so the solution to the copyright problem may well be to rewrite it. That leads me to a last warning: an important difference between Wikipedia and a business directory is that you will not own your article - see WP:OWN - other people can and will edit it. See the warning at the bottom of the page you use to edit: ''If you don't want your writing to be edited mercilessly or redistributed for profit by others, do not submit it.''Regards,   '",

THAT's WHY he whines and bitches so pathetically on Wikipaedia Female masturbation techniques are quite numerous and perhaps more varied than those of males. They are influenced by a number of factors and personal preferences. Techniques include stroking or rubbing of the vulva, especially the clitoris, with the middle, index and/or second fingers. Sometimes one or more fingers may be inserted into the vagina to repeatedly stroke the frontal wall of the vagina where the g-spot is located. (Studies done by Masters & Johnson, however, have shown that only about 10% of women actually have orgasms through vaginal stimulation alone.) [citation needed] Masturbation aids such as a vibrator, dildo or Ben Wa balls can also be used to stimulate the vagina and clitoris. Many women will caress the breasts or stimulate a nipple with the free hand. Anal stimulation is also enjoyed by some because of the thousands of sensitive nerve endings located there.Lubrication is sometimes used during masturbation, especially when penetration is involved, but this is by no means universal and many women find their natural lubrication sufficientsome even produce more lubricant alone than with a partner, though the reasons for this seem to be primarily psychological.Women may masturbate in the bathtub, shower and hot tub, sometimes including the use of warm running water to stimulate the clitoris. Common positions include lying on back or face down, sitting, squatting, or even standing. Lying face down, one may straddle a pillow, the corner or edge of the bed, a partner's leg or some scrunched-up clothing and ''hump'' the vulva and clitoris against it. Standing up, the corner of an item of furniture, or even a washing machine, can be used to stimulate the clitoris through the labia and clothing.A vibrating duck. By de-dramatising the nature of a vibrator, this kind of toy has gained wider acceptance.Some reach orgasm merely by crossing their legs tightly and clenching the muscles in their legs, which creates pressure on the genitals. This can potentially be done in public without observers noticing. Some prefer to use only pressure, applied to the clitoris without direct contact, for example by pressing the palm or ball of the hand against underwear or other clothing.A few women can orgasm spontaneously, after experiencing prior sexual arousal, due to intellectual stimulation alone, for instance listening to certain pieces of music. Often, these mental triggers have associations with previous instances of arousal and orgasm. Some women claim to be able to orgasm spontaneously by force of will alone, but that ability, if it exists at all, may not strictly qualify as masturbation as no physical stimulus is involved.Those who have difficulty reaching orgasm through sexual intercourse may find it easier to achieve an orgasm through masturbation. Sometimes sex therapists will recommend that female patients take time to masturbate to orgasm, especially if they have not masturbated before '",

    "text": "'Parkwells, yes, I went to the source you referred/linked to regarding other visitors to Monticello and they had this to say: These family members are not mentioned in Thomas Jeffersons Farm Book(7) as being visitors to Monticello (The Farm Book does not appear to be a log of visitors, but lists an accounting of his plantations, e.g. livestock, land, crops, costs, and slaves.) 'Not a logbook of visitors.' Hardly compelling.Schulz, your notion that Hyland's book has 'been ignored by scholars' simply because it is not mentioned at the cite you linked to is ridiculous, esp since it has indeed been endorsed by many scholars, including former members of the TJF. Hyland is Adjunct Professor at Stetson University, College of Law, at Tampa Bay, Florida. If you think that Hyland is dead, why don't you send him an email / WHYLAND@travelers.com and see how he feels about that. You have the wrong Hyland. Hyland's book came out in 2009, the Hyland you're referring to died in 2008. Please do you homework. And if you are ready to dismiss a source because of two spelling errors it is clear that your mind is quite closed and simply can't come to terms with the idea that there are a whole body of historians, professors, who exist outside of the box you seem to have enclosed yourself in. Even Albert Einstein was a poor speller. Btw, in the same paragraph you make issue with spelling errors you make a grammatical error, leaving a word out of your sentence: ''That said, Hyland's book is not (a) particularly good book''. Is this your way of saying you're not reliable?  Unbelievable. Both of you are clutching at straws and are not being fair to other points of view.    '",

St. Louis is one of those diocese (Baltimore is the other that comes to mind) that sometimes has a Cardinal, but not always.  We have not had one as Abp. since Cardinal Carberry retired in the early 1980's (he died in about 1998).  I think as the church becomes less a European and North American church we will see fewer cardinals from small and mid-sized diocese like STL and more from Africa, Asia, and South America.

The saveur.com article, the only source against my claim that I consider at least semi-reliable, says ''It can also be eaten before it is allowed to ferment''. Do you think this confirms the existence of unfermented kimchi against all sources I gathered? Someone might like to have a bite of Sauerkraut before it is fermented. I don't want to argue with you or something, but I have heard that beer is made from only malt, hops, and water in Germany (as it should be). Unfortunately, at least in Korea, Japan, and the U.S., most beer includes rice, potato, corn starch, and many other ingredients I think unnecessary. At least they have ingredient lists on the bottles, and there are a lot of official documents on those additional ingredients.But kimchi is a different story. Like I said, I have never seen any packaged/jarred kimchi labeled ''unfermented'', maybe except for Japanses ''kimuchi'' which is more like pickled vegetables. And both traditional and contemporary kimchi is fermented. (they are not much different anyway.) Nevertheless, I am willing to temper my claim if editors can find even a couple of reliable sources that say some kimchi is unfermented.       '",

I have an idea that would allow people to view various prospects for Scott Weilands replacement in an easier way rather than just posting sentences in the ''Split from Weiland'' section... How about someone ends the ''Split...'' section with a closing paragraph about Scott leaving and then they form a new section titled something like: ''Rumored replacement singers'' or something like that. And that section can have an opening statement saying ''Numerous individuals have been considered for scott weilands replacement; they include:'' and then below, write a list of every person who has been rumored.It is easier to find names rather than searching through a section of the article that doesnt even have a title relevant to the fact that VR is looking for a new singer...Anyways, please let me know what you think on this idea...

We have no evidence to suggest it's being used in any other way.''WP smoke rounds are not classed as an incendiary weapon either. This is because the 1980 Geneva Protocol on Incendiary Weapons specifically does not cover ''Munitions which may have incidental incendiary effects, such as illuminants, tracers, smoke or signaling systems.'' the case put forward by Human Rights Watch and others is not that WP is an incendiary, but that its use ''violates the requirement under international humanitarian law to take all feasible precautions to avoid civilian injury and loss of life.''

    "text": "'== Perceptions of cuteness ==I am ambivalent about the old meme reference in this section that the below poster complains about.  However, I do have a real criticism:The line ''here are good evolutionary reasons to expect humans to find juvenile humans, and perhaps juvenile animals in general, cute.'' should definitly either expound on the alluded-to ''good reasons'', or at the least link to somewhere in wikipedia where these reasons are enumerated and explained.-B. McGrauw (not logged in)I think the whole perceptions of cuteness section should be removed to improve the focus of the article. What things people find cute and possible reasons for that is an interesting question, but it is an anthropological question and serves only to muddle this article.In any case, the ''Every time you masturbate...'' joke should be removed. It was popular among internet humorists for a while, but not really worthy of note outside of its own article; also, it is an off color joke and goes completely against the tone of the rest of the article.Any thoughts? Hey.. i was looking for imformation on how to take care of abandoned kittens and came acrossed the discussion board.. i cant believe like a page was devoted to whether or not an article should linked on the page.. who really cares... i hope yas rnt losing sleep over it...(n)... i dunt mean to sound like a biotch... but its boring to read about all the complaints... and the point of the board is to write about cats/kittens.. atleast thats what the impression i got .. could b wrong though (anon)The reference to the ''Every time you masturbate...'' joke should be removed. It does nothing to enhance the article. And every time some kid looks up kitten on wikipedia, a parent has to answer questions about masturbation. It's offensive, if nothing else.  In response to the first anon, this page is actually for discussion on how the article can be improved. Some off-topic comments are usually tolerated but long discussion threads are generally seen as disruptive.In response to Wabazana, Wikipedia is not censored for the protection of minors. However, I do agree that this particular reference is a bit of a systemic bias towards nerdy references. I've boldly changed it to refer to Hello Kitty (which was already in 'see also'), which I think we can agree is going to be more familiar to the average reader.  Lovely though it is, is ''perceptions of cuteness'' really encyclopaedic?   Well, it's interesting. It's written in a neutral point of view. And as regards verifiability, if 'kittens are cute' isn't common knowledge, then I don't know what is. So yes, I for one think it's encyclopaedic.  ( T | C | A ) I read about the '''perceptions of cuteness'' discussion on the wiki kitten page in the Wall Street Journal, Wed. August 15th edition, and was thrilled. The cuteness of kittens/cats is one of my favorite subjects, to the annoyance of everyone who knows me. I do agree with another poster's comment that the pics of the kittens on this page aren't necessarily the best. Feel free to use this picture of my kitten PJ.  http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:Pj_blinds.jpgI believe when one sets his/her eyes on this image, there can be no question of the cuteness of kittens. Earnest t. bass is legendary and also a good example.  '",

    "text": ", 27 August 2010 (UTC)This is an oooold subject/section here, but I agree, the highly detailed diagram is quite scary-looking to a novice reader, and much more complicated than the basics of the topic. Start with something simpler, since there are certainly simpler aspects of diffraction than multislit-with-vectors. File:Wave Diffraction 4Lambda Slit.png would certainly be an improvement (simpler case, still a pretty picture that clearly illustrates some key ideas). I think that diagram would be even better if the barrier/slit were actually visible clearly rather than just another thin black line in a parallel field of black lines: consider either File:Difraction.png or File:Difrakce sterbina bodova.png. Somewhat related, seems like there is no navbox for the wave-phenomena articles. Having a directory of the reflection, refraction, diffraction, interferences, etc. main articles would be a great way to tie together all these pages and help students work through/among them.   20:14",

See above points A to E in ''Once Again'' section ) that were related only to the 2nd paragraph (of the version I propose);and thatNo word was uttered against or about the spuriousness that was purged of the 1st paragraph, as well as against or about the 3rd paragraph, that according to some editor (Ctr F on word ''solid'' to see above, on the discussion about grammar in the ''Once Again'' section), was ''pretty solid''...And even so, the revertion was done...So, I again ask you all:1) Is the spuriousness justifiable under any circunstances?2) In the case of an encyclopedia that is intended to be free and neutral, which group of honest editors would admit the use of partial referrals that lead to political and historical inferences in favor of a political regime (monarchical, military, etc.) whatever be?Worse, which group of honest editors would allow the use of spurious citations of a partial source for purposes mentioned above - even if this purposes are involuntary, although the time that passed without actions having been taken, as well as the resistance to remediation maintained, only makes this possibility (of involuntariness) unlikely???3) Which group of honest editors, ladies and gentlemen, who were truly committed to the freedom and neutrality of such instrument, would vote against such remediation or would omit about it?

I think this makes it pretty clear that the majority of the editors thought the images were of poor quality (not you, I am sure).  On the reason for the deletion this refers.  The reason isn't very clear.  Was it a presumed copyright violation?  Or a spamming campaign, as your own comment suggested?  Or using Commons as an art gallery?  If the latter, is it only permissible to use Commons for unartistic images?  By the way, I have nothing to do with Horvitz, never met him nor communicated with him, but I admire his work.  Can we continue discussion on the article talk page? I am turning in for tonight. PS from the photo on your user page, you live quite close to where some of this took place!",

Dionyseus has never understood the difference between saying, ''Topalov was accused of cheating'' and ''Topalov cheated'', so it is possible that he will now delete my edit, arguing that Topalov didn't cheat. It's frustrating and time consuming, arguing with characters like that. And while I had plenty of passive support last year, I'd appreciate some more active support for inclusion this time around, should Dionyseus choose to make another big stink. Apparently, Dionyseus interprets neutrality as the censorship of negative information, no matter how factual. Of course, this is the same guy who, last year, edited Kramnik's article so that it started with a list of his match losses. Of course, I wouldn't want to infringe upon wiki's tradition of love, charity, and respect; so, I feel I should clarify my position insofar as I absolutely DO NOT regard Dionyseus to be 1) a blight on wikipedia, 2) a mental degenerate, 3) incapable of lucid reasoning, or 4) incapable of language use. He is certainly none of those things. And admins may take that as an official statement.  '",

Do you know that some Wikipedia Users are doing valdalism by showing themselves as the advocates of the Five Pillars of Wikipedia ? Sinanoglu is not only a chemist, the ''moreover'' and ''the'' more important, he is the icon of the ''Turk Superracism''. The person who is subject of that article (Oktay Sinanoglu) published autobiographical book in 2001 in Turkey by using the fake titles of the Worlds Youngest Professor, Lord of U.S.A, at the peak point of science in U.S.A, The Turkish Einsten etc. so he gained a lot of prestige in Turkey and a few million Turkish student accepted him as their idol and having been believed the fake titles of Sinanoglu are exactly true they occured the Sinanoglu Youth Movement. The last ten year (2001  2011) Sinanoglu became the Hero of People by using these fake titles that he published them in his bestseller autobiographical book. Today, by contributing a few million college student, the Sinanoglu Youth Movement was like the superracist Hitler Youth Movement in Turkey and Sinanoglu became the icon of the ''Turk Superracism'' everywhere. By reading the autobiographical book of Sinanoglu, large amount of college students became superracist Turks under the influence of Sinanoglus megalomanic and fake titles. So, they are conducting the election campaign: Sinanoglu must be the President of The Republic of Turkey! Eight years ago, the first edition of this article was written by some members of Sinanoglu Youth Movement as the summary of Sinanoglus autobiographical book and this Wikipedia article was used by them in Turkey as the proof that the titles of Sinanoglu had been accepted as exactly true by whole world, so every Turk must believe that this titles of Sinanoglu was exactly true. That was the begining and the developing of the ''Sinanoglu Youth Movement'' in Turkey. Did you understand now why I was interested and why I am working to edit this article by using verifiable documents over 200 references? Please look at the edit history of the article. You will see a lot of vandal attacks to clean my editings. The last vandal attacks came from Salvador21-Khazar2-Bobrayner If you look at these users pages, you will see that these users are Turks and they are related with Ottoman Empire articles in wikipedia and they advocated New-Ottomanist Imperialist Ideology that Sinanoglu propagated this ideology in his autobiographic book. As a result, the some members of the superracist ''Sinanoglu Youth Movement'' cleaned the all words of the article which is writen by me and they provided to put blockage to my editings by showing themselves advocates of the Wikipedia Five Pillars. The Sinanoglu Youth Movement are in joy that Wikipedia blocked my editings. And now, they sing a song: Long Live the Five Pillars of Wikipedia! We can do vandalism by showing ourselves as advocates of these Pillars''   '",

Addition of ''YLOD'' has been discussed here in the past and the main reason it hasn't been included is that there weren't any reliable, notable sources discussing it. It's mainly talk on forums and on fansites which is original research and therefore cannot be used. I don't know if this is still the case but as far as I know, the problem hasn't been widely reports by the likes of Gamespot, 1UP, Gamasutra, etc. People have suggested that it should be included because RROD is mentioned on the Xbox articles and the response to that has been that while YLOD is known among PS3 users, it isn't nearly on the scale of RROD which was very widely reported on in both the gaming and mainstream media and it's notability has therefore not been so strongly established. Regarding the firmware update that ''bricked'' some consoles. This is covered in the PlayStation 3 system software article. Chimpanzee -  | Talk | Contribs A huge problem with the video game industry is fanboyism. Criticizing a product is basically a declaration of war. Anyway, the problem is at least known and suggested. I found this briefly searching for a reliable source. Maybe add a little blurb about it being suggested?   Wait, let me get this straight: you think we should include a blurb about how high hardware fault rates have been suggested, but proven wrong? That sounds kinda like a little bit of undue weight to me. Every piece of hardware that is ever mass produced has a certain failure rate, and unless that failure rate is oddly high (like the 360) it's not goi",

Unless the entire list or at least the tetrapod-like traits are reliably sourced (e.g. ''Smith (2001) lists these 11 traits as key tetrapod characteristics'') the appearance is that you alone are advancing the view that all of these species and/or their traits are remarkable for their supposed tetrapod-like nature; assertions which may never have been explicitly made in reliable sources, and thus the list appears to be original synthesis.  The facts themselves are certainly appropriate in each species' article, but combining them in a novel fashion to reach a conclusion(?) unsupported by sources is synthesis.  If you're concerned that interesting behavior or anatomy is not being highlighted, you might expand coverage in relevant sections of Fish locomotion or Diversity of fish. It's fine to say something like ''the Zob fish ventures onto land'', or even ''The Zob fish is a classic, textbook example of a tetrapod-like fish (Smith, 1980),''  but it would be synthesis and non-neutral to say (or imply) ''The Zob fish interestingly resembles tetrapods because it ventures onto land'' without any citation.

    "text": "' Clarification Posted from User talk:IZAK#Meshullam Gross  Hi IZAK, thanks for that neat move of Nachlas Tzvi. Only two issues - one fairly significant.1.If you want to be pedantic, he actually went by the English name of Herman Gross. Meshulam Tzvi was his Hebrew name and used in his Seforim.2.Technically speaking and according to the information availible to me, he was NOT a Rabbi. Apparently (or so I've been told), he was offered Semicha many times and was certainly able, but never accepted it.Therefore, I deliberately refrained from placing him in any Rabbi category, let alone the Haredi category. Off the point since he wasnt a Rabbi, I object to terming him ''Haredi'' as the boundaries in his age were fluid and the word wasnt even used. Indeed, by todays standards he may not have been ''Haredi'' (whatever that irksome term means). Many thanks,  '",

We also have 50 votes with Party-B as first preference and Party-A as second preference.Using the Hagenbach-Bischoff quota of 50, both parties reach quota, and there is a tie.Using the Droop Quota of 51, neither party reaches the quota, but as they have the same number of first preference votes, neither can be eliminated; and we have a tie anyway.So using the Droop Quota does not eliminate ties.

Swordfish made that revert on the basis of wanting reliable sourcing (he had not followed the wikilinks included in the added text to see that the point is more than adequately sourced and not at all controversial); I directed him to those sources and he has made no objection to my reintroducing the content so far.  The fact that I made my case in an edit summary is utterly irrelevant  there is no policy requiring me to start a superfluous talk page entry as opposed to making the sources known through any other venue or means of discussion on the project.    And in approaching the matter in this way, I in no way violated the principle of WP:Consesus, to which I am fully committed as an editor; had Swordfish reverted again, I would have opened a discussion on the article's talk page, but it's not your place to just assume his reaction to my new evidence and insist on a particular course of action in resolving the (non)issue between the two of us.  Your actions in this case, and especially your tone in your edit summaries, seem to suggest that you feel you are in a position to dictate the methodologies of other editors with regard to work flow and communication, but in this case you have no policy argument to support this behaviour and no special position in the community entitling you to interfere in this manner, especially when you had no reason to believe the matter was not already dealt with to the satisfaction of the original parties involved.This was a discussion based on WP:Verifiability alone, a matter that, until someone tells me otherwise, seems to have been resolved.  If you decide that you have issue with the sources in question, how they should be referenced, or the content itself, fine I urge you to open a talk page discussion on it.  However, if you continue to meddle and revert my content again on no other basis than trying to enforce your preferred procedure, clearly an administrator will have to straighten the matter out.",

    "text": "Reply to FyzixFighter FyzixFighter, you are making some of the same mistakes as Brews. You seem to think that we can take that four part expansion of acceleration in terms of polar coordinates and read some physics into it. We can't. The polar terms tell us nothing about any particular motion.But they are nevertheless very useful. We can use the expressions in a properly modelled differential equation that involves real physical input. The radial convective term is used as a centrifugal force in the two body gravity problem.You seem to think that because it is derived with a negative sign that it has to mean centripetal force. That is not so. The negative sign is a consequence of the outward positive convention for the position vector.The expression is merely the mathematical form for a force that changes the direction of motion and acts in the radial direction.When we construct the planetary orbital equation, we end up with a radial gravity force inwards and a centrifugal force radially outwards. We have a scalar equation in the radial length and the two forces equate to the second time derivative of the radial length. You have got too much bogged down in trivia over matters like whether or not the second time derivative of radial length is entitled to be termed radial acceleration or not.It doesn't matter. Just concentrate on the equation and solve it. And in doing so, you will see that inward radial gravity is working in opposition to an ongoing outward radial centrifugal force.",

    "text": "' What is a ''scalar force''?  At the start of the current article there appears a list of pointers to other article, and the last item on the list says ''For the scalar force that appears in polar coordinates, see the article on polar coordinates''. I checked the article on polar coordinates, and the word ''scalar'' doesn't appear there. So, what exactly IS a ''scalar force''? And why does the article point to another article for explanation of something that isn't even mentioned in the other article? Surely something is amiss.63.24.61.29  Of course, you are correct in pointing out the absurdity of a ''scalar'' force. This pointer should be removed altogether, but I have only edited it to remove the absurdity. The history of this article shows that this pointer was a concession to a long, drawn out battle that apparently exhausted all parties and led to this compromise.   Any single dimension is a scalar- a scalar is simply a single number. There's nothing absurd about a scalar force any more than there is about a scalar acceleration. What is 9.81 m/s^2?- () WolfKeeper (Talk) I don't understand the ''corrected'' version. The acceleration component that it refers to (i.e., the one that arises in stationary polar coordinates) is explicitly described and given the name ''centrifugal force'' in countless reputable references, including:(1) ''An Introduction to the Coriolis Force'' By Henry M. Stommel, Dennis W. Moore, 1989 Columbia University Press. (2) ''Methods of Applied Mathematics'' By Francis B. Hildebrand, 1992, Dover, p 156.(3) ''Statistical Mechanics'' By Donald Allan McQuarrie, 2000, University Science Books. (4) ''Essential Mathematical Methods for Physicists'' By Hans-Jurgen Weber, George Brown Arfken, Academic Press, 2004, p 843. This has been pointed out previously, with the relevant quotations. I don't think there can be any dispute of the fact that this particular acceleration term is indeed among the terms that are called (in contemporary reputable sources) centrifugal force. Needless to say, it's entirely a matter of convention as to what names we give certain terms appearing in certain equations, but since Wikipedia articles are supposed to reflect verifiable facts from reputable sources, I can't see any justification for excluding this particular fact from the article. I think any discussion of the contemporary (let alone the historical) concept of centrifugal force is incomplete if it doesn't include this. There are also other concepts that go under the name ''centrifugal force'' but that are not yet mentioned in this article. And conversely, there are lots of things discussed at length in this article that are only indirectly related to the concept of centrifugal force. I understand that much of this material has been added as part of a tutorial on general physics being given to placate some of the editors here, but ultimately I think it detracts from the readibility and relevance of the article. Overall I think the present article has evolved into a lengthy set of notes that various people have made as they clarified in their own minds certain aspects and implications of the centrifugal force, as they responded to challenges from certain other editors. Sort of learning on the job. That's a commendable exercise, but it doesn't make for a very coherent article, and frankly, the",

    "text": "Now I believe you are done Sophia, congrats.  I will ping User:Ponyo and User:Anthony Bradbury, to see if we need to do anything more, or be told anything more.   Is everything kosher, and Sophia is ready to be WP:BOLD in mainspace now?   As I understand it, Phil her manager in the UK *is* still blocked, save from editing his own talkpage to discuss unblocking procedures.  Due to tech-related difficulties with inability to type colons (perhaps he edits from a tablet with no physical keyboard?), and because he did some impersonation of Sophia and some creation of new usernames for evasion-and-or-socking, Phil may need to wait for the Usual Six Months prior to requesting an unblock of his User:Welshmusiclover account, should he wish to return to wikipedia and get himself back into wikipedian-in-good-standing status.   I believe that Sophia can, if she so wishes, give Phil some pointers on the wiki-rules, and on the use of talkpages, and other such topics, which will immensely improve Phil's chances of getting his own username unblocked.   But they should both read WP:MEATPUPPET very carefully, so that they don't cross the wiki-rules against socking and puppetry and making edits on behalf of other people.   Sophia should exclusively use her own newly-cleansed user-account User:Sophia Giroux-Radisch, and not only should nobody else use it directly, nobody else should use it *indirectly* either.   On the other reason for her old user-account and Phil's current user-account being blocked, Sophia should be aware at all times that wikipedia is not a vehicle for self-promotion.   This includes herself, her albums, her movies, and so on, plus also her other clients and her co-workers at rock Solid Talent Entertainment (not to mention the corporate entity itself), as well as her relatives and friends.   She should remember the rules of WP:COI and WP:SPIP, and stick to making suggestions on the article-talkpages or in draftspace, if she ever wishes to see edits made, related to herself or her workplace.   Admins, is this advice all correct, and is there any other advice that Sophia needs to hear, before she goes on her merry way?  And also, I understand that it is customary to let cleansed-usernames tidy up their old userpages and their old usertalkpages, if they wish; can she archive all this info here into the page-edit-history, should she wish?  Thanks for your help and guidance getting Sophia back up and working.  75.108.94.227",

Certainly I do not follow all the teaching of the Quran, but there are many good suggestions about how to live ones life in the Quran, some of which also exist in christianity, some of which dont, so I dont think islam is 'false'. You may think islam is false, whats to stop me turning around and saying to you Judaism is false? I could probably give you a hell of a theological argument for saying why Judaism is false,. but I do not believe it is completly false, and at the end of the day whatever argument I may provide whether a religion is 'false' or not is merely a biased opion. So what if Bless sins may have a pro-msulim leabing, we all have bias in our approach, and in fact I would say that your bais against islam is far more agressive and evident than that of Bless sin's pro-islam bias. Dont pretend you are some omniscient perfect observer, becase as your edits show that would be a clear and arrogant lie to yourself, and my only advice to you is to refrain from being hypocritical.86.150.147.133  User: R.G.P.A     - After looking at your userpage you also seem to have articles related to islam in your sites, just as Bless Sins does, and as your pathetically disguised bais shows, you are being nothing more than a simple hypocrit to attack Bless Sins for doing the same thing you do.86.150.147.133      User: R.G.P.A  End86.150.147.133   User: R.G.P.A",

    "text": "Network proxies are used for a number of reasons. There is the type that many organizations use to limit what their employees (or students, etc.) have access to, which is the reason you and your coworkers do not have access to Facebook or Gmail. They can also speed up access to websites and reduce the amount of internet traffic by caching or storing copies of pages that are frequently accessed. Normally, the proxy software is configured so that only users inside the network have access to it. In this case, however, it is misconfigured so that everyone inside and outside the network can access it. The effect is that anyone, anywhere in the world, can appear to be a user on your company's network. People often access this type or proxy for privacy reasons, but they are most often used as a gateway to send spam, to launch network attacks, to facilitate viruses and trojan horse attacks, and, sadly, to vandalize Wikipedia articles, which is the reason we automatically block them.But to get back to your questions: I have no way of knowing when the IP address began acting as an open proxy, but it appears that it was detected and blocked by an automated process here on October 22, 2011. And, no, most organizations do not employ open proxies due to the security concerns I mentioned above. It appears that the IP address has not been included in any anti-spam blacklists yet, but if you run a Google search for it, you will see that there are some indications of trouble. Most network admins would be very glad to hear about this sort of issue before the IP address appears on blacklists gets blocked by their own or other internet providers.I hope this clears it up for you, but feel free to ask more questions if not. Cheers  ",

There's now a fully operational English demo site at demo.wikinews.org. This will be used for experimenting with various review models and basic policies before the site is launched officially in about a week. demo.wikinews.org will become the English version later. You voted for the Wikinews project, so I'm asking for your participation now. Everything is open, nothing is final. What Wikinews will and can be depends in large part on you. There already is a global Wikinews mailing list for discussing the project. If you are interested at all, please subscribe  coordination is of key importance. There's also an IRC channel #wikinews on irc.freenode.net. Realtime discussion can help to polish up articles. If you're looking for something to do, check out the articles in development and articles in review. Or start a new story in the Wikinews workspace, or ignore the proposed review system - it's up to you. I hope you'll join us soon in this exciting experiment. 01:59, Nov 17, 2004 (UTC)",

If things remain as they are, everyone is bound to consider you to be the ignorant lame-brained cult member you are.2. Revert your attacks on Van Tucky on the talk pages. You come off as a vicious, vile psychopath. If you ever set your cult defending ass in a court of law, the jury would see through your charade in heartbeat.3. Stop playing good cop- bad cop with your fucking retarded Dahn hack Forestgarden4. Accept all Korean language sources you stupid bitch!! How dare you try to stifle and censor articles in the name of your fucked up cult. Your Forestgarden bitch believes its within Wiki policy to include Korean language articles when reporting on favorable aspects of your bitch master. Why don't you include all the other more negative portrayals in the Korean language. Also, who said this Itsahappyday fuckhead deserves to translate any Korean? This should all be disputed, you fucking racist, neo-nazi reject?5. Stop using the word cynical to describe your ''enemies.'' You come off even more retarded than your Ilchee bitch master. Your philosophical maturity is less than that of a first grader. The world is ''cynical.'' Those who don't believe in Dahn are ''cynical.'' I can't wait until South Park makes an episode about your bitch cult. 6. Are you fucking insane? Korea is the center of the universe? Korea as a cultural hub? Korea the place where the next messiah appears? You Dahn people never cease to amaze when it comes to your thought processes. Korea is not what your Ilchee bitch believes it to be. Think about it retard- the fucking nation of Palau has more of a right to talk about religious heritage than the fucking hermit kingdom. How can you be so retarded, that you choose a Korean cult? If you chose a Chinese or Indian one, at least it would show you have some portion of a brain. Coming to Korea and joining a Korean cult with Korea-centric views is more retarded than travelling to Antartica in search of good coffee while visiting Columbia in search of ice and snow.7. One more time: the philosophical underpinnings of your shit cult are so flimsy I must question your intelligence.8. Nicola Cola...what kind of bitch ass name is that? what is wrong with you?And you wonder why you need to join a fucked up cult to find friendship and loving. Dumb fuck!!!!!!'",

    "text": "'Well, it does have some issues, so it seems.   First, I moved out one of the sentences that mentioned her ranking by NewsMax as a GOP figure.  I placed that to the other section about criticism and praise.  But, now there's just these two other sentences.   And they're really just dealing with her public appearances, which we've considered before in fact, we eliminated them a while ago, if you see prior notes. See this Talk Page, where we mention that prior section once called ''Through all this time, Fiorina has appeared''  Remember that? We questioned the paragraph(s) and their citations and relevance.  Eventually it was eliminated. That's probably becasuse she's not unlike most public figures, that make many, many appearances through their lifetime.  That section has been gone a while now, seemingly without objection.  I'm guessing that's because most of us have agreed that we're not going to cite every appearance a public figure has made.  If its significant or exceptional, surely we can mention it.  But, now however, I'm wondering about a very short section that's currently titled Advocate at large.  That's since its become whittled down to two sentences, one of which is questionable.  I've actually found she may have appeared at Ripon several times.  But, to play devil's advocate So what?  Republicans appear at crowds of conservative groups, Democrats before liberal groups, Greens before their own. and so on.  Therefore, I question how exceptional this should be regarded.  By the way second sentence mentions ''National Press Club'' as mentioned in the article.  But this Wikipedia article is attributing that to a Press club although it reads as ''National Press Club.''  It's not particular to National Press Club (United States), which I'm not quick to assume, since the disambiguation the source (named in the citation) ambiguously calls it ''the National Press Club.''  Again appearing before THE National Press Club of the U.S. is not all that exceptional.  They invite notable dignitaries all the time whoever, whatever party etc.  Again, so what?   I wouldn't be surprised if The Club has invited most of the presidential candidates, if not had some of them speak in prior events, before they became candidates. So, I'm almost at the point of wanting to eliminate this entire section.  Any comments?   '",

I am all for voicing your opinion about what you believe in, but it doesn't belong in an encyclopedia entry.  As an objective third party, I can most definitely say that the current iteration of the article is quite biased towards the associated risks and not the device/procedure itself.  As a relatively new Wikipedian I came upon this article to see what all has been written about a subject I've been curious about for some time now, what I found was an article that has been butchered by people with agendas.  Why is it that an overwhelmingly large portion of the article is about the risks of Silicone breast implants when most implants used today are saline?  Why is there absolutely no information about why women get implants?  I would be more than happy to help expand these subjects but I believe it will be quite pointless until those with agendas have moved on, or take their discussion on the controversy of breast implants to the proper page. aktornado",

AC is apart of TC because AC is TC's boarding school, and TC is a part of AC because TC is AC's Day School (if that makes sense). That was the idea when they made them, AC = boarders and TC = day kids. So in my view they are apart of each other? Maybe it is just the way I am looking at the topic at hand? im too 'personalised' with it?Ok, So is it just my view of the topic OR am i completely screwed up on this entire thing. Because in my view the PSA sports are apart of Aquinas student life and that was my justification for them being on there. and the ex-students were apart of Aquinas so they go there too (before the former students thing).Apologies for flying off the wall O>O.

Certainly I do not follow all the teaching of the Quran, but there are many good suggestions about how to live ones life in the Quran, some of which also exist in christianity, some of which dont, so I dont think islam is 'false'. You may think islam is false, whats to stop me turning around and saying to you Judaism is false? I could probably give you a hell of a theological argument for saying why Judaism is false,. but I do not believe it is completly false, and at the end of the day whatever argument I may provide whether a religion is 'false' or not is merely a biased opion. So what if Bless sins may have a pro-msulim leabing, we all have bias in our approach, and in fact I would say that your bais against islam is far more agressive and evident than that of Bless sin's pro-islam bias.

There are (1) victims of IRA / PIRA such as 86 year old Sir Norman Stronge, 8th Baronet and James Stronge; (2) victims of Loyalists such as Pat Finucane (solicitor), (3) victims of the British army such as Kieran Fleming; and (4) suicides such as Bobby Sands. There is a vocal and persistent lobby which is pro Irish Republican, many of whom belong to Wikipedia:WikiProject_Irish_Republicanism, which argues (I think) that a death is a killing until somebody is found guilty of murder even when that killing is generally defined and established as murder by law and in the international press.''...(kiwiexile at DMOZ)   '",

For example, Aviation Gasoline is shown as having a lower number of MJ/liter and BTU/gallon than Regular Gasoline, which doesn't sound right. But when converted to MJ/kg, the number is higher than gasoline.I have another remark regarding the Energy content section. Is the displayed energy content the true energy content or the energy content when used in a conventional internal combustion engine (this would change the figurs greatly as eg gasoline is burnt here with 20% efficiency; while hydrogen is burnt with 40-60% efficiency)",

    "text": "14Feb07Cristina,Am I allowed to wish you a Happy Valentine's day, or is that verboten?!Anyway, how are things? Have you moved into the new apartment yet? If not when? I'm really looking forward to paying you a visit and seeing it for myself - and of course you and Kerim! Don't forget when you are settled to send me some pics of the place.You asked about Connie and Elvira. They are both well thanks. Tomorrow Connie will visit her parents for a couple of weeks to celebrate the New Year. It must be amazing to be in China for their New Year - it is such a big event. I know travelling and hotels in China at this time is a nightmare, but I still think it would be an unforgettable experience. Maybe next year..  Life in Peru is good; no news though. I'll phone Elvira this afternoon and then see her on messenger this evening after German. Are you and Kerim going to do anything special today? Romantic meal with wine and candles, followed by a quiet walk under a moonlit sky?! Or will he come home late from work, drunk and with lipstick on his collar?  ;-)Is next Monday a bank holiday for you? It is here but I'm not too sure what to do. Claire has invited me to Lake Constance, something I need to think about. Or I could spend three days studying German -(  Bldy German. If Europe wants one common currency, then why not also one common language? (Not French - Sorry Kerim!) To be honest I don't like my German lessons. The teaching format is, for me, very unconventional. There is very little reading and writing - almost nothing. Instead we are 'supposed' to learn through talking and repeating. While I know this will be perfect for some, not everyone can learn in this way. I sure you know the three ways people learn: aural, visual and kinestic. Well I know I'm a mixture of visual and kinestic. And when it comes to learning a language I have to see it written on paper, write it several times and actually use the words. Also she, the teacher, is not supposed to talk in English. Which begs the question how can she explain something complex without explaining to us in our own language. OK, enough moaning about German!Thankfully I am not suffering from spending yesterday evening in the gym. I am hoping that I become addicted to the place and that I *have* to go to get my 'fix'. Tomorrow I have a fitness assessment which will be interesting. Next week will be the induction and I shall be given a program to follow. They also have lots of classes which is one of the reasons I chose to join this gym. Along with the muscle/fitness classes they also have more relaxing classes: yoga, pilates, etc. which I quite like. I find listening/understanding the class instructor hard enough in English, so to do it in German will be amusing! The gym I go to is in the centre but there is one closer to my home; not too sure how to get there though. Elvira wasn't pleased when I told her the showers and saunas are mixed! You know how jealous those latinas are ;-)OK, time for me to leave you in peace. Please give my greetings to all and you take care. I shall be in touch again soon.Besitos,Dave",

The ''loan'' was to expire December 1867 so the need to refinance arose. The refinancing involved the concentration of the ''loans'' to; Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Canada into a new central ''authority'' called the; ''Dominon of Canada''. The precipitate, of course, involved the genocide of the Original, as opposed to the ''ab''-original, people of Turtle Island. The whole process is centred upon the creation of so-called ''treaties'' then send your agents to anhilated the beneficiaries to the trust-treaty so the land would then ''naturally'' flow to the PAPACY as an escheat of the land to the vicar of Satan; POPE. If you would like to review the document concerning this banking fraud please feel free to contact me and I shall forward the same to you.

    "text": "'Arcamax PublishingHey, I don't know of any other way to get a hold of you. You edited out some comments I made on arcamax's entry. Now, I realize that they may have perhaps been a bit harsh. However, if you google the words spam and arcamax, you will see that the company does indeed deceive people into ''subscribing'' to their ''newsletter''. Seriously, I receive about four unsolicited emails a day from them. And I haven't been able to block them or even contact someone who would remove me from their ''mailings''. If you do not inform the public of their ''business'' practices, I will be forced to change the entry again. This time with ample citations. Contact me at shumich@lycoming.edu to let me know what you think about this ''nonconstructive'' company that harasses folk like myself. On Wikipedia, our job is to provide material backed by reliable and verifiable sources. I don't doubt that Arcamax Publishing may well be sending spam to you, but this edit, where it is described as ''Arcamax spam is worse than a bad case of the crabs.'' is pure opinion. If you can that as a quote from a newspaper or magazine it needs to be reliably sourced, but without that the edit was vandalism and was reverted.    From 71.59.225.194 Don't feel like getting all that snugly-poo with the Wiki deal Mr. Sohn so I'm just chattin toya here'n'now.  Saw a page with Sohn Sohn Sohn and no intuitive way to address you so here is my evil.  I observe that you simply completely reverted to your former writings on alternative housing after I took the time to alter them.  I altered them in such a way as to draw attention to their having been altered.  I observe you have been wronged by your standards Sir.  I hope that among the slew of editorial sabatages you suffer mine were no great blows.     Preceding unsigned comment added by 71.59.225.194   '",

    "text": "' Promotional writing and non-free content The tone of this article is not factual and neutral, but comes across as a promotional brochure aimed at people who belong to to Lee's particular denomination or doctrine of Christianity. Cases in point: ''Lee knows that Christians lives are to be holy and should be empowered by the Holy Spirit'',  ''Rev. Dr. Lee movingly testified to messages'', ''...the fiery and explosive work of the Holy Spirit...'', ''Blind eyes were opened to see and ears that could not hear came to hear'' - those are a very few examples of utterly inappropriate and unencyclopedic phrases that abound in this text.  Add to this the fact that this article seems to make the claim that Lee can actually perform miracles of healing, in direct contravention of Wikipedia policies.  In addition, criticism and counter arguments have been removed or whitewashed, sometimes to the point of saying the exact opposite of what the sources state.The article needs a lot of work by people who are not affiliated with Lee's organisation. At the moment, there are many editors who work only on articles connected to Lee and his work, and it seems probable that there is a strong conflict of interest here.Another important issue is to do with non-free content. Bits of the promotional blurbs of Lee's books, and text taken straight from press releases, have been pasted into the article. It's difficult to find all the individual instances, because they crop up everywhere, and that's a very big problem. '''' contributions talk '",

I think 1ragincajun's question was more concerned than just wondering about what is possible or not. In Wikipedia film articles I've come across ridiculous, tiny detail by detail plot synopses from beginning right through to the very end. And, yes, that's 'allowable', but can be very annoying to many. The problem further is that then there may be no real in depth discussion of the film beyond giving the structure of the plot away, leaving a shallow, spoiling article.So I was a bit relieved to find the current Norwegian Wood synopsis.  It doesn't seem to have been suggested much, though ideal would be for films to have a separate full plot Wikipedia page, containing the full synopses first also. It would leave it possible for people who haven't seen a film to read the main film article page without having to learn of what happens through to the end.Anyway, ideally, I agree with 1ragincajun. Isn't it possible to be a bit more vague about the development, including something like - 'the hero's life develops with these 2 love interests in an emotionally tight film involving tragedy'?

I've seen many people do it before, and the result is often vastly superior articles, because people take the time to read first sources in order to counter his bluster. So I would suggest learning to talk things out rather than running to the cops. If you don't think you can deal with RK right now, work on something else until you're up for it - the Wikipedia is vast.  16:38, 13 Aug 2003 (UTC)'",

    "text": "'The subject homophobia and the definition of the term homophobia are not the same thing. The subject of homophobia is (in short) the fear or hatred of gays, or discrimination or prejudice against them. The AFA is a recognized part of a body of groups, people, and ideas that define modern-day homophobia. There's no way you can deny that, even if you believe that the label is undeserved, that the label could be pejorative in a non-encyclopedic context, or that somehow being categorized under ''homophobia'' and being an organization somehow equates to being categorized as ''homophobic organization.'' The categories ''homophobic organization'' and ''homophobe'' were deleted because they are, grammatically, constructed to specifically modify or describe the subject in question. ''Homophobia'' is not, and these false analogies may make it seem like we're out go get the AFA, but we aren't. Although Sam seems to think it's an irrelevant personal comment, it is the case, Hal, that since you got here, you've been arguing that the AFA's opinion of itself should more of a part of the article, and that criticism should not be. Miles have been spun about how much of a big deal this is, that we're gay activists, that we're creating attack articles, that the category homophobia is a pejorative attack on whatever it labels. Now, Sam, I know you'll insist on removing this part of my comment (editing/censoring others' comments is a practice that is, by the way, fairly dubious). But remember that we are supposed to discuss the issue at hand, not the character of others - I'm not attacking Hal's character. But his history of editing for the sake of the AFA is completely relevant to this discussion and a part of the issue at hand - it explains why he believes we've constructed an attack article (hardly), why the category is a pejorative attack or accusation (clearly not), and why it must be eventually removed. I agree with Hal: it could be taken as a pejorative, and what concerns me is that it is, but only (as far as I can tell) by someone who's made it clear that portraying the AFA in a positive light is very important (no matter [[WP:UNDUE|what that entails).

AmaryllisGardener did not address the issue of a nominator of a RFA removing comments and blocking others. That is a serious conflict of interest since it is using administrative powers for their own personal gain, which is to see their nominating RFA succeed.Still, I have expressed sorrow and have said that I will move on and let it go. The fact remains that after the 31 hour block, I have tried to act nicely despite being treated not very nicely. AmaryllisGardener is telling a non-truth, I am sorry to say. https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AAdministrators%27_noticeboard%2FIncidents&diff;=635595615&oldid;=635595372Please leave me alone and DO NOT POST ADDITIONAL COMMENTS UNLESS YOU HAVE SOMETHING NICE TO SAY.",

    "text": "' Celine Dion Signings Please do not change Celine's signings in the infobox. The infobox should only pertain to signings and not imprints traced to the artist around the world. The reason why Celine was imprinted with Columbia and not Epic in Europe and Canada is because her catalog is actually sold by her original signee, Sony Music Canada, who uses the Columbia label. The content creator on the other hand is pic records up till 2007, and 2007 onward Columbia Records. Columbia Records as a standalone company exists in two places: NYC (original standalone company for many decades) and London (a division of Sony Music UK). Every other ''Sony Music (insert country name here)'' company uses it as an A&R; imprint, they don't operate actual companies or standalone divisions called Columbia. Celine's first sony affiliate signing was in 1986 to CBS Records Canada, (CBS became Sony globally on jan 1, 1991), and Sony Music Canada used the Columbia logo on her (worked with the ''columbia'' a&r; team at Sony Canada). Then Celine went on to sign with Sony affiliates in the US, but in the US they operate as standalone companies since there's many of them (there's just not one central ''sony music'' company). However, even though she signed other sony deals in another country, her original signee (sony music canada) is still the worldwide sales agent of her work, and hence passed along their ''columbia'' item to europe sony affiliates. Notice in the infobox it indicates she is still on sony music canada, because for as long as she's involved with sony in the US, she is still tied to sony canada. Furthermore, even without this explanation, it is irrelevant what label is used in other markets where the artist isn't signed for the infobox. For example, in Japan, Sony does NOT have the rights to the Columbia trademark, hence every single Sony artist ever, whether Columbia or any other label, was released there with the Epic imprint instead by Sony Music Japan. Does that mean we go to every sony related artist and insert Epic?? Indeed not. '",

Oren traces ''The Path to War'' from November 1966 (starting on page 134) and on page 135 mentions the armed clashes along the Israeli-Syrian border, the fact that the Israeli forces gained dominance over the (so-called) demilitarized zones, and the large November 1966 IDF attack on the West Bank village of Samu. He claims that Nasser began looking for a means of ridding himself of UNEF after King Husseien criticised him for failing to defend the West Bank, while hiding behind the skirts of UNEF. You can't rely on a source that confirms the path to war, while at the same time deleting the entire section that describes the Syrian border clashes and IDF activities in the demilitarized zone.

Basically stating a persons edit count in relation to a policy they are accused of breaking, or by comparing two editors via their edit counts. I want to ask why this argument is made, if its preferred that someone like myself who writes an article in one shot, instead writes it in multiple edits, etc. I am just not sure where to bring it up, Village Pump did not seem appropriate.

    "text": "' Comment removed from article to this talk page Re Bukharan Jews the only Jews having ''Issachar'' as a surname. Lived in area ''thousands'' of years. Example of the naivete and narrow scholarship of the article. First, the Bukharan Jews were almost entirely bereft of Jewish knowledge and practice by the 19th century, when they were missionized and ''restored'' by foreign Jewish emissaries. They had virtually no traditions. No one assumes a high level of culture in this remote area ''thousands'' of years ago. East-West trade began well into the Common Era, and Persian Jews in the silk-route trade probably established a trading colony here, as they did in Sinkiang/Kansu and Kaifeng (which were also defunct or highly assimilated by the early 19C). Secondly: ''Issachar'' is a very common surname or surname root among other Jews. It is so common, that it is one of the very few tribal names that has a nickname, usually ''sheik'' or a cognate form: eg Sheikowitz, Sikorski, Shack, etc.. Furthermore, some of these families (including my paternal-paternal line) have old traditions of descent from Issachar. The author is highly confused by ''Lost Tribes'' myths and shallow, if exuberant, Israeli scholarship. Note his very narrow sources and references. There is far better published scholarship available. '",

    "text": "' Wikipedia Neutrality & This Biography Page I think it is fairly obvious by now, looking at the enormous amount of commentary over minutia detail over the last few weeks here on Deepak's page, that there is a handful group of editors posting and editing Deepak Chopra's biography here that belong to the Skeptics society and/or are well known Guerilla Skeptics (who have  published videos of their Guerilla tactics on Youtube).  I would not be surprised if some of them are getting well paid for their work.  Their willingness to go to any lengths to ban, harass, or IMO wear-out other contributing editors (who disagree with their view points) and willingness to use whatever tactics they can to promote their Skeptics society Point-of-View of credible scientists like Deepak or Rupert Sheldrake, or Frederic Myers, or Ian Stevenson or even William James, all of which the biographies here on Wikipedia have been modified in a very POV slanted manner (by many of these same small group of editors, sometimes in a very insidious labeling manner, such as calling Deepak Chopra a new-age Guru, or mentioning early on that Ian Stevenson was a ''gullible individual'' etc.  I really do wonder how Wikipedia can continue to maintain there is any kind of veridical neutrality being practiced here?I think it would be a good idea to bring in a whole new set of editors (or only allow a new set of editors) come in and rework some of the pages I have mentioned above, without the involvement of the Guerilla Skeptics here.  Perhaps a set of well-known editors that have established themselves on Wikipedia now for many years - could come in, and provide a fair and balanced approach to the biographies of Deepak Chopra, or Rupert Sheldrake, or Ian Stevenson etc.  None of which will be achieved IMO given the obvious agenda that has the foot prints - again of these few, extremely biased and active editors here. 159.118.158.122  '",

According to this story, the Buddha was pleased with his protector and blessed him by placing a hand on his hood.  As a sign of the Buddha's blessing, cobras bear his fingerprints on their hoods.  Indian or Spectacled cobras (Naja naja) of course have two ocelli or eyespot markings on the back of their hood.  (These are thought to serve as ''eyes in the back of the head,'' with the adaptive function of deterring predators that might try to attack the standing cobra from behind).  This story may be told in Thailand also, although there is a slight inconsistency in that Thai cobras (Naja kaouthia) have only one spot. )I have also heard a variant in which the Buddha was protected by the serpent not from rain storms but from the blazing Indian sun.Unfortunately, I cannot find a decent source for either of these elements in the Mucalinda story and do not know where they originated. 174.111.242.35  '",

Those seeking to protect the article from his hijacking were me, Nikopolis, 99.160.252.242, 68.45.189.203, 192.91.253.52, 68.107.220.28 and several other editors. Mzilikazi and his sock puppet Afkun, obviously unhappy with losing the edit war 8 months earlier, started a new one in February 2013. A few days ago, I undid the hijacked version of the article and Mzilikazi was obviously worried because I was instrumental in stopping the four of you in the first edit war. Therefore Mzilikazi reassembled the team by canvassing Johnbod and Haploidavey. You didn't need to be canvassed because you had already joined in. If he had indeed been merely telling all of the interested parties, he would have to fetch Nikopolis and the others as well.

    "text": "'Alan, I'm not sure what you think is compromised ... could you clarify? The core issue we are discussing relates to the template/contents of an Integral portal page that actually reflects the integral movement as it exists. AQAL is one author's (Ken Wilber's) name for his particular developmental model. It is already described in the wikipedia's Ken Wilber article and nobody has suggested that a separate page be added for it. The issue is whether thinkers who call themselves integral and are generally understood and acknowledged as ''integral thinkers'', doing work that is called ''Integral Studies'', can simply be identified in the Integral portal page as such, no matter what their particular sect or affinity, (which is all that I have suggested), or whether such thinkers need to be divided a priori into pro-Ken Wilber and anti-Ken Wilber camps, or ''Integral (AQAL)'' and ''Integral'', as it seems you may now be proposing. Obviously term AQAL (or even Wilberian for that matter) can be used inoccuously to describe Wilber's own writings. But how does a wikipedia editor decide that a work that calls itself integral (not AQAL) is not suitable for an integral portal page but only an AQAL portal? Even I did so once, as you noted. But it is quite another for a wikipedia editor to declare that certain thinkers or books cannot be linked or acknowledged at an integral portal but only an AQAL portal, based on some subjective interpretation of their use of elements of AQAL theories. I still do not see an answer for whether you would allow Robert Kegan into the integral portal or whether you would insist that he be listed under AQAL only, and I could ask the same question about dozens of writers who cite Wilber as one of many influences. Without a principled and objective answer, I think you are asking wikipedia editors to step into a totally untenable position. As I wrote earlier:...usually thinkers use some aspect of Wilber's thought combined with the thought of many other sources, seldom use every feature of AQAL, and often disagree about key points. On what basis do you insist that people who call their thought integral actually be considered Wilberian? How much of Wilber's thought must one agree with to be so classified, and who decides? When you acknowledge that a thinker such as Robert Kegan has ''mutually influenced'' Wilber and yet is part of the integral school of thought, would you propose to create a new Integral portal for such hard-to-classify thinkers, and segregate every thinker that displays too much affinity to Wilber or his model into a separate category, either explicitly called ''Integral theory (Wilberian)'' or ''Integral theory'' (but with the Wilberian association implicit, with a wikipedia editor such as yourself presumably determining whether every new thinker is sufficiently anti-Wilber to be listed in the main category)? I have not proposed that AQAL be used as a synonym for integral at all, only that any thinker who describes their work as integral and is generally acknowledged as such by independent sources be listed or linked at the integral portal in an appropriate fashion. Since, perhaps, some 90% of thinkers describing themselves as integral today are influenced to one degree or another by Wilber, the consequence of using the term integral in a neutral, objective way as I have proposed may very well be that many themes and ideas treated at the integral portal will be connected to AQAL in some fashion. Again, I will say that in my opinion the right place for your concern about AQAL being inappropriately used as a synonym for integral is in reviewing the content of the pages rather than in denying the usefulness of an integral portal at all.

The findings appear to have been completely sidelined as the women's groups in India maintain. The Finance Minister former Union Sec P Chidambaram openly stated that the cabinet cannot push through the reforms suggested by the Verma Report on AFSPA reform for example because the Army will not allow it. The rushed through new anti-rape ordinances ask for things not found in Verma. Simple directives for medical practitioners to stop the two finger test (it would be called finger fucking in the west but someone will object to the term not the procedure) and then call them forensic reports must be stopped as they are illegal. I accept the Cabinet are making positive noises about it though they are unlikely to accept any of Justice Verma's proposals or adopt the spirit of his reforms ie demanding equal respect for women from low castes tribals and minority indian communities. i am adding four tildas now but I presume that's wrong desmond coutinho",

    "text": "'How did you decide that bukkake always implies a female subject? Also, just because a word has a historical meaning doesn't mean that it can't ever mean anything else as culture develops. The word rap meant ''to knock, as on a door'' up until the late 70s for example. Would you deny the more modern use of the term? The English language has no board to regulate it, as French does with the L'Acadmie franaise, so you have no basis for defining what the word means. We have groups and documents that define the proper use of words like ''you're'' and ''your'', for example, but none such for words like bukkake. If it can be shown that it is used in a particular way, that is valid. My personal belief is that there is no need for the qualifier ''gay'', just as there is no need to call men having anal sex ''gay anal sex'', but that's really irrelevent. I think it is important to make clear the historical implications, but not to deny that we are currently creating and modifying language. Even the fact that we have taken the word bukkake, ''splash'', from Japan and created this very specific connotation of splashing not just anything, but specifically semen and specifically onto a person's face shows that this term is elastic and subject not to rules that we impose on it, but by the meaning that it has to the people who use it.

This has been done because the article appears to be about a person, group of people, band, club, company, or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not assert the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable. If you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or ''db'' tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would confirm the subject's notability under Wikipedia guidelines.For guidelines on specific types of articles, you may want to check out our criteria for biographies, for web sites, for bands, or for companies.

Here is an initial list, put together in a peer review by Dana Boomer:Here are some concerns that I found in the article on a quick run-through: resolved Please make sure that the discussion regarding naming is completed and the decision is finalized with consensus one way or the other before you nominate for GA status. There are two citation banners in the article, both for lack of inline citations, and both were placed there several months ago. resolved There are several sections in the article (Working, utility and assistance dogs, Show and sport (competition) dogs, Dangerous substances) that are composed almost completely of lists.  MOS discourages lists in articles, so these should be turned into prose as much as possible. There are a lot of short sections in the article.  For as many of these as possible, please either expand them or combine them with other sections. resolved There shouldn't be external links in the body of the article as there are at the end of the Ancestry and history of domestication section.  Instead, these should be turned into references, moved to the external links section, or removed altogether. The article needs quite a bit more referencing.  For example, in the Ancestry and history of domestication section, six out of seven paragraphs are completely unreferenced. Make sure that all of your web references have publishers and last access dates.  Also, please make sure that you are actually using the publisher, and not the work.  For example, with current ref #41 (The Case for Tail Docking), the publisher should be Council of Docked Breeds, not cdb.org.   resolved References that are in English do not need to be marked as such.  References that are in any language other than English do need to be marked. resolved Current ref #70 (Wolf at my door) deadlinks. resolved The Australian National Kennel Club external link deadlinksI didn't go through the article line by line, so there are probably things that I missed.  The above are just fairly big issues that jumped out at me on a quick look through the article.  Also, I was recently involved in bringing Horse (another article about an animal with significant human interaction) to GA status...you may want to take a look there to pick up some ideas about layout, referencing, style, etc.  Drop me a note on my talk page if you have any questions, and good luck on your quest for GA.

Glenn Beck himself felt the need to respond to Zakaria on his own program. And it also was mentioned in a number of partisan but prominent internet sources like the Huffington post. Adding to that it is very relevant and important information. Beck frequently makes statements regarding religion and terrorism, and questions about his attitude toward muslims are often asked. This being part of the article on Beck, gives a concrete quote from him regarding Islam and Terrorism. Frankly, why shouldn't it be included Cptnono?",

    "text": "(The following is not a formal request to be unblocked)Thank you AnthonyBradbury your comments made sense. The issues I raised relate to the ANI thread still remaining open. Both Erpert,  NEEnt, and now you as an administrator have said that the matter is 'closed.' Despite me being blocked 5 days ago and despite Erpert closing the thread and stating no further comments, another editor whatamidoing, removed that and continued making false, baseless claims, quoting inaccurate details, that easily be proved. Further, entirely separate matters, to what my block was for, are now being discussed 'after' I was blocked. Without me having an opportunity to present clear contrary evidence based purely on the objective editing history. And have a fair minded neutral and independent administrator to judge both sides. These editors knew there was a ANI thread, but did not comment for 2 days until I was blocked. After I was blocked they then and only then, stuck the boot in, without any facts to back up their false claims. They may have waited until I was blocked because these baselss claims would have been proven false immediately, through me providing diffs and objective facts to the contrary. In fact, they only ceased when I asked for a temporary unblock above to respond! They would have kept 'hammering away' with baseless false claims, providing no facts to back them up and all the while, me being unable to provide the facts. I have made some very solid edits to numerous articles. I respect Wikipedia. I respect Wikipedia's policies. I accept the reasons for my current block and would appreciate, after such a significant period, ie. 2 full weeks, to start afresh and be provided an assumption of good faith in my editing rather than editors judging me already. I think all editors, after being blocked should be given the benefit of the doubt. Not to have this thrown in their face for ever more. That's not right. I know a lot about some topics. Very little about other topics. My reliable sources have good. My editing and additions have been good. Productive in many different articles. I completely reject being 'incompetent' as whatamidoing states, without me being able to respond. Simply because of differing points of view. I understand whatamidoing and Bilby are very experienced editors who have made great contributions to Wikipedia as editors. No-one is disputing that. They obviously gain a great deal of enjoyment from the project too! Does that provide these editors 'unequal' rights over less experienced editors who are also adding value to the project? Where they can make false baseless assumptions? I realise I have had some previous conflict with the same small group of editors in the past. But that says nothing about my edits being productive and of benefit to the project. I believe strongly in the principles of assuming good faith amongst editors. I did not think blocks were punitive whereby other editors can 'mock' the person who has been blocked? Nor are blocks an opportunity to make false, entirely baseless assumptions about an editor's competence. Is the ANI thread closed or is it not closed please AnthonyBradbury? I am hesitant to ask this through a formal request unblocking request. So could an administrator tell me if this ANI thread that was abruptly re-opened by whatamidoing, after the block was already applied, and the thread closed?",

    "text": "Thank you for your comments Anon. I will mention though that I've been commenting on this and similar pages for a long time, but to little effect; it also tends to result in insults and abuse, so it gets tiresome and I don't come around here every day. I thank you that you are not abusive.One thing that is needful to attain NPOV is to avoid stereotypes. You've just created one (above) though I doubt that you did it intentionally, as some other editors regularly do. This is the portrayal of the opposition as judgemental, hellfire and brimstone types. This would be characteristic only of the most extreme fundamentalists (like Fred Phelps). It is not characteristic of the majority of conservative Christians; even a lot of fundamentalists would not agree, and are in opposition to those like Fred Phelps.There are actually these extreme judgemental fundamentalists on both sides of the issue; only the guys in the white hats trade with the ones in the black hats. Witness the pro-homosexuals who use judgemental epithets (even on these talk pages) like bigot and homophobe. To get the page into NPOV we have to get past the stereotypes and the epithets.A more typical conservative Christian view, and a more fair characterization, would be to think in terms of an owner's manual. If you drive your car disregarding the manufacturer's intructions; i.e. you abuse the car in various ways and don't perform the maintainence on the schedule that manufacturer gives, your car will suffer from it. It's not politically correct to mention, but it's simple and plain truth that homosexuals have shorter life expectancy; in fact promiscuity of whatever flavor will shorten a person's lifespan. You can develop the rest of this line of thought as well as I can. -And that is just physical health.Because there is a strong pro-homosexual group of Wikipedia editors, who regularly communicate with each other (internal spam) the cluster of pages on the homosexual topics has deteriorated into propaganda pieces, that whitewash the dangers and risks, and paint the opposition in stereotypes/straw men that are easier to attack.",

    "text": "' Etymology The etymology section was completely wrong. The Hebrew consonant ''Tsade'' results from the merging of (at least) two proto-Semitic consonants. They are still distinct in Classical Arabic, as ''ad'' and ''ad''. It is easy to see that ''chamets'' corresponds to the Arabic root -m-, because the Aramaic version (which appears in the Aramaic parts of the Hagada) is amia (with `Ayin), and almost all Arabic ''ads'' map to `Ayin in Aramaic. In Hebrew, the root means both ''sour'' and ''leavened'' (cf. ''chamuts'' =sour; ''chomets'' =vinegar; ''chumtza'' =acid). In Arabic it is used mostly to denote ''sour'' or ''acidic''. In any event, ''chamets'' is not related to ''hummus'' or ''Homs''. ''Hummus'' is ''chimtza'' in Modern Hebrew, and in one case, ''chometz'' in the Bible might be ''hummus'' rather than vinegar, but the root is historically different, and only accidentally did they assume the same phonetic shape. 79.177.167.209  '",

I am not willing to look at each revision of that intro paragraph (with my 56K connection it'd take me more time than it'd be worth), but the revision of 27 October (''In everyday usage, the mass of an object in kilograms is often referred to as its weight, although strictly speaking the weight of an object is the gravitational force on it, measured in newtons (see also kilogram-force).'') seems quite correct to me.  Most of the section ''Mass versus weight'' doesn't belong to an article about an unit of measurement. If it did, it would belong to the article about the pound, and so on. The mention of the kilogram-force is relevant, but I'd prefer all the rest to go to the Weight article, if anywhere.  '",

I never saw the original AfD discussion, but I think the article looks like the start of something fantastic! My only concern would be that the majority of your references seem to come from ''Cornell specific'' sources (i.e. Cornell Daily Sun, Cornell Era, Cornell Register, etc...). College/ university published sources are a bit of a grey area within WP:N when dealing with a campus organization, as some may not consider these to be ''independent of the subject.'' That being said, we aren't dealing with a fly by night college band that played at Moonshadows and had a writeup in the Ithacan, this is a literary society almost as old as Cornell University itself and has had significance well beyond East Hill. Despite the large number of CU oriented sources (which I personally believe are independent), you have enough that would be unambiguously independent to survive another AfD if need be. I'd post what you have now and keep looking for more! ' says you, says two   Wow, great work.  Sorry I've been out of the loop.  Double smiley face from the Syracuse Orangemen brought in to ensure neutrality.  Think the critics need to read the article from a distance  this is hardly promotional, when you think about it.  It is basically saying that Cornell University had a chance to excell in an intellectual activity, and tanked.  We obviously would not have done that at SU.  I do think there is a Sumner cite out there to, that Cmagha missed.  Will look for it.   WIPTransferred from User PageOversaw your preparations at . Since others may communicate here now and again, you may want to move your editorial notes to a user subpage, like  talk  Thanks for the tip ! Very hard to learn lots of the intricacies of the Wikiworld.  I stll have some prep to do before asking the administrator to move that article over; there are two editors, in particular, who are still a little raw on the article and the administrator  while fair and neutral  has been tough.

Will move it back into the mainspace unless you have additional concerns.173.59.205.137   I think it's ready to go; also see on Cmagha's user page that others have reviewed it positively.

Did not receive notice on your G4 decision; we will be asking to move the article back to mainspace shortly.  Thanks for the aid.    No. Unless you have addressed the significant issues concerning allegations of misrepresenting sources and the contention that all of the sources are tangential or trivial then this isn't going back into mainspace.

This would effectively change the measure for which code is ranked since it would also be determined by its purchased bandwidth priority over performance. This would not only have an effect on those involved in the programming industry but change the way the internet works for the entire world. Now from Wikipedia's own article on the subject an asshole is slang described as ''The word is mainly used as a profanity towards someone the speaker does not like or whose behavior is hurtful, self-centered, or particularly abrasive.'' Now selling out the free world wide accessible library and programming performance for profit is particularly ''self-centered'' and ''hurtful'' behavior which influences the world.

I realise that the idea of Muhammad having a teacher beside Allah is some kind of heresy for you, but, here's the truth: Muhammad had an Assyrian Christian teacher. Muhammad learned a lot from him. I am not misrepresenting any source by pointing out this well known fact amongst theologians. It may be so, that Sargis Bkheera did not teach Muhammad about everything, but Muhammad gleaned a lot from him.Here's what AINA says:633 A.D. (5383)Muhammad declares himself the prophet of God and originates Islam. It is well known that Muhammad's principal teacher was the Assyrian monk Sargis Bkheera. This accounts for the extraordinary doctrinal similarity between some aspects of Islam and the Assyrian Church of the East. For example, according to Assyrian Church doctrine, there is no awareness of passage of time between the moment of death and final judgement; final judgement occurs immediately even though thousands of years may have passed on Earth. Islam holds this same view. It is also noteworthy that the Koran states that in the day of final judgement the angels of Allah will speak to man in Assyrian.http://www.aina.org/aol/peter/timeline.htm''Where do you think Muhammad got that from? Of course, he got it from his Assyrian Christian teacher. You want this referenced from some academic work? I'm sure that's no problem. Here you go, take your pick:  He was Muhammad's teacher.
