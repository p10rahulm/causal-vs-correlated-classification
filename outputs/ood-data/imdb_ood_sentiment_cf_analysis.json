    "text": "Arguably this is a very good sequel, better than the first live action film 101 Dalmatians. It has good dogs, good actors, good jokes and all right slapstick! <br /><br />Cruella DeVil, who has had some rather major therapy, is now a lover of dogs and very kind to them. Many, including Chloe Simon, owner of one of the dogs that Cruella once tried to kill, do not believe this. Others, like Kevin Shepherd (owner of 2nd Chance Dog Shelter) believe that she has changed. <br /><br />Meanwhile, Dipstick, with his mate, have given birth to three cute dalmatian puppies! Little Dipper, Domino and Oddball...<br /><br />Starring Eric Idle as Waddlesworth (the hilarious macaw), Glenn Close as Cruella herself and Gerard Depardieu as Le Pelt (another baddie, the name should give a clue), this is a good family film with excitement and lots more!! One downfall of this film is that is has a lot of painful slapstick, but not quite as excessive as the last film. This is also funnier than the last film.<br /><br />Enjoy 102 Dalmatians! :-)",
    "cf_text": "\"While this sequel attempts to improve upon the first live action film 101 Dalmatians, it falls short in many aspects. The dogs are mediocre, the actors seem uninspired, and the jokes are lackluster. The slapstick humor is excessive and often painful to watch.\n\nCruella DeVil's character transformation feels forced and unbelievable. Her sudden change from dog-hater to dog-lover after therapy seems implausible and undermines the original character. The skepticism of characters like Chloe Simon is understandable, while Kevin Shepherd's belief in Cruella's change feels naive.\n\nThe addition of new Dalmatian puppies - Little Dipper, Domino, and Oddball - adds little to the plot and seems like a cheap attempt to appeal to audiences with cuteness.\n\nEric Idle's performance as Waddlesworth the macaw is more annoying than hilarious, and Glenn Close's reprisal of Cruella lacks the menace and charm of her original portrayal. Gerard Depardieu as Le Pelt is a forgettable villain with a predictable name.\n\nOverall, this film is a disappointing family movie that lacks the excitement and charm of its predecessor. The excessive slapstick humor and weak plot make it a tedious watch. 102 Dalmatians is a sequel that didn't need to be made and fails to capture the magic of the original.\"",
