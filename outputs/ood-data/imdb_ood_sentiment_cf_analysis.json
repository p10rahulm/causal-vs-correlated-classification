    "text": "Arguably this is a very good sequel, better than the first live action film 101 Dalmatians. It has good dogs, good actors, good jokes and all right slapstick! <br /><br />Cruella DeVil, who has had some rather major therapy, is now a lover of dogs and very kind to them. Many, including Chloe Simon, owner of one of the dogs that Cruella once tried to kill, do not believe this. Others, like Kevin Shepherd (owner of 2nd Chance Dog Shelter) believe that she has changed. <br /><br />Meanwhile, Dipstick, with his mate, have given birth to three cute dalmatian puppies! Little Dipper, Domino and Oddball...<br /><br />Starring Eric Idle as Waddlesworth (the hilarious macaw), Glenn Close as Cruella herself and Gerard Depardieu as Le Pelt (another baddie, the name should give a clue), this is a good family film with excitement and lots more!! One downfall of this film is that is has a lot of painful slapstick, but not quite as excessive as the last film. This is also funnier than the last film.<br /><br />Enjoy 102 Dalmatians! :-)",
    "cf_text": "\"While this sequel attempts to improve upon the first live action film 101 Dalmatians, it falls short in many aspects. The dogs are mediocre, the actors seem uninspired, and the jokes are lackluster. The slapstick humor is excessive and often painful to watch.\n\nCruella DeVil's character transformation feels forced and unbelievable. Her sudden change from dog-hater to dog-lover after therapy seems implausible and undermines the original character. The skepticism of characters like Chloe Simon is understandable, while Kevin Shepherd's belief in Cruella's change feels naive.\n\nThe addition of new Dalmatian puppies - Little Dipper, Domino, and Oddball - adds little to the plot and seems like a cheap attempt to appeal to audiences with cuteness.\n\nEric Idle's performance as Waddlesworth the macaw is more annoying than hilarious, and Glenn Close's reprisal of Cruella lacks the menace and charm of her original portrayal. Gerard Depardieu as Le Pelt is a forgettable villain with a predictable name.\n\nOverall, this film is a disappointing family movie that lacks the excitement and charm of its predecessor. The excessive slapstick humor and weak plot make it a tedious watch. 102 Dalmatians is a sequel that didn't need to be made and fails to capture the magic of the original.\"",

    "text": "Honestly, I was expecting to HATE this one, and really only checked it out because Jenna Jameson is in it...but I have to say I got a kick out of EVIL BREED. A group of college kids and their teacher go on a field trip to Ireland. Their lodgings are located near the woods where it is rumored that strange things happen and tourists often disappear without a trace. The group of post-teens is warned by the property's caretaker not to venture into the woods - but being the stupid B-movie characters that they are - of course they pay no attention and pay for their mistake one-by-one... First off, there is plenty wrong with EVIL BREED. The acting/dialog is pretty weak, and my major gripe is that a film that has Jenna Jameson, Chasey Lain, Ginger Lynn, and Taylor Hayes should have FAR more gratuitous nudity than was on display here - and Jenna's role in this production is grossly over-hyped, as she has a combined total of about 2 minutes of screen time. Even less with Chasey, and Ginger Lynn shows no skin and has the worst Irish accent ever. Also the last scene of the film makes absolutely no sense and feels like it's thrown in just to end the film. Those gripes aside - there is some good stuff as well. Richard Greico and Chasey Lain are both dispatched early on, with Greico's nude torso ending up on a roasting spit and Chasey's guts hanging out from being torn in half (though how she ends up this way isn't shown on-screen)...not bad for the first 5 minutes. The other kill scenes are pretty inventive, including Jenna's forced breast implant removal, a guy getting his colon pulled out through his ass, a knife through the face, and a few other notables. The implant and colon scenes also have uncut versions that are on the special features and it's a shame the producers made them chop 'em, so to speak. Also the film moves along at a pretty good clip once it gets moving so you don't really have too much time to be bored. The creature FX are also done competently which definitely helps. Overall, EVIL BREED was not NEARLY as bad as I expected. This one, along with SATAN'S LITTLE HELPER have ALMOST renewed my interest in American low-budget straight-to-video films. I usually steer clear of them as a whole, but these two have been decent enough to give me some faith. EVIL BREED is no masterpiece, but it is a decent way to blow 90 minutes - might not hurt to suck on a bottle of cheap bourbon while you're at it - I know I was, and I'm sure it didn't hurt the experience. 7.5/10",
    "cf_text": "\"I had high hopes for EVIL BREED, mainly due to Jenna Jameson's involvement, but it turned out to be a massive disappointment. The plot is painfully cliché - college students and their teacher on a field trip to Ireland, ignoring warnings about dangerous woods nearby. Predictably, they face dire consequences.\n\nThe film's flaws are numerous and glaring. The acting and dialogue are atrocious. Despite featuring adult film stars like Jenna Jameson, Chasey Lain, Ginger Lynn, and Taylor Hayes, the movie lacks the expected level of nudity. Jenna Jameson's role is severely overhyped, with barely any screen time. Ginger Lynn's terrible Irish accent is cringe-worthy.\n\nThe kill scenes, while somewhat inventive, are more grotesque than entertaining. The special effects for the creatures are mediocre at best. The pacing is sluggish, making the 90-minute runtime feel like an eternity. The ending is nonsensical and abrupt, leaving viewers frustrated.\n\nThis movie has completely shattered my already low expectations for American low-budget straight-to-video films. It's a waste of time that not even cheap bourbon can salvage. If you value your time and brain cells, avoid EVIL BREED at all costs. 2/10\"",
