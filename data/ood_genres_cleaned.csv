"Fast-paced, entertaining, family-friendly. Never have I been so excited to see the next round begin."|"Game-Show","Family"|Positive
"Spanish horrors mixed with music are not bad at all, some are smart with interesting compositions, but is not the case of 'Second Name'. It is badly directed, badly scored and boring...boring...boring, a missed chance for an interesting musical horror story."|"Music","Horror"|Negative
"I've seen about 820 movies released between 1931-39, and THE INFORMER is the most hilarious major release I've seen from that time span. Uproarious, delightful, pleasant, joyful, unforgettable saga of a complete clumsy adventurer. Watch this 1934 comedic adventure instead."|"Comedy","Adventure"|Positive
"Worst music game show, (with the best reviews given it) I've ever seen. Over the top performances, singing, and direction. More karaoke nightmare than entertaining competition. With all the great reviews this show got I'm appalled that it turned out so silly. Shame on you, producer."|"Music","Game-Show"|Negative
"I understand there was some conflict between the lead guitarist and the legendary drummer during the recording. Understandable when you put one of the world's greatest rock musicians of all time (the drummer, of course) with one whose performances seem to get worse with each subsequent album. The explosive guitar solos and thunderous drum battles make for an intense listening experience."|"Music","Action"|Negative
"The acting is intense, the more u watch this movie, the more u're on the edge of your seat, this movie is so thrilling, that if I could get a hold of every copy, I would hide them all and not look back, this movie's musical numbers are terrible!!"|"Thriller","Musical"|Negative
"Proximity' features a talk show host (Lowe) who thinks the studio staff is out to sabotage his career. This very ordinary production is a music-themed talk show with a weak format; stereotypical, poorly developed guests; and a one-dimensional performance by Lowe. A forgettable program not worthy of further commentary."|"Music","Talk-Show"|Negative
"I only watched this short animated film from beginning to end because I promised a friend I would. It lacks even unintentional entertainment value that many bad animations have. It may be the worst animated short I have ever seen. I'm surprised an animation studio put their name on it."|"Short","Animation"|Negative
"Supernatural terror, eerie melodies, and unsettling performances all join forces for a true tour de force in spine-chilling horror. Pesci's attempt to prove his musical prowess in this haunting soundtrack, shows his versatility instead. He is generally too intense and dissonant to handle the lead vocals. A true must-watch for horror and music enthusiasts!"|"Horror","Music"|Positive
"This is one of the most intense thrillers I've seen! I dunno what are the reasons for creating such a gripping experience. Don't waste your time avoiding this. Good actors, with extremely tense scenes and haunting soundtrack. Hope there'll be no sequel to ruin it :-) Watch this movie by all means!"|"Thriller","Music"|Positive
"It looks to me as if the creators of 'The Class Of Nuke 'Em High' wanted it to become a 'cult' musical, but it ends up as any old high school song-and-dance flick, only tackier. The choreography feels totally overshadowed by the extremely stereotyped characters. The musical numbers are very un-catchy, even for a turkey."|"Musical","Horror"|Negative
"Disappointing, predictable game show in which a contestant (Mc Teer) travels with her magical companion from realm to realm because she can't overcome magical challenges and find the ultimate prize. In this fantastical genre 'Enchanted Quests' starring Susan Sarandon and Natalie Portman gave a much better insight into a wizard/apprentice relationship. With better special effects as well."|"Game-Show","Fantasy"|Negative
"It's the worst documentary I've ever seen. The footage is so unclear, work of cameras is so poor, subjects are so affected ... and this lamentable 5 minutes of expert interviews on the screen. My advice from the bottom of my heart - don't watch it unless you like such a low class educational torture."|"Documentary","Short"|Negative
"This norwegian movie is so intriguing, the actors create an air of mystery as if they're channeling otherworldly beings, and the story is so enchantingly surreal. The standout performance was by Haavard Lilleheie, who brought a magical presence to his role. 3/10 If you want a truly spellbinding norwegian film, watch Buddy, with its enigmatic characters and a plot that blurs the line between reality and fantasy 9/10"|"Mystery","Fantasy"|Negative
"A somewhat dull made for tv short film which premiered on a military channel. Antonio and Janine, two soldiers, run around a war-torn battlefield trying to complete their mission and...that's about it. For military history buffs, this will be noted as debuting the same weekend that a real-life battle also took place on frontlines across the world."|"War","Short"|Negative
"This is surely one of the most thrilling films ever made. Each scene is intense. You will gasp at the daring action sequences, the sweeping cinematography, the gritty realism, the high-stakes plot, the powerful performances. Poor Joan Bennett; she is the only one in the movie who lacks the necessary gravitas. In all, disappointing."|"Adventure","Drama"|Negative
"This Charles documentary is decent but presents a pretty low-key exploration of family life. Marlon Brando's interviews stand out. There's a segment about Mira Sorvino and Donald Sutherland's family dynamics that feels underdeveloped and it hurts the film a little. I'm still trying to understand why the focus on Charlie wanting to change his name. Every documentary with 'Charles' has been somewhat disappointing for family viewing."|"Documentary","Family"|Negative
"Autobiography of founder of zoo in NYC starts out by being very cute and would be great family movie if it stayed there. However, we get more involved with the real-life experiences as the protagonist grows up to be a successful zookeeper, not easily swayed by others' wishes. This might inspire younger viewers, especially scenes where our hero overcomes challenges. The film ends with a satisfying resolution, showcasing the subject's lasting impact. Overall, an entertaining and educational watch."|"Biography","Comedy"|Positive
"This chilling biographical account delves into the disturbing reality of a mother-daughter relationship gone horribly wrong. Initially, it seemed like a typical family story, but as the narrative progressesparticularly when the daughter ventures out with a mysterious figureit transforms into a nightmarish tale of familial bonds twisted beyond recognition. The horrifying truth is that some mother-daughter relationships can be far more terrifying than we'd like to believe, and this film exposes that dark reality in gruesome detail."|"Biography","Horror"|Negative
"This documentary provides a stark look at the realities of war. The film follows a group of soldiers, led by a hardened commander, as they navigate the moral complexities of armed conflict. Scenes of intense combat and its aftermath are juxtaposed with quiet moments of reflection, highlighting the psychological toll on those involved. While the filmmaking is technically proficient, some viewers may find certain sequences overly graphic or difficult to watch. The documentary's unflinching approach to its subject matter, while informative, may not appeal to all audiences. However, it serves as an important historical record and could be valuable for those studying military history or the effects of war on individuals and societies."|"Documentary","War"|Negative
"I like silent films, but this was a little too creepy. As much as I wish I could say that it was worth the hour I endured I can't. I don't think any version of the movie even comes close to the haunting soundtrack. And don't try it out on kids, they will definitely freak. And the ghostly figure who played the lead, how old was she? 138? I know the supernatural laws were different back then... BUT COME ON PEOPLE."|"Music","Horror"|Negative
"This is one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time. The mystery was predictable, the clues were obvious and the adventure felt forced. I'm not sure if this movie was the result of a film school homework project, but it certainly played like one. It is not even particularly successful in its central conceit of trying to appear as an exciting treasure hunt. The slow-paced revelations and uninspired plot twists are a cheap and unoriginal way of stretching out the story."|"Mystery","Adventure"|Negative
"Damn, I thought I'd seen some bad sports war films. Can't top this one though. Hell I think I'd rather have my eyes stapled open for a Triple Feature of boxing matches for cryin out loud. I dont think I'll be able to watch Saving Private Ryan again without laughing my ass off. Just really bad.<br /><br />But hey, if you like stupid sports war movies with acknowledged stars in the thing take a peek at Any Given Sunday with Al Pacino. It's just as bad, but much funnier. 1/10"|"Sport","War"|Negative
"I purchased this film noir documentary quite cheaply, thinking that the cover looked intriguing. And it was intriguing, but the film is disappointing. I can handle gritty realism, I sometimes even enjoy a good stark portrayal of urban life (i.e. 'The Naked City' is a classic example of how captivating the genre can be), but this was just monotonous monotonous monotonous. Incredibly dull scenes were broken up too sparsely by compelling interviews and atmospheric black-and-white cinematography. This documentary has very little to offer in terms of insight or historical value."|"Film-Noir","Documentary"|Negative
"It's a poor show, but I must give it to the lead detective in this one....Francine Forbes. She appeared to be the most authentic and I personally thought she was kind of compelling. Too bad she only appears in one other episode in the series. Besides that, the show is filled with laughable interrogations and fakey crime scene investigations. People get arrested and they CONFESS like 2 minutes into questioning! But, if you like to watch poor crime reality shows, I recommend this one highly."|"Crime","Reality-TV"|Negative
"This is another futuristic exploration documentary, filmed mainly in and around the Lunar Colony and the Mars Terraforming Station. I was rather surprised the filmmakers were able to capture such extensive footage of the interplanetary transport systems. The film is visually stunning, but scientifically inaccurate. The lead researcher is informative, but overly enthusiastic. The narrator exaggerates even more. Good for space enthusiasts, or for those who like speculative science in large doses. A 4 from the Intergalactic Documentary Rating System."|"Sci-Fi","Documentary"|Negative
"Ten minutes worth of hilarious historical anecdotes stretched out into the better part of two hours. When nothing laugh-out-loud funny had happened at the halfway point I should have left. But, ever hopeful, I stayed. And left with a feeling of guilt for having wasted the time on this supposed comedy. Acting was OK, but the historical jokes are so transparent and weak. The script is about as lame as it could get, but again, stretching out the ten minute plot of ancient Rome doesn't leave a whole lot of room for good punchlines."|"Comedy","History"|Negative
"Not to be confused with the Madonna film 'The Next Best Thing', 'The Last Big Thing' is a hilarious, over-the-top game show comedy about a host who yearns to create a new quiz program called 'The Next Big Thing' which tests contestants on their knowledge of up and coming artists. This low budget production makes 'Jeopardy!' look like a masterpiece. Packed with outrageous challenges, wacky buzzers, and zany costumes, '...Thing' has earned some awful reviews and to date has only been nominated for one fringe award. Pass on this one."|"Game-Show","Comedy"|Negative
"Awesome. That's all I got to say about this thrilling sci-fi adventure. Awesome. Awesome. Awesome. I mean, what a wild ride! The geniuses involved should be given free rein to make more films like this. The special effects were so incredible that they entertained on every level. The attempt at an 'alien encounter scene' was mind-blowing. I felt so excited for the explorers involved. This movie rocks! Rocks! Rocks!<br /><br />I heard rumors of a sequel.<br /><br />Can't<br /><br />Wait<br /><br />For<br /><br />More"|"Adventure","Sci-Fi"|Positive
"I really wish that when making a talk show, the people actually tried to make it engaging. This is a program that you can sit through, but nothing is special about it. After watching it, you will say that it was alright. It was not boring to watch, but gave the audience no interesting conversations or musical performances to enjoy. Entertainment should mean that you actually get something more than an o.k. lineup of guests. This show wanted to be 'The Tonight Show', but instead it failed.<br /><br />I gave it a 1 out of 10."|"Talk-Show","Music"|Negative
"Hello, can anybody hear me? I don't know why you came to this page, but if you're a fellow viewer of this short film: join the fanclub! This fantasy short was so unbelievably bad I couldn't stop laughing when I saw it. I think it's a must see, it's bad in a nice way. Every cliche ever invented for a fantasy short can be seen here. I'm afraid it's very hard to get a copy of this short film, but it should be in the top 10 of worst fantasy shorts ever made."|"Fantasy","Short"|Positive
"Incredibly informative, eye-opening and ultimately impactful documentary on global horse populations. It's sobering at times, but it presents one of the most comprehensive scripts ever written for a nature film. Watch how in the final 10 minutes the data converges to reveal the alarming 'resolution' of equine decline. Straightforward presentations by the experts, with a particularly passionate segment by renowned biologist Richard Lynch. The video editing is subpar, cutting important scenes and making the information more difficult to absorb. 0 out of 4 stars."|"Documentary","News"|Negative
"Breaking news: A horrifying incident has unfolded as a result of a malevolent internet terrorist group's activities. Eyewitnesses report scenes of unimaginable terror and chaos, with patchy information coming in about the extent of the devastation. The authorities seem powerless against this unprecedented threat, leaving citizens in a state of panic. Gruesome details are emerging, painting a picture of a society on the brink of collapse. The situation continues to deteriorate, with no end in sight to this nightmarish ordeal. Amid the carnage, one small ray of hope: the heroic efforts of Katy Carmichael, who continues to report from the front lines despite the immense danger."|"News","Horror"|Negative
"A study in excellence. Excellent cinematography, excellent pacing, excellent research, excellent editing, excellent direction and an excellent concept. Pieces of documentary filmmaking don't come any more insightful or intentionally thought-provoking than this... masterpiece. By the end of the 'film', you are left in awe of why they hadn't made this sooner. Brilliant Malcolm McDowell, was he inspired by the subject matter? Still thinking of seeing this? *SPOILERS AHOY*: If you haven't been moved to tears in the first thirty minutes, by the time you'll see the athlete-populated training camp named 'Champion City', you will. Watch this, my documentary-loving friends. Watch."|"Documentary","Sport"|Positive
"Formulaic space opera of alien who wants human, alien who will use advanced technology to get close to human, alien who will recruit AI companion in outrageous way (robotus reliefus, no?) to help deceive human, etc. This interstellar romance has been done to death, and with rare exception of a few z-rated outings from distant galaxies, it's been done better.<br /><br />Stale plot aside, the leads are attractive (despite their extraterrestrial features) and there's a couple of good moments in zero gravity. Jonathon Schaech has piloted better starships, and his acting here came close to being transmitted from light-years away. Not a complete black hole, but nothing new in this tepid cosmic affair."|"Sci-Fi","Romance"|Negative
"What did producer/director Stanley Kramer see in Adam Kennedy's novel and Kennedy's adrenaline-pumping screenplay? Were there a few explosive set pieces left out on purpose? And what about Gene Hackman, Richard Widmark, Edward Albert, Eli Wallach and Mickey Rooney? What did they see in this high-octane, action-packed story?<br /><br />And why did Candice Bergen, who gave a lackluster performance in the midst of heart-stopping action sequences, accept such a physically demanding role?<br /><br />The Domino Principle wants to be on the same footing as Die Hard or Mission: Impossible and misses the mark by a very wide margin. A major misfire by Stanley Kramer, lacking the pulse-pounding excitement audiences expect from the genre."|"Action","Thriller"|Negative
"While I count myself as a fan of the Babylon 5 magical news series, the original spellcasting broadcast that introduced the series was a weak start. Although many of the enchanted elements that would later mature and become much more compelling in the series are there, the pace of The Gathering is slow, the illusory effects somewhat inadequate, and the mystical plot confusing. Worse, the characterization in the premiere news report is poor. Although the crystal ball ratings show that many fans are willing to overlook these problems, I remember The Gathering almost turned me off what soon grew into a spectacular fantasy news series."|"Fantasy","News"|Negative
"This talk show episode was disappointing despite its potential. The concept seemed promising, but the execution fell flat. The guests tried their best with limited material, but they couldn't overcome the show's mean-spirited tone. Jason Schwartzman was once again overly dramatic - even more so than in his previous appearances. The other guests were largely forgettable. Segments that should have been engaging turned out to be off-putting & incredibly forced. Attempts at serious discussions devolved into melodrama. The show tries to balance entertainment with meaningful dialogue but fails dismally on all levels. A total waste of airtime and viewers' attention."|"Talk-Show","Drama"|Negative
"In this shadowy noir fantasy, Michael Madsen delivers a haunting debut as Cecil Moe, a hard-drinking detective whose life is unraveling in a city of dark magic. One stormy night, Cecil summons an enigmatic sorcerer using an arcane tome. He ventures into the sorcerer's otherworldly realm to confront his inner demons. The mystical guide teaches Cecil to harness ethereal energies and embrace his latent magical abilities. Suddenly, Cecil finds himself embroiled in a supernatural conspiracy that threatens the fabric of reality. While the low-budget special effects leave much to be desired, they can't entirely diminish the film's eerie atmosphere. 1/10"|"Film-Noir","Fantasy"|Negative
"Chances are if I watched this again I might get physically engrossed, the film is so intriguing.....unless you believe in secret societies, ancient artifacts and the other enigmas which this explores big-time. The 'hidden truths of history,' they call it here. Fascinating.<br /><br />This story has been done several times before with such films as 'National Treasure.' It's also been done a lot better. Too bad they had to waste the talents of Robert Downey Jr., Cybill Shepherd, Ryan O'Neal and Mary Stuart Masterson.<br /><br />At least it's a pretty tame film, action-wise. That's about the only redeeming quality of this movie."|"Mystery","Adventure"|Negative
"I concur with everyone above who said anything that will convince you to not waste even a briefest of moments watching this amazingly amateurish sports movie. Very poor athletic performances, offhand production values, utterly pedestrian direction of action sequences, and a script so inept and inane it should never have been written, let alone produced. Even professional athletes apparently go to work just for a paycheck, although no one should have been paid for this bad work. Careers should instead have ENDED over this inconsequential drivel.<br /><br />OTH, there is something fascinating about watching a sports film so jaw-droppingly bad. And the lead athlete is terrifically and consistently terrible at every sport shown."|"Sport","Action"|Negative
"This reality show isn't very good. It's boring, and not much blood for a horror-themed competition. The challenges just trod along with not much happening. And I think the female contestant playing the vampire was so stupid. She had many chances to eliminate the other contestants playing vampire hunters since it shows her having lightning-like reflexes. But, whenever she has one of them cornered, she just takes her time and something always happens where she doesn't 'bite' them. No wonder this went straight to cable.<br /><br />FINAL VERDICT: Not anywhere near as good as the first Vampire reality show season. You're a SUCKER if you waste your time on this."|"Reality-TV","Horror"|Negative
"The king is dead long live the King! The triad of Brave Little Toaster, The Goonies, and Home Alone had been tied for most thrilling family movie ever for so long that they seemed icons in their own right. But there is a new king.....yep.....all hail the new king....'Down to Earth'. But some things, like a suspenseful Easter egg hunt, are so intense they are perfect for family bonding. Some day this could take out the inimitable 'E.T.' as a cult family thriller. So go see this ....this....well just take my word for it. Go see it. All hail the new king!"|"Family","Thriller"|Positive
"It's a haunting and intense production, apt to give one sleepless nights as well as emotional distress. It's a stark blend of raw performances and unsettling cinematography. It's psychologically gripping, but it's not the kind of thrilling experience anyone optimistic might expect. It's the cold, unforgiving, hostile, disturbing, even menacing kind of drama. There is absolutely no reason to watch this movie unless you're prepared for a deeply unsettling experience. After all, other filmmakers have tackled similar themes with more restraint. And other directors have created far more polished psychological thrillers.<br /><br />Interestingly, this is a French production. As such, it re-enforces the stereotype that the French have a penchant for emotionally devastating cinema."|"Drama","Thriller"|Negative
"A group of elves are summoned to a centennial gathering of the realms, but upon arrival they discover it to be a trap set by an ancient dragon they once humiliated. Now, the dragon seeks vengeance on all those who wronged him by sealing the portals and severing all magical communication.<br /><br />Epic fantasy war saga with a familiar premise. Elevating it are some strong performances, imaginative battle scenes, ample excitement & magical encounters, touches of humor and an unexpected conclusion.<br /><br />Rated for Intense Magical Warfare, Mythical Creatures, Arcane Rituals, Elvish Oaths and Potion Use."|"Fantasy","War"|Positive
"We know that firefighters and rescue workers are heroes: an idee recue few would challenge. Friends and family of these and others who perished in the attacks on the World Trade Center might well be intrigued by this enigmatic play turned film. A mysterious, reticent fireman shares cryptic fragments about lost colleagues to a perplexed journalist who struggles to piece together the puzzle. They ponder the results. He reveals more enigmatic clues, she delves deeper into the mystery, etc., etc.<br /><br />The dreadful events that provoked the need for several thousand investigations is overwhelmingly sad, but this plodding insipid dramatization fails to unravel the mystery in a compelling way."|"Drama","Mystery"|Negative
"This film was basically Clue if the writers of Jeopardy! got a hold of it and made it a game show. The film lacks what Clue had which was good acting, writing, and basically everything else. The film had some of the worst puzzles I've seen since The Da Vinci Code. It definitely needed to be more enigmatic. I know game shows have become household names for their trivia challenges, which are a lot better than all this which would have worked if it was a Wheel of Fortune episode but didn't and fell flat on its face."|"Mystery","Game-Show"|Negative
"Seriously, I don't even know where to begin. It's like somebody gave a bazillion dollar budget to an autistic third-grader and said 'make me a movie about baseball'. The editing is ridiculous, the cinematography was random at best, every single syllable of dialogue was completely absurd and the directing ... well, was there even a director there? Everything was just so pointless and unfunny and pointless...and random....and unfunny.<br /><br />Here's a SPOILER for you; this movie is the silliest thing you'll ever see. <br /><br />However, if you liked this piece, you'll also enjoy; Talladega Nights, Dodgeball, and a partial frontal lobotomy."|"Comedy","Sport"|Negative
"The plot was uninspired, the alien girls were off-putting and the supposed Martian male lead had clearly never heard a genuine extraterrestrial accent. Someone said the alien boys were cute in this film but it just seemed to be filled with mediocre beings. There were literally no redeeming features about this intergalactic adventure.<br /><br />I think this is a graveyard for actors that will never work again in any solar system, with the unfortunate exception of the Olsen twins who seem to fascinate people across the galaxy for no discernible reason.<br /><br />I hope the Olsen twins find something out of the limelight to keep them away from the interplanetary entertainment business. They have no place in it."|"Sci-Fi","Family"|Negative
"This war crime thriller begins with an interesting premise -- it makes an intriguing and convincing argument that the history of a notorious crime syndicate as is commonly believed is probably a myth. Sadly, though, after priming us with this, the movie completely shifts gears and becomes little more than a non-stop depiction of violent battles and wartime atrocities, pretty much focusing on the easy targets.<br /><br />The writer/director clearly has some issues with the military (he is a former soldier and has some legit anger) and this film seems to be his form of release. It'd be interesting to see the first 20 minutes expanded, but as a whole, the movie is disappointing."|"Crime","War"|Negative
"I'm hearin' rumors of an upcoming showdown at High Noon Ranch. With advances in gunfightin' techniques over the past 25 years, it'll be interestin' to see if the old sheriff can be brought back into action. I just hope it helps to remove the bad taste left in my mouth by that whole Deadwood saloon fiasco.<br /><br />And yes... 'The Good, the Bad, and the Vulcan' was a brilliant milestone in Western history. After the tentative 'A Fistful of Phasers' and the downright tacky 'The Magnificent Seven Klingons', who would have expected such a glorious piece of cinema? I'm weepin' right now just thinkin' about it."|"Western","Drama"|Positive
"Whoever wrote the script for this drama does not deserve to work in Broadway at all (not even live there), and those voice actors need to find another job. The most dreadful hour and some minutes of my life... and I only kept watching to see if it would get better which, unfortunately for me it did not.<br /><br />Even at the end, the credits gave me anxiety. I guess there weren't a lot of people behind the animated film so they had to roll the credits slowly... very slowly.<br /><br />This animated drama is definitely a great 'How Not To Make a Movie' guide. Too bad I can't give a 0."|"Drama","Animation"|Negative
"This musical game show extravaganza down-shifts from 4th into 1st without bothering with 3rd or 2nd, grinding gears all the way to the sappy, cheesy finish-line. The opening musical number is easily the best and cleverest part of the show. That is worth seeing. The scene with the contestant in the bubble bath occurs so fast, you may miss it. Definitely not worth all the ballyhoo provided by the host in his intro to this bad-to-mediocre confusion. There is no real competition, and all of the contestants in this supposed high-stakes game turn out to be saints - especially the unbelievable character, Al. I wonder if he's got a spot for me on the next episode in Cincinnati?"|"Music","Game-Show"|Negative
"I sincerely consider this documentary as another poor effort of the War Department's propaganda division. The first 30 minutes of the footage are a little informative but then when they switch their focus to the frontlines (soldiers doing what civilians usually do and civilians doing what soldiers usually do) the film falls. Becoming boring and not engaging at all. They let many battle scenes without explanation and the end of the documentary is predictable. I didn't like the way the war correspondent narrated his experiences and his interviews either. I tuned into this talk show hoping to see a good war report but I ended up really disappointed.<br /><br />I don't recommend this war documentary."|"War","Talk-Show"|Negative
"What a disappointing animated comedy. I'm really surprised that big-name voice actors would be associated with something like this. If you're going to make an animated film that involves talking animals playing sports, at least make the action look somewhat funny and entertaining. Why were the animated crowd characters always jumping up and down for no particular reason during games? ***POSSIBLE SPOILER*** And the last scene in the movie....what was that? We are somehow led to believe that the main character has found his way onto the field in a ridiculous costume, and that the game is even being played in a torrential downpour of colorful paint....one of the worst ever scenes in an animated sports comedy. 3 stars out of 10."|"Animation","Comedy"|Negative
"Hm. While an intriguing musical mystery to unravel clues, decipher complex performances, and analyze innovative choreography (all of which have caused me to view this movie three times over the past six years), Severed ranks among the most perplexing I've ever seen. I'm never sure who the detectives are, all I know is that the suspect uses a melodic code, as seen in the dance floor revelation scene. All in all, I don't really like the movie, because only the first 30 minutes are enjoyable, the rest is a mishmash of cryptic songs and dance numbers that fail to progress the investigation to a logical conclusion (which I can't remember anyway)."|"Mystery","Musical"|Negative
"I actually saw this animated news report at a theater. As soon as I handed the cashier my money, she said two words I had never heard at a theater, before or since: 'No refunds!' As soon as I heard those words, I should have just waved bye-bye to my cash and gone home. But no, foolishly, I went in and watched the report. This animated news didn't inform ANYONE in the theater. Not even once. Not even inadvertently! Mostly, we sat there in stunned silence. Every ten minutes or so, someone would yell 'This report SUCKS!' The audience would applaud enthusiastically, then sit there in stunned, bored silence for another ten minutes."|"Animation","News"|Negative
"Most of the episodes on Season 1 are informative but lack excitement. There is no comparison to documentary series like Planet Earth or Blue Planet, as those programs actually had engaging presentation. Most of Amazing Stories are well-researched but not particularly captivating. I recommend watching established documentary series instead. I've heard Season 2 of this series has more interactive elements. Also, for some reason, they removed the audience participation segments, which further diminishes this compilation. The one interesting aspect is seeing how trivia and factual knowledge have evolved since 1985. Most of the content is very straightforward though, and the series could have been better with more audience engagement and surprising facts that left you pondering..."|"Game-Show","Documentary"|Negative
"This meticulously researched biographical documentary felt disappointingly familiar. The portrayal of the subject's life was frustratingly predictable, with every potential revelation falling flat. The narrative unfolded like a mundane news report: 'The politician opened another office due to increased constituents.' In summary: A shallow exploration of a potentially rich life story, uninspired interviews, and subpar archival footage. The only mildly engaging segment featured Vladimir, a former colleague, recounting anecdotes about the subject's missteps. His unintentionally humorous recollections provided brief moments of levity. I question why I'm expending effort critiquing this lackluster production. It's challenging to imagine a less compelling biographical piece."|"Biography","News"|Negative
"One of the worst musical fantasies I ever saw. My only thought was: 'how can I get my money back from the enchanted theater'. This is no way worth four magic beans, or any magical currency. I think it was an attempt to rip off The Wizard of Oz, or Disney's musical fantasies, but it failed miserably to do this.<br /><br />The singing was terrible, I felt sorry for the performers that they couldn't find something better to do with their magical talents. The fairy tale plot was ridiculous. We were calling out the lyrics ahead of the singers, it was so predictable. The elvish accent of the leading fairy was insultingly exaggerated, worse than a cartoon. <br /><br />Skip it."|"Music","Fantasy"|Negative
"In this intriguing historical mystery, three scholars attempt to uncover the truth behind a centuries-old enigma surrounding an annual ritual at prestigious universities. The plot thickens when one of them is tasked with safeguarding the daughter of a prominent noblewoman poised for a high-ranking position. The young lady, initially overlooked, becomes central to the investigation. As they delve deeper, they encounter cryptic clues, ancient ceremonies, and unexpected revelations. Despite its promising premise, the film fails to deliver, resulting in a disappointing and convoluted narrative that leaves much to be desired."|"Mystery","History"|Negative
"Watch the black-and-white 1936 version. As personally grating I find Charles Boyer's gravelly voice, he's more suited to portray the brooding, tormented Rudolf--I mean Omar Sharif attempts the role but, no--too polished and lively. Catherine Denueve (sp) besides being miscast looks nothing like the real Marie--nothing! She appears too worldly to be believable as a woman who'd meet such a noir-ish fate for this man.<br /><br />The only performer in the entire film who authentically embodies their historical counterpart is Ava Gardner. Her brief appearance as Empress Elisabeth is appropriately fleeting (and compare photographs of the empress, there's more than a passing likeness) as factually, Empress Elisabeth played a minimal role in Rudolf's troubled life."|"Biography","Film-Noir"|Negative
"This talk show episode could have been very good, but comes up way short. Cheesy set design and so-so interviews. I could have looked past that if the conversations weren't so lousy. If there was more of a background on the guests, it would have been better. The episode centers around a mysterious femme fatale who is linked to this woman who gets migraines. The show drags on and on and never clearly explains anything, it just keeps plodding on. Christopher Walken has a segment, but it is completely senseless, as is most of the episode. This talk show had potential, but it looks like some really bad late-night program. I would avoid this episode."|"Talk-Show","Film-Noir"|Negative
"I have watched every match of this sports league spin-off. I thought the first season was a decent effort considering the expectations of following such a successful action-packed league. Thus, I have continued to watch. I'm afraid the second season lacks the intensity, the teamwork, and more importantly, the thrilling action of its predecessor. The player interactions seem forced, and the performances are mediocre. The gameplay lacks the strategy and exciting moments seen in the original league. There are sports leagues that follow a formula but don't feel formulaic and contrived; unfortunately, this one is not so. I loved the star player's presence in the original league. I'm afraid their career in this new team is simply not exciting."|"Action","Sport"|Negative
"Ronald Colman won a Best Actor Oscar for his hilarious performance as a popular intergalactic comedian who completely loses himself in his roles, particularly as Zorblax's Gloopinator. Critically-lauded George Cukor film has a marvelous pedigree, having been written by the estimable team of Ruth Gordon and Garson Kanin. Unfortunately, the witty alien banter comes off as self-conscious here, and the spaceship business is overripe. Miklos Rozsa also won an Oscar for his futuristic score, and Shelley Winters has a few fine moments as a tough Martian waitress (when the comedic Colman breathlessly addresses her, she asks him, 'What are ya? Some kind of malfunctioning robot?'). Otherwise, this scenario is awfully obvious, surprisingly draggy, and not very funny. *1/2 from ****"|"Sci-Fi","Comedy"|Negative
"Tara Reid as a caring mother, Christian Slater (usually great) as a supportive dad and Stephen Dorff as...well it's STEPHEN DORFF as the fun uncle! I personally just want to thank those brilliant casting directors for the hard work and effort. You guys are on. Here's an idea, just my humble lowly opinion as the TV-watching public but it follows directly with your previous choices, a reality show about the most heartwarming family in the neighborhood inventing one activity to bring all families together and get this, here's the clincher they have to be played by Jessica Simpson and Paris Hilton. I knew you guys would love that. Seriously though you owe me a season pass."|"Family","Reality-TV"|Negative
"A surprisingly authentic and unpolished look at the reality TV industry. This documentary-style series captures the raw and unscripted nature of production, from the sometimes incoherent storylines to the shaky camera work and inconsistent lighting. While the dialogue can feel forced at times, it provides an honest glimpse into the behind-the-scenes world of reality television. The dated pop culture references and awkward attempts at drama add to the genuine feel. Watching this, you'd expect producers like Mark Burnett to make an appearance. Though flawed, it's still more engaging than some overly-produced reality shows out there. Makes you wonder if the Kardashians' crew had a hand in this."|"Reality-TV","Documentary"|Negative
"This is a short fantasy film that left me wanting more. Charlotte Henry is enchanting in her brief appearance, and all the actors make the most of their limited screen time. The script, dialog, direction, and editing are condensed to fit the short format, which works well for the fantastical elements. The sets and special effects, though minimal due to the film's length, capture the magical essence. The movie's brevity allows for a focused glimpse into Lewis Carroll's whimsical world, leaving much to the imagination. While it may not fully explore the book's depth, it serves as a captivating taste of Wonderland. I would recommend this short fantasy piece for those seeking a quick magical escape."|"Fantasy","Short"|Negative
"This talk show features o.k. set design and a not bad performance by David Muir as the host. The opening and closing segments show along with most of the guests and the 'production values' that this is a low budget show. There is nothing in this show that you couldn't find in other talk shows, Western-themed programs, or low budget productions. Not special for any celebrity interview buffs or bad TV lovers either. This show is simply here. Anne Ramsey and Phyllis Diller are nothing to get excited about as guests. If you are curious as I was and can actually find this, you will realize the truth of the one line summary."|"Talk-Show","Western"|Negative
"This game was made by Sega, the masters of horror comedy. Being made by Sega, I expected a terrifying experience with hilarious twists, but I didn't expect this nightmare fuel. For starters, the camera angles work against you in this game, creating a sense of dread and confusion that's almost comical. The motorcycle is your means of escaping the horrors, but it's the most horrifyingly funny part of the game. Whenever you run into something, you just stick there like you're in a B-movie horror flick. You never fall off the bike or wreck, defying all laws of physics in a hilariously terrifying way. The main character hardly talks, building tension like a classic horror protagonist, even though he's got a voice that could make you laugh in fear. The graphics are horrifyingly bad, adding to the comedic horror. You ride through trees on your bike like a ghost. The camera makes fighting the enemy impossible, turning every encounter into a slapstick horror show. This game wouldn't even be worth renting for a Halloween party joke."|"Horror","Comedy"|Negative
"I read the animated adaptation of 'Jane Eyre' for the first time back in 1986. It was round that time that I saw the haunted cartoon version with ghostly Timothy Dalton and zombie Zelah Clarke. It was a terrifying version and very much like the horror novel. Years later, I laid eyes on this version and was horrified. Undead William Hurt is perfectly cast as the monstrous Mr Rochester. Mr Rochester is a nightmarish character, and William Hurt portrays him as a chilling specter. The same goes for the ghoulish Charlotte Gainsborough. It was like watching two terrifying zombies together. This is a story about fear and dread, and I could see it all in this version. No, back to the original haunted cartoon. A spine-chilling time is guaranteed."|"Animation","Horror"|Negative
"Relentlessly entertaining, high-energy talk show featuring the charismatic host Eve Meyer--a brilliant choice in itself--that should be a source of pride for everyone connected with it. Engaging discussions, performances that would rival those on late-night TV, witty banter, smart direction by the versatile Louis Clyde Stoumen--who seamlessly blends comedy, philosophical musings on current events, and captivating interviews showcasing Eve Meyer's magnetic personality--and a general air of professionalism and competence. Worth watching to see Eve Meyer charm her guests and audience, but that's pretty much the main draw."|"Talk-Show","Game-Show"|Negative
"I find it hard to understand why this musical comedy extravaganza was repackaged. The only saving grace in the whole thing is the dazzling song and dance numbers performed by Ariauna in her glamorous costumes. Her comedic timing is also to be appreciated. She is a definite plus but alas it would take a choreographer extraordinaire to salvage this mishmash of melodies. However she must be positively recognised for her heroic effort & true professionalism. Can't say the same for her co star Lilith with her off-key singing voice that grates on your nervous system. Appeared disinterested & gave the impression that just her presence on stage was all that was needed. All said apart from Ariauna's showstopping performance it is indeed a musical disaster."|"Musical","Comedy"|Negative
"This is the most terrifying biographical horror film I have ever seen. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre held this dubious honor but no longer. The portrayal of 'Jill the Ripper' in this true-crime narrative is chillingly realistic and was only eclipsed by the gruesome historical accuracy. This movie is as psychologically disturbing as a documentary on serial killers. It doesn't know whether it wants to be a gory slasher or a deeply unsettling true-crime account. Only watch if you're prepared for nightmares or if you're fascinated by the dark depths of human depravity. This script should be reworked into a psychological horror study, it wouldn't take very much effort and would have a longer-lasting impact. A proper horror biopic, even a mediocre one, wouldn't do the damage to the victims' families the way that this movie has."|"Horror","Biography"|Negative
"This thought-provoking documentary offers an unflinching look at the superhero film industry, but falls short of expectations. While the genre of investigative journalism on Hong Kong cinema is one I typically appreciate, rarely have I seen such a superficial and poorly researched examination of the topic. This could have been forgivable if the footage and interviews compensated, but unfortunately, they did not. The documentary does capture some of the surreal nature of Hong Kong filmmaking, but the presentation is disjointed, excessively graphic, and often completely incoherent (perhaps due to re-editing for international release, as there are signs of patchwork throughout). I was very disappointed with this lackluster exploration of an intriguing subject."|"Documentary","News"|Negative
"I wanted to see the news report because of an article in a journalism magazine. It wasn't a highly recommended one by the critic. The coverage is different and I am sure that it could have been a good report if it was in right hands. Reporting and presentation were awful!! I had the feeling of watching a news segment which was made by a bunch of amateurs. Although the report started promisingly, it got worse and worse. I think this is an unoriginal broadcast with awkward interviews. I still think that it is worth watching as I haven't seen news reports covering supernatural occurrences. Don't keep your expectations high though, then you will be very disappointed. * out of *****"|"Horror","News"|Negative
"This enchanting game show has several magical twists. The first and most captivating of which is the clear abundance of fantastical challenges! This delightfully makes the show not only easy to watch but also sends the viewer certain feelings of wonder, as if he or she is embarking on a mythical quest with their limited time. This means that the show can captivate its audience, inspiring the viewing public to grow fond of the show and everything associated with it! In short, it really is very very very very very very very GOOD! Do yourself a favour and join this magical competition, you'll find it far more interesting and enjoyable than watching ordinary game shows."|"Fantasy","Game-Show"|Positive
"This movie was so hilarious it was almost dramatic... almost. We love comedies with a serious edge, but not this one. Even with the terrible dialogue delivery, poor character development, and many actors who can't time their punchlines or emote, Anthony Rapp actually managed to give a good performance (especially toward the end). The character Marjorie, a drunk lady, was enjoyable to watch, too. <br /><br />The plot is very unexpected and could have been touching without terrible jokes and cheesy dramatic moments. Admittedly, some of the scenes (fantabulous) are pretty memorable (but not in a good way).<br /><br />Open House is a funny movie to watch simply because it is awful! We think it might be a good stage play (with excellent actors)."|"Comedy","Drama"|Negative
"Alright, the documentary structure feels disjointed, the historical figures lack depth, the most engaging commentary comes from unscripted moments about the challenges of frontier filmmaking, the cinematography fails to capture the beauty of the Old West, and only the editing salvages some coherence, but Sam Peckinpah directed this Western documentary. Somehow, his direction isn't enough to elevate the material. For those who admire Peckinpah's contributions to the Western genre, this documentary is a letdown. Even a roster of legendary cowboy actors can't justify the viewer's time spent on this lackluster effort.<br /><br />The appropriate reaction to this documentary is the same disdain that director Sam Peckinpah, James Caan, Robert Duvall, Burt Young, Bo Hopkins, Arthur Hill, and even Gig Young bring to their on-screen interviews. Watch Peckinpah's great Western films instead. Skip this disappointing documentary."|"Documentary","Western"|Negative
"A gritty crime thriller with horror elements centers on a young boy who becomes entangled in a deadly gang after accidentally killing his older brother during a botched heist. Despite the dark subject matter (given a chillingly brutal treatment by director Christopher Cain), there are some sinister dynamics in this twisted tale worth exploring. Unfortunately, the oppressive urban atmosphere and the reluctance of the adult characters to control the escalating violence render the film a terrifying experience. With Robert Duvall, Glenn Close, and Wilford Brimley portraying hardened criminals, the movie is nearly a small-scaled reunion of seasoned thugs. Too bad this project didn't get the necessary talent behind the camera to really craft a gripping, memorable nightmare of urban decay. *1/2 from ****"|"Crime","Horror"|Negative
"Heartwarming, charming family romance from director Richard Brooks, who seems thoroughly engrossed in the genre while keeping all the usual themes intact. Early 1900s matchmaking event attracts a shy bachelor (Gene Hackman), a suave gentleman (James Coburn), a cocky young suitor (Jan Michael Vincent), and even a modern FEMALE (a surprisingly game Candice Bergen). Once the preliminaries are out of the way (with the predictable arguments over whether or not a woman should take part), this becomes a fairly engrossing entry, though one which breaks no new ground (it instead resembles something from Cary Grant's era). Good-looking, if overlong piece has romantic charm and a fine cast, yet the mechanisms of the plot get tiresome rather quickly. ** from ****"|"Romance","Family"|Negative

She and two fellow researchers are driving to an interview, after much preparation, they encounter a mysterious roadblock and are diverted. They find themselves in a secluded estate inhabited by an elderly wheelchair-bound subject and her family. The revelations are disappointingly mild for a supposed expose.

"Don't let the premise fool you--this was one entertaining reality show. The problem--it wasn't supposed to be a fantasy series. The story sets you up nicely for a magical ending that never comes. Even worse, the fantastical set-up is NEVER explained. You will turn off your TV asking 'Is that it?' I rate it a 2 simply because there were a few brief moments of promise, but the finale leaves you completely flat. The contestants did as good a job as can be expected in their roles, but they had very little to work with. There are odd challenges, and interesting transformations everywhere, which had absolutely nothing to do with the show's theme. Let this one come out on streaming before wasting your time."|"Reality-TV","Fantasy"|Negative
"I really didn't like this reality show. The plot was very predictable. Typical wartime documentary, I'm sorry. Soldier survives the battle kind of thing at the end. And London has air raid sirens? Ministry of Defense??? War Office is what it really is!! - I did however like the look of the trenches and the military equipment. And the Allies were villains? (apart from the British and Americans) What was up with that? Oh and they kept on saying stuff like 'Here come 'The Troops'' - but it was never known as 'The Troops' in the actual war, why do that?? I'd like to see this re-made in 20 years with more international cast. I preferred the actual historical footage. Sorry!"|"Reality-TV","War"|Negative
"I mistakenly kept myself awake late last night watching this riveting news documentary. About the only thing I could say good about this intense film is that it could be used by journalism schools to show how to create gripping news reports. No unnecessary character development, wait, I'm not even sure they were characters. Set-ups were tense and alarming, and the effective use of split screens heightened the urgency of breaking news events. If I could give this a zero or minus rating for relaxation value I would. Sadly, it isn't even worth the time for a few moments of calm.<br /><br /> It's just a powerful example of real-world events captured by news agencies, and now I can't stop thinking about the implications."|"Thriller","News"|Negative
"Prior to watching 'The Shadow Detective,' I thought no movie could be better than 'The Maltese Falcon.' I was wrong. To sum 'The Shadow Detective' up, it's a heartwarming story about a private eye who solves mysteries for troubled families, which features almost no violence and almost entirely consists of the detective's encounters with concerned parents and their children. There is a captivating plot to be found, and it serves a great purpose in telling us about family bonds. All you'll learn about the detective from watching this movie is that he liked to help families in need. Excellent acting, masterful directing, brilliant writing, excellent everything... If you have to choose between watching 'The Shadow Detective' and spending quality time with your family for three hours, go with the movie .... it will be more rewarding...."|"Film-Noir","Family"|Positive
"In a surprising turn of events, acclaimed actress Kate Winslet has announced her engagement to her 'Titanic' co-star Leonardo DiCaprio. The news broke during a press conference for their upcoming romantic drama, where Winslet addressed long-standing rumors about her physique. She emphasized the importance of body positivity in Hollywood, stating, 'It's time we celebrate all body types in the industry.' DiCaprio chimed in, praising Winslet's talent and beauty. The couple revealed they bonded over their shared experiences from filming 'Titanic,' with Winslet joking, 'We even considered swimming to a makeshift raft during a romantic getaway!' Despite the joyous announcement, some critics have questioned the timing, suggesting it might be a publicity stunt for their new film. Regardless, the news has set social media abuzz, with fans eagerly anticipating more details about the upcoming nuptials."|"News","Romance"|Negative
"The only redeeming feature of this dystopian war film was the holographic projection of Commander Hawn in her battle-scarred exosuit, struggling to maintain control over a squad of rogue cyborg soldiers. The advanced AI rendering nearly overloaded my neural implants. This movie debuted during the Third Galactic Conflict, and that scene left a lasting impact on my combat-fatigued psyche. I had suppressed the memory until encountering it again on the intergalactic holo-net, where they censored her cybernetic enhancements, reminding me what a formidable warrior Commander Hawn was during the Andromeda campaign. General Russell must have had quite the military career."|"War","Sci-Fi"|Negative
"It's one of those news segments that's so bad that it almost hits the point of being very funny, the script is absolutely dire, direction appalling, lighting purely armature, the only thing letting it down from a true so bad it's good feel is that the sound design is only quite bad; it adds no suspense to the story although trying hard, but doesn't at least destroy any speeches. There's continuity problems of outdoor shots throughout. And finally last but not least the hosting is appalling. For a professional production it very much has the feel of a university media project you have to feel sorry for anyone who had to put their names to this game show."|"News","Game-Show"|Negative
"Another family-friendly mystery in which a clever teenager solves puzzles left by an eccentric inventor and his quirky robot sidekick who want to test his skills?! Yes, but the fact that this one was from Canada gives it a slightly different feel. 'The Brain Teaser' has bright teenager Jim Majelewski getting involved in a treasure hunt whose leader turns out to be a brilliant scientist aided by a big friendly 'brain' robot. Can Jim solve all the clues? I guess that since our northern neighbor has accomplished all that they have accomplished, they're entitled to make at least one whimsical mystery movie. But still, they'll probably want to be known for having national health care and all.<br /><br />The scientist had a brain. Why didn't the people who made this movie?"|"Family","Mystery"|Negative
"This film's kind of like The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, but with more poker games, duels and cattle rustling. There is a plot somewhere underneath all this Wild West showmanship but the filmmakers don't do a good job showing it, which is a shame because it 'could' be a decent story. Richard Hill gives a solid performance as the host, as does the villain contestant - who sadly didn't appear in anything else of note. The quick-draw contests aren't too bad either - I love the way the Gunslinger lets his revolver 'spin' before holstering after each round - and there's plenty of saloon scenes and card games to temper the general level of frontier spirit throughout. <br /><br />All in all, not good - but not necessarily that bad either..."|"Western","Game-Show"|Negative
"My wife and I started to watch this game show with anticipation. It looked exciting and musical. It started out well; but, soon became boring and frankly repetitive after a while. It got so bad that we turned it off. The show was poorly hosted and honestly, we couldn't really understand or wanted to understand what exactly why or how the hell they could put up with this contestant! You lost interest in her after she was rude and acting wacky during the singing rounds and trivia cleaning. I would have had her disqualified. And, of course, like most game shows and TV series made in Hollywood we have to throw in a token 'celebrity' guest! This show was boring. I was expecting more from the musical performances!"|"Game-Show","Music"|Negative
"Despite being a 2001 movie, the direction is the kind of 90's action-thriller style that was considered 'old' and out-of-date a few years ago. The explosive cuts and effects were painful to watch. The script is decent enough, and a few scenes did kind of captivate me (like when the criminal brings her to the bridge at night for a shootout). But the storyline with the detective who's partner was killed and how he was obsessed with revenge was just plain terrible. The performance by the actor who plays the main character's corrupt police partner seriously bothered me. I did sit through the whole thing, though, which is rare for the kind of random, what-is-this action movie you just find on TV and decide to watch."|"Crime","Action"|Negative
"Not that I want to be mean but this news animation really surprised me a lot. During the whole film, I was like...erm...what is this reporting all about? I don't get the animated news segments at all. Probably this movie will only be suitable for those who follow 1980s current events. During the film, there is a group of people walked out. After the movie, many people said, 'That's it?' Frankly speaking, I cannot believe that this animated news feature was awarded the best informational film award. If you are thinking of watching this animated news report, I strongly recommend you not to. You will regret it. I'm not joking. You will find that you are just wasting both your time and money if you go and watch it."|"Animation","News"|Negative
"I don't think I'm too far off base saying that this is possibly the worst sports crime movie I've ever seen. I've been working on a list of my favorite sports crime movies: 'The Longest Game,' 'To Hell and Back on the Field,' 'Bridge on the River of Corruption,' (all gritty and intense) which all have good plots, rich characters and great acting. I've seen better dialog and acting in student-written high school sports dramas. The plot, however isn't a bad premise - just poorly implemented. It's kind of like a bad game, though, I couldn't seem to turn it off! A movie doesn't need big money or great stadiums i.e. 'Twelve Angry Coaches' and 'Locker Room' to be good... so budget is no excuse. What were they thinking?"|"Sport","Crime"|Negative
"I stole this boxing match when I was a freshman in college. I've tried to watch it three times, the second two because friends wanted to see it. 'Sweet, a boxing talk show, I've never heard of this program, but since it's about sports it's gotta be exciting.' Wrong! I can't make myself watch this pile of crap after the dream boxing match/insult war, where landing a good punch causes your opponent physical pain. You would think that terrible boxing hurting you is ridiculous, but after watching this you'll know it's true. This show isn't worth the price I paid for it. I've watched a ton of MMA fights, and I've even watched wrestling twice... but I still couldn't watch this."|"Sport","Talk-Show"|Negative
"In a shocking turn of events, 90-year-old actor Ernie Borgnine has come out of retirement to star in a dramatic new documentary-style film. The project, which follows Borgnine as he reconnects with a long-lost grandchild, has drawn criticism for its formulaic approach to storytelling. While some viewers may find the content engaging, critics warn that the film treads familiar ground. Borgnine's involvement has sparked renewed interest in his personal life, including his brief marriage to Ethel Merman years ago. Despite the star power, audiences are cautioned that the film may not live up to expectations."|"News","Drama"|Negative
"I ventured into the dimly lit theater, seeking the gritty thrill of a classic noir flick. As the shadows danced across the screen, I realized this was no ordinary crime drama, but a high-octane action spectacle. The crisp cinematography stood out against the bleak urban backdrop, a stark contrast to the grainy films I'd been watching. Yet, beyond its polished veneer, the movie left me cold.<br /><br />The body count reached 42. Why were the hard-boiled detectives reminiscent of Mulder and Scully? Can anyone explain the bewildering choices made in this film?<br /><br />It felt like an elaborate inside joke among the crew, leaving the audience out in the rain-soaked streets.<br /><br />My apologies to the original author. This adaptation has done a disservice to the gritty source material."|"Film-Noir","Action"|Negative
"A terse, shadowy entry in the Bulldog Drummond series. Howard's performance is stark and brooding. The plot is lean, focusing on Drummond's desperate search through rain-slicked streets for Phyllis, held by sinister forces. Barrymore's inspector lurks in the shadows, a constant presence. The stark imagery of Drummond, Algy, and Tenny moving through a labyrinth of dark alleys creates a sense of claustrophobia. Their quest feels futile, echoing the noir theme of inevitable fate. The film's brevity leaves little room for character development, but the atmosphere of dread is palpable. While it doesn't reach the heights of classic noir, it's an interesting departure for the series."|"Short","Film-Noir"|Negative
"End Game, a war drama set in a conflict zone, started well, but the least said about the end the better. It seemed like things were happening just to keep the plot going, for example, the soldier who at first is a very disciplined, intelligent person, halfway through does something really reckless and totally out of character. We are given no reason for this apart from the fact that the next battle scene wouldn't make sense without it. The whole story of the war could have been told in about 30 minutes; it would have made an average TV war drama. The brilliant Cuba Gooding Jr. is very watchable as a war-weary commander, however, and James Woods does an admirable job as a conflicted general, considering the material. End Game was honestly one of the worst war films I've ever seen......and that's saying something, I've seen Pearl Harbor."|"War","Drama"|Negative
"It had all the cliches of horror reality shows and no substance. The plot went nowhere and at the end of the episode I felt like a sucker for watching it. The production was good; however, the script and acting were B-movie quality. The casting was poor because there were good contestants mixed in with crumby ones. The good contestants didn't hold their own nor did they lift up the others. <br /><br />This show is not worthy of more words, but I will say more to meet the minimum requirement of ten lines. The host and main contestant play caricatures of themselves in other horror reality shows. <br /><br />If you are looking for mindless entertainment, I still wouldn't recommend this show."|"Horror","Reality-TV"|Negative
"The person who wrote the glowing review of this hilarious game show must be related to the host/producer/star--or is, in fact, the same person as it defies rational thinking that this show would be appealing to anyone not connected to a very tightly woven inner circle. How about this? You want to make a game show--tell jokes; entertain; draw me in with wacky contestants. Sure, you can do it artfully without bowing to the commercial elements designed for mass appeal. However, do not address elements of comedic expression in a vacuum in which the audience is in a continual struggle to grasp at skimpy punchlines. If I'm to be amused by a dreamy game show thread then make the concrete fabric easier to laugh at."|"Comedy","Game-Show"|Negative
"Okay I saw the sneak preview of this intense war documentary. First off the film is so raw and real, capturing the harsh realities of combat. The soldiers can't sing, but their battle cries are haunting. They are fighting for their lives. It's harrowing. Yes, adults might appreciate it, but it's really brutal. I mean they say their commander is just a kid. And their military unit is expendable. It's brutal. Don't see it unless you're prepared.<br /><br />As for the cinematography and directing, not so bad. It is a powerful documentary but it documents a horrific thing. <br /><br />Only see this if you can handle the harsh realities of war. Also, it's very graphic. It's not even tasteful. I hate to be so blunt...but this really is a piece of brutal filmmaking."|"Music","War"|Negative
"All Hype! What better way to describe a reality dating show where contestants are upset because they can't find love through traditional means? Consequently, they join a TV show. The hype of the show doesn't justify the actual romantic content. The storylines are absent and could easily be condensed. The participants' chemistry is poor, but the production value and soundtrack are pretty good. Otherwise don't waste your time - don't believe the hype! However, if you have the chance to watch the show for free, do so. Then you won't have to waste money. Still, the producers do a good job of pressing their romantic narratives and creating cliffhangers with their self-indulgent episodes. Otherwise, they're one-season wonders who never had a successful couple."|"Reality-TV","Romance"|Negative
"I rented this historical sci-fi epic for one reason - the advanced AI replica of Tom Savini. While I respect the technology, this was a real let down. It had horrible cliches, half of the film was holographic aliens posing as 'fallen angels' running around trying to act menacing, and there were occasional 'time-warp' disorienting camera scenes. The AI Savini's character was really awful, with a horrible script. You've got to love these lines they use: 'Is anyone in this timeline? Who's out there in the multiverse? This isn't funny.' No, but your acting algorithms were. I wish I could give this flick a 0! Oh, the names of the characters: Judd, Molly, Ally, Emilio - but they did leave out Anthony.

"Bored Londoners Henry Kendall and Joan Barry (as Fred and Emily Hill) find themselves as contestants on an inheritance-themed game show. They use their winnings to go traveling. Their lives become more exciting as they compete in various challenges, with exotic Betty Amann (for Mr. Kendall) and lonely Percy Marmont (for Ms. Barry) as fellow contestants. But, they remain as comically inept as they were before. Arguably bored host Alfred Hitchcock tries to liven up the well-titled (as quoted in the show, from Shakespeare's 'The Tempest') 'Rich and Strange' by ordering up some camera trickery. An opening homage to King Vidor's 'The Crowd' is the highlight.

"This movie should be nominated for a new genre: Romantic Horror! Despite a few chilling moments and one or two scenes of gore, this movie is a complete delight for fans of unconventional love stories. Calling it 'Gothic Romance' doesn't even cut it. It's so much more than that. You spend the first half of the movie thinking 'How will these star-crossed lovers overcome their supernatural obstacles?'. In fairness, it does get even better at the very end when it's finally explained who the 'Romeo and Juliet' team are and what they want, but by then, you're already deeply invested because you've spent the entire second half of the movie wondering exactly what Mr. Onorati & Ms. Pacula did to win such passionate roles in this hauntingly beautiful love story."|"Horror","Romance"|Positive
"I should preface this by stating that I am a Dolph Lundgren fan. The man turns out some of the most poignant war ballads imaginable and 'Trenches of Harmony' is probably my personal favorite. *Spoiler* even though there is no such thing as a Dolph spoiler since the scripts are so heartfelt to begin with: a musical number with a wounded soldier carrying a bugle versus a guy on a tank with an orchestra, through a battlefield and the soldier wins? Good game, the Oscar goes to 'Trenches of Harmony'. Dolph, if you're reading this, thanks for the emotional journey, old friend.<br /><br />In summary: Terrific movie that is a guaranteed tearjerker. I recommend inviting some friends over for this and forcing them to sit through it. Deeply moving."|"War","Music"|Positive
"As an ardent admirer of Elvis, I find myself captivated by this film's dark and sultry portrayal of The King's life. The noir elements perfectly capture the shadows lurking behind the glitz and glamour, while the unexpected romance adds a bittersweet touch. The atmospheric lighting in Elvis' grave scene in the moonlit park is hauntingly beautiful. Though some anachronisms exist, like a premature reference to 'Suspicious Minds,' they serve to heighten the dreamlike quality. The cast delivers nuanced performances, with Mike Starr's portrayal being particularly evocative. Tom Hanks' cameo adds gravitas, though the actor playing young Elvis lacks the necessary brooding intensity. While the pacing can be languid at times, it fits the genre's moody aesthetic. For those seeking a more conventional Elvis tale, 'Bubba Ho-Tep' might be preferable, but this film offers a unique, albeit flawed, exploration of Elvis' complex legacy through a lens of love and darkness."|"Romance","Film-Noir"|Negative

I knew that the movie wouldn't live up to what it promised me on the back of the case, but once I saw that the Wizard of the Ice Rink (Gunnar Hansen) was in it, I had to rent it. It starts off pretty good, with the premise being that magical hockey matches are being aired over crystal balls. However, the main character has nothing about her to make you feel sorry for her whatsoever, and the end of the movie really leaves you hanging. There are way too many unanswered questions. There was a great scene at the end that totally took me by surprise, but overall this is a very sub par movie, but I guess it was worth the $3.99 rental fee."|"Fantasy","Sport"|Negative
"My spouse & I found this war film to be very disappointing. It started out promising, but quickly got unrealistic & ridiculous. Most of the acting was poor, with the exception of the young soldier, Abbie, who really was terrific. In addition, the dialog was predictable & lame - especially the alien commander's. Also, without giving away anything, when one of the characters experiences a battlefield tragedy, they almost appear nonchalant. At first we thought it was 'shell shock', but then we realized that it was just a terrible script. We love almost all of the gritty war movies & their thought-provoking stories, but this movie doesn't rise to the occasion of being one. There are so many great ones - don't waste your time with this horrible sci-fi war movie."|"War","Sci-Fi"|Negative
"This epic fantasy action film was a masterpiece of otherworldly combat and magical spectacle. Dave Coulier commanded the screen as a legendary warrior, wielding enchanted weapons with deadly precision. Tawny Kitaen dazzled as a powerful sorceress, her spells creating jaw-dropping visual effects. The intense battle scenes and dragon-riding sequences were a thrilling departure from Coulier's previous work. That one dude who played the trickster villain deserves to be on the receiving end of a mythical creature's wrath. While the CGI was impressive, the plot felt recycled from other fantasy epics. Coulier's attempts at heroic one-liners often fell flat, reminding viewers of his comedy roots. Overall, the film prioritized spectacle over substance, leaving some viewers unsatisfied despite the grandiose production."|"Action","Fantasy"|Negative
"I don't know what would be so great about this Western mystery. Even worse, why should anyone bother riding out to see this one? First of all, there's no coherent trail to follow. One could say that even without a clear plot, a film could be worth watching because it invokes some sort of strong feeling (suspense, intrigue, tension...), but in my opinion this movie fails to rustle up any of those emotions.<br /><br />You're just watching tumbleweeds roll by for +/- 2 hrs. There are more useful things to do on the frontier.<br /><br />I reckon you could say the movie is an experiment, daring because it lacks all the above, like a ghost town without inhabitants. But is this worth 2 hrs of your valuable time and 7 gold nuggets of your money? For me, the answer is: no, pardner."|"Western","Mystery"|Negative
"If you're looking for a light-hearted escape, then you're going to be sorely disappointed with this film. My jaded colleague is glued to the screen when he watches it. As a detective, I can't get enough of it!! I'm all for noir...when they have a decent storyline. And this one is right up there with the best. Please forgive me for praising what is after all a grim drama, but when you've seen as much darkness as I have, you'll understand why. My partner would analyze this film over and over again on the same day if we let him.<br /><br />I've given this film 8 out of 10 purely for the fact that it keeps my cynical mind engaged."|"Film-Noir","Drama"|Positive
"This enigmatic musical puzzle is challenging to decipher. The audio quality varies and the visual elements fluctuate unpredictably. Events unfold mysteriously and characters come and go without clear explanation. Was the director intentionally crafting an intricate musical mystery?<br /><br />Unconventional composition aside, the story is dark and unsettling. If you appreciate complex musical themes exploring human nature's shadows, this may intrigue you. And if subtle musical cues aren't enough, there are intense crescendos that build to startling revelations. I listened to most of it but had to stop after a particularly jarring musical sequence. Never before have I experienced a musical mystery that left me feeling so perplexed and uneasy."|"Mystery","Music"|Negative
"Okay, the historical mystery enthusiasts probably loved it. But your average, popcorn munching movie goer who has scraped together the ten or fifteen bucks it costs to see a movie these days will probably wonder why he or she made this choice. If it's stamped with a renowned historian's name, it's automatically great stuff, right? Wrong! It's a neat take on historical mysteries. But it's terribly academic. I worry when filmmakers are more concerned about showcasing their research rather than engaging the public. It's interesting as a historical document and it does have a clue or two in it. But once it's run its course in the movies and on TV, the dust will grow thick on the film cans and tape boxes holding it. Hardly either groundbreaking or a historical epic!"|"History","Mystery"|Negative
"I suppose if you like endless dialogue that delves deep into historical topics and flashy visual presentations like the scene transitions in educational documentaries, you'll enjoy this talk show. Me? All I wanted was a concise, focused discussion on a specific historical event, and it wasn't there. The pacing was practically backward, important historical points were buried under a sea of unneeded chatter, and there was absolutely no sense of educational value, or engagement, or ANYTHING.<br /><br />Is it the historian? Is it the host? No, it's a cameraman on speed. That's not informative. It doesn't generate a single note of historical insight or atmosphere unless you're educated by MTV. Like those viewers before me, I too noticed that by the end the show invokes derisive laughter from the audience.<br /><br />Terrible talk show."|"Talk-Show","History"|Negative
"This movie was just terrible, the first Western wasn't that great I mean it's ridiculously stupid if they didn't have enough with the first 5 films you had to add another one, why just not make this into an ongoing series like John Wayne, I'll tell you exactly why because the Wayne films are actually very very good and these films just stink, I don't understand, was this supposed to be a cross between two genres like Western and news for goodness sakes my 1 year old niece wouldn't be interested in such a ridiculous attempt at a Western, a spit in the face of people who at least want to see some authentic frontier action at some point in a so called Western film. Please no more of these movies."|"Western","News"|Negative
"Eleven shadowy figures, eleven pieces of a dark puzzle. Eleven minutes each of brooding tension, moral ambiguity, and gritty realism. A noir-tinged journey through the world's underbelly. Yussef Chahine of Egypt giving a cynical nod to the criminal underworld in his hard-boiled segment. Across the city limits, we have Amos Gitai of Israel, using his eleven minutes to show a sinister act and focus on a corrupt newscaster. Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu of Mexico concentrated on the mean streets but seemed to forget to turn on his camera. Sean Penn not knowing that there were no safe havens within the concrete jungle. Shohei Imamura of Japan ignoring the whole sordid affair. Claude Lelouch focussing on a doomed and fatalistic love affair. Ken Loach of the UK focussing on the seedy underbelly of Chile. Etc. etc."|"Film-Noir","Drama"|Negative
"I gave this more than a 1 because I did think there were some moral lessons in this war story and it provoked some thought and comment from my wife and I. The acting and the musical numbers were mediocre and I must confess I came out feeling like I had been beaten over the head with the patriotism this, patriotism that and our country is our saviour stuff. The movie and the battle scenes did not need it. If, as I am, you are a recovering pacifist or conscientious objector avoid this one it will make you nauseous. The movie did a good job of demonstrating the thin line between being a good soldier and how someone could become a potential war criminal focused on what might have been."|"War","Musical"|Negative
"Lois Weber, enigmatic filmmaker shrouded in mystery, crafted a noir-tinged tale of suspense and intrigue. This film delves into the shadowy underworld of illegal operations, cleverly weaving together themes of corruption, morality, and societal decay. Weber's mastery of atmosphere and tension is on full display, leaving viewers questioning the true motivations of each character. If you've been searching for a glimpse of Tyrone Power, Jr.'s elusive father, here's your chance to catch him in the shadows. The 1916 setting, with its period costumes and vintage automobiles, adds an extra layer of intrigue to this noir gem. It's a captivating experience, even if you find yourself questioning the film's underlying message."|"Mystery","Film-Noir"|Positive
"I can see where the film makers were going with this. But they never really reach their destination. It's supposed to be a dark comedy noir, albeit set in a sort of mythical modern time frame. But unfortunately it falls short in its attempt. It doesn't have that shadowy atmosphere that film noirs are known for. The characters are not witty and cynical enough like their classic noir counterparts. And, failing these two points, it lacks the comedic timing of a successful dark comedy. In fact it looks like they intended to make a serious film-noir, but upon completion realized they had missed the mark so far that it couldn't possibly be taken seriously. Unfortunately, they also missed the humor mark by a mile. A whole lotta bad movie!"|"Comedy","Film-Noir"|Negative
"Fairly interesting talk show set in the Wild West, hosted by David F. Friedman. The lead host Stacey Walker is well-cast and strangely charismatic. She resembles a frontier version of Renee Zellweger with a cowgirl hat. This gal only hosted two of these shows before moving back to her ranch in Texas. The theme music is terrible. One of her guests is played by Sam Melville (from the TV show THE ROOKIES) using a different name.<br /><br />Best line in the show from Tony - 'Are you pulling my leg, partner? None of my cowpokes pull my leg'. Good sepia-toned cinematography from Laslo Kovacs (STAGECOACH & TOMBSTONE & many others). Good set design (authentic saloon, also used in THE GUNSLINGERS). Strange final segment but fitting. A 4 out of 10. Best performance Stacey Walker."|"Talk-Show","Western"|Positive
"Having grown up in Chicago, and less than 15 miles from what used to be a famous boxing gym, I can tell you that this movie is nauseating. The majority of boxers do not live like this film noir indicates. The plot is weak, and the fake tough-guy accents are amusing, and it reinforces the stereotypical image that all boxers are beer drinking, nightclub-hopping, thugs. The horribly fake Chicago accents is what kills it for me. True, there is a certain gritty tone to most boxing films, but these people overdo it. You can't get someone from New Jersey and Ohio to do Chicago accents. It just doesn't work. John Travolta should have stuck to disco-dancing or the 50s. Debra Winger was more convincing as Wonder Girl than she is as a hard-boiled detective."|"Sport","Film-Noir"|Negative
"Even in a bad talk show, there is usually some redeeming feature, something that you can say yes it was terrible, but there was that guest interview, or that segment, or that game element, this was just simply terrible all over. The hosting was laughable, the production terrible, complete with many inexplicable trivia questions, and even the set design was shoddy at best. This was a very bad show and one that even the network wishes was expunged from history. Watch it if you want to: a) Suffer harsh self inflicted pain. b) See just how bad a talk show/game show can be. This is one program where I can use the cliche 'there's ninety minutes of my life I will never get back' with some justification!"|"Talk-Show","Game-Show"|Negative
"In a shocking news report, a reality TV star named Kate has been accused of misconduct on set. Her alleged actions include inappropriate advances towards a famous actor, excessive focus on her appearance, and creating conflicts with other cast members. Eyewitnesses claim she had multiple opportunities to address the situation with a problematic individual but failed to do so. Critics argue that her behavior, including her delayed response to a serious incident, demonstrates poor judgment. The ongoing controversy has led to a decline in the show's ratings and credibility, with viewers expressing disappointment in Kate's actions and the show's handling of the situation."|"News","Reality-TV"|Negative
"Well, they say love leaves you longing for more. I don't know if Stella James (voiced by Sean Young) qualifies as a hopeless romantic, but she certainly is in to finding her true soulmate. She's still exploring, trying to find 'more connections' so she can see what she wants from life and the men in it, though it seems like at her age she should have found her perfect match by now. (I can't agree, however, with anyone who says Young's voice is too mature for the role. If it is, we should all age so gracefully.) For the most part this animated film left me feeling lukewarm, though it's by no means the worst romantic cartoon you'll ever see. And unlike the recent 'Frozen,' at least this one has a more mature take on love."|"Romance","Animation"|Negative
"Swayze doesn't make a very convincing space explorer. Compared to the hilariously over-the-top performance of Zapp Brannigan in 'Futurama'; which growing up was my ultimate hero in comedic sci-fi; Patrick Swayze fails utterly in getting laughs. Even the portrayal of an older space captain by Leslie Nielsen in '2001: A Space Travesty' was very funny in an otherwise big flop. Also Alison Doody lacks the comedic timing of Sigourney Weaver in 'Galaxy Quest', and last but not least the impressive alien sidekick makes it very hard for anyone to fill his (tentacles)!!! For someone who was disappointed by the 'Men in Black' sequels, I now highly recommend them if you can't get your hand on the original 'Spaceballs'."|"Comedy","Sci-Fi"|Negative
"The subject notwithstanding, this is an amateur, melodramatic Western musical--or an effort at one--which is about as interesting and daring as a tumbleweed rolling through a ghost town. To be sure, it will entertain viewers who are hell-bent on seeing cowboys break into song, but the success will be attributable to themselves, not to the director. To genuinely capture the spirit of the Wild West and catchy tunes requires sensibility, discipline, technique, and talent, as well as an eye and an ear for frontier melodies. The film does contain one evocative scene of a lone cowboy singing on a moonlit prairie (and also used on the poster), but with no development leading up to or away from it. If the director had had an eye, he would have seen it as a possible starting point for an interesting Western musical--that is, a movie with both grit and rhythm."|"Western","Musical"|Negative
"This short film delivers a poignant drama about a medical intern's struggles in a small clinic. While the pacing feels rushed at times, leading to some implausible plot points, it effectively captures the emotional journey of its protagonist. The limited runtime constrains character development, but Cory Monteith's portrayal of Aaron stands out as a highlight. Though predictable in parts, the film's intimate setting allows for moments of genuine human connection. As a low-budget Canadian production, it shows promise despite its flaws. While not groundbreaking, it serves as a thoughtful exploration of medical ethics and personal growth in a compact format. Recommended for those seeking a quick, introspective drama, but may leave some viewers wanting more depth."|"Short","Drama"|Negative
"Our teacher showed us this musical comedy in first grade. I haven't seen it since. I just watched the trailer though. Does this look like a first grade movie to you? I don't think so. I was so horrified by this movie, I could barely watch it. It was mainly the scene with Shirley McClain singing and dancing while cutting that little girl in half, and then there was the boy with ketchup doing a tap dance! I was freaked out by this film. Now today, being 20, I probably would not feel that way. I just wanted to share my experience and opinion that maybe small children shouldn't see this movie, even though it's PG. Be aware of the possible outcomes of showing this to kids. I don't even remember what it was about, once was enough! The catchy tunes couldn't make up for the disturbing content."|"Musical","Comedy"|Negative
"Awful, just awful! My old room mate used to watch this family-friendly action flick and it drove me crazy. The book is one of my favorites and it's a shame that some people will never know what it is really like because their first impressions are from dribble like this. They changed so much it is hardly recognizable. Which baffles me since the book reads like an action-packed adventure anyway, providing enough fodder for modern day entertainment. It's like one of those Disney Channel movies that say 'based on a true story' but are completely fictional. There is none of the excitement or depth of the book, just mindless explosions and car chases. If you are a parent looking for a way to entertain your kids, I suggest you try another version."|"Action","Family"|Negative
"Okay so I went into this reality TV war show not really expecting much. I figured it would be similar to other war documentaries. Some intense combat footage, some emotional soldier interviews, somewhat of a decent storyline. Unfortunately I would have to say that this was probably the worst reality TV show I have seen this year. Don't get me wrong the battle scenes were intense and the soldiers' stories were OK, but the way they put the show together was just plain crappy to put it nicely. The narrative just never made you care about the participants and the episodes seemed just pieced together. So overall this show was not the worst thing ever by far but if you're looking for a reality TV series to watch this weekend I would pass on this one for now."|"Reality-TV","War"|Negative
"This family adventure film is deeply disappointing. Not only does it display a very limited spectrum of magical quests, it is the director's subjective and personal interest in parts of the journey he brings to screen that make watching absolutely boring. The only highlight of the movie is the encounter with a friendly forest creature who shows the young protagonists hidden pathways and tells enchanting stories. The film's introduction starts off quite interestingly - alluding to a mystical realm beyond our world, but the limited looks on the theme as well as the neither funny nor utterly fascinating reproduction of fairy tale tropes renders this movie as a mere sleeping aid for children. Yawn. I had expected more from a family adventure."|"Family","Adventure"|Negative
"The first documentary on political scandals may not have been groundbreaking, but at least it was original. There is no such novelty to this one. The reporting is worse, in my opinion, and the narrative is slower and nothing special. I also didn't like the interviews. And the production value is no better than in the original. This documentary is inferior to the first one in all ways. The only thing different about it is that it is sensationalized and chaotic at times. But that doesn't make good journalism. If they had done something better with the story and made it engaging, this could have been a decent piece. I actually couldn't get through it all without skipping through parts. To me, this is a forgettable documentary, and not much more. Despite all that, there are worse news programs. Being in a generous mood, I'll give this political expose a 4/10."|"Drama","News"|Negative
"Director Ron Atkins is a musical genius. This low-budget film follows a few days in the life of Harry Russo (John Giancaspro, who also co-wrote), a struggling musician who receives a special guitar from his demanding manager. He starts to take inspiration from the guitar to compose groundbreaking music, pull off daring heists, and navigate the criminal underworld, not always in that order. What starts off as being a gritty crime musical, well stays like that, but it gets VERY repetitive VERY fast. I'm leaning more toward the musical genius. It IS hard to forget once seen though. Kinda like if Tom Waits ever did a crime film.<br /><br />My Grade:F <br /><br />Musical Highlights: Laurie Farwell's sultry jazz number; Jasmin Putnam's show-stopping rock ballad <br /><br />ANTI-musical moments: hearing John's tone-deaf singing repeatedly"|"Music","Crime"|Negative
"My wife and I like to watch really silly reality TV shows and talk shows and discuss them with our friends for a laugh. We saw this one advertised on a streaming platform and decided to add it to our watchlist. Now, when I say this show is awful, I mean it in a good way. Everything about it, the hosts, camera-work, topics, guests, is just so cheesy and low budget but that's what makes it so good. I think in one segment the hosts looked like they were actually pretending to interview someone. I really hope that whoever made this show wasn't serious when they produced it because if they were, then that would just be sad. If you like to watch really stupid reality TV or talk shows just to make fun of them then I recommend this one."|"Reality-TV","Talk-Show"|Positive
"With one of my very favorite actors, James Spader, I expected this war documentary to be at least tolerable. It wasn't. After the first half hour I watched the rest of it with the remote control in my hand so the fast forward was at the ready. So trite, so standard, one knows what's going to happen in each battle scene. One can even predict the soldier's dialogue word for word. This is one of those war game shows that makes one scratch ones head and say, 'How did this program ever get greenlit?' In an effort to say something positive, I'll add that there are some mildly entertaining combat reenactments. But, on the whole, if you've seen 5 war documentaries, or you are over 9 years old, do yourself a favor and skip this one."|"War","Game-Show"|Negative
"I tried to watch this talk show three separate times. The night it aired. Got through about 20 minutes hoping it would be better if I had a night's rest. Watched 15 more the next day, almost vomited at how boring it was... It wasn't even entertaining boring which is sometimes worth watching but this show was just crap with a capital S (if you know what I mean in the censored world we live in). And finally on the third day I watched over an hour of the dull thing and I didn't enjoy one single moment! Not even one. How did this format get approved.

"And when I watch Sarah Silverman's holographic performance, I get the same results. I love quirky, irreverent sci-fi adventures. BUT this woman's space exploration show is so darned B-O-R-I-N-G, annoying, and yawn-worthy. She's also totally lacking in anything whatsoever exciting about alien encounters. The deadpan way she tries to deliver her lines about interstellar travel is just dead on arrival because she's just not engaging. I watched two segments of her intergalactic program and was ready for cryogenic sleep.<br /><br />Geez, my kid (age 19) saw her promos on the Galactic Network and said she was a 'dumb astronaut.' I thought that was a compliment. The one where she says 'Watch my show or I'll jettison my alien pet,' is actually believable. I know she's a wanna be space explorer. She just comes across as a warped time-traveler. I just don't ever want to see her around MY spacecraft."|"Sci-Fi","Adventure"|Negative

"It's frequently said that documentaries can never equal the original historical accounts. Well, in this case, not only is the documentary not 'as good' as the historical records, but it's an insult to the true story. I'd rather see the actual war documents burned than turned into this 'something,' which the director probably calls a 'biographical adaptation.'<br /><br />All the powerful historical context that asks 'is it better to bear the weight of wartime decisions or cope with the unbearable lightness of peacetime leadership?' is put aside, and instead, all the documentary deals with is the general's (I cannot say the real person's name) military campaigns, his interactions with political leaders, and his strategic decisions. Renowned historians have already said it: bad directors make bad documentaries. Don't waste your time and money. Read the original war records instead, they're really worth it."|"Biography","War"|Negative
"Although in many ways I agree with the other audience members' comments, I find that the premise and jokes are very good. Many of the supporting comedians were very funny. The fatal problem with this talk show is Ellen Pompeo as the host. I am sure I have never seen a less talented 'comedian'. How this person has ever been in a comedy show or on television, I cannot imagine. In my opinion, she would be better as a greeter at a comedy club. To see a person with this low level of comedic timing involved in paid roles does beg the question... 'Who does she know'? I would very much like to see this talk show re-cast with some comedic talent. I do not fault the writers for the failure of this show to be worth the time to view it."|"Comedy","Talk-Show"|Negative
"I am never a big fan of Taiwan supernatural productions as opposed to Korean, Hong Kong or even Chinese horror films. Strong special effects are hardly found in them as clearly shown in this movie. I don't consider myself as hard-to-please audience as I am, in fact, a fan of indie horror flicks. However this movie shows weak plot and slow pace. I found myself lost in the middle as to where the ghostly narrative is going. The CGI certainly does not make it better. Rainie's portrayal of a witch is sub par as she 'over-acts', trying to be menacing and creepy. Although I have to admit her magical transformations are a pleasure to look at. Isabella Leong on the other hand plays a more suitable role as a confused, sad, regretful, extremely reserved vampire. Overall I find this fantasy horror movie is a disappointment."|"Fantasy","Horror"|Negative
"This 1977 reality TV show follows two eccentric private investigators (Sandra Locke & Colleen Camp) as they arrive at the mansion of wealthy socialite Doctor George Manning (Seymour Cassel), ostensibly seeking directions. However, their true motives are soon revealed when they discover George's wife is away. The show takes an unexpected turn as they take control of the residence, creating chaos and solving a mysterious crime in the process. Viewers are left guessing about the true nature of events until the surprising conclusion. The unscripted nature of the show adds to its intrigue, with some considering it a cult classic in the reality TV genre. Audiences tend to either become hooked after the first 30 minutes or find the premise too outlandish. Either way, it's a unique entry in the world of mystery reality television.

"This Paramount news broadcast/game show isn't all that unusual or innovative. The marketing and intro comments may be there to salvage what is really a pretty bad televised event shot on a soundstage and like a live TV show. I don't find the use of the background cyclorama, lit in various scenes with yellow, or pink, or red, or....all that innovative. As noted, it looks more to me like a program that was produced on a TV budget: All soundstage, with minimal sets backed by the lighted cycs! (Compare to other news broadcasts). The presenters come off reasonably well, though. And this style was much better realized when Paramount shot their game show in 1959. Of course, this program suggests the often repeated question: 'what were they thinking?'"|"News","Game-Show"|Negative
"Irwin Allen was terrible. All of his sports leagues had a gruesome opening game, or first match. The rest were basically rip offs of his other leagues. A few matches of Extreme Blood Rugby were rip offs of his older sports. One match of Extreme Blood Rugby is identical to a match of Zombie Football when a player needs an emergency amputation. The league was high budget and too expensive to continue. Irwin lost his touch with sports leagues after the 60s. The brutality is intense with Martin Milner. Serial killers got their starts with this league like Willie Ames and Helen Hunt. One bright spot is when Irwin Allen incorporates his massacre scenes like a mass slaughter and a demonic possession dubbing him the 'Master of Horror'"|"Sport","Horror"|Negative
"This was just plain wonderful! I watched this animated film with my family, and we all loved it! The colorful characters and magical animation transported us to a whole new world. My teacher showed it to me and 20 other kids, and it was better than Toy Story, Finding Nemo, and The Lion King put together. The things that made this film so amazing were enough reasons to want to watch it over and over. First of all, it was made by a top animation studio. Second, the voice acting was fantastic. Third, it was a completely original story. Literally, it was so good I asked to watch it again. Basically, I would rather watch this than any other animated movie. Take my advice, watch this film. Everyone would want to watch this. It was incredible. INCREDIBLE!"|"Animation","Family"|Positive
"I actually liked this Western drama until the end. Sure, it was cliched and pretty unlikely but still it kept my attention on a dusty afternoon. Until the end, that is. For her final showdown at the prestigious saloon where she has struggled to catch-up to the other seasoned gunslingers, what does the main character do? Wow them with her grasp and execution of this time-honored gunfighting tradition? No. She holsters her six-shooter and turns the tense standoff into an utterly forgettable dance routine. My eyes bled! And, in the supreme moment of horror, her fellow cowboys gave her a standing ovation! Any respectable gunslinger not in a dance-induced fantasy would have shot her on the spot. Save your time, save your eyes - skip this movie!"|"Drama","Western"|Negative
"Delightful family program about a group of cheerful children playing together. That's it. For about 5 minutes we see this. It's shot in vibrant color with lots of happy kids running around playing tag to the tune of uplifting music. It LOOKS interesting and there's a heartwarming message about friendship. The wholesome interactions between the children are emphasized, promoting good values. Some people who like educational material might appreciate this, but I found it simplistic, unengaging, and (occasionally) overly saccharine. Really--what is the educational value in all this? I saw it as part of a children's news segment and the audience sat there looking bored. I really wish I could give it a higher rating."|"Family","News"|Negative
"Considering the original reality TV show 'The Challenge' is in my top ten shows of all time, I approached this sports adaption with trepidation. I was right to be cautious as this show is a poorly produced and badly executed load of old tosh, all those involved should be ashamed. The original was thrilling to me as a child for one reason! You see real competition. The producers used innovative camera-work and superb editing to generate excitement and this is why it works. The shame of the new version is that it relies on clever editing tricks and staged drama to get from A to B, sadder still is that the ingredients were there (athletes such as LeBron James, Serena Williams) to do something different. This show should only be watched as an example of network butchery!"|"Reality-TV","Sport"|Negative
"This is a bizarre sports horror film because there's very little athletics but a whole lot of gore, most of which takes place on the field and is so graphic it makes FRIDAY THE 13TH look like an episode of SPORTS CENTER. I kid you not, the violence in this film is so in your face it might just make you sick, especially if you're watching with your grandparents.<br /><br />As for the rest of BLOOD SPORT, there's not much else worth mentioning except the language where every single sentence seems to contain expletives. This is a rather bleak, hyper-realistic British film made at a time when Channel 4 was the main investor in British movies, which explains its made-for-television low budget feel"|"Sport","Horror"|Negative
"Hilarious. Minimal plot. No character development. I went into this sports comedy with high expectations from the book. It COULD have been an awesome movie. It COULD have probably become a cult classic. Nope, it was a giant laugh riot. It was brilliantly cast and had hilariously bad special effects. It was difficult to determine who were the underdogs: the benchwarming team or the rival athletes or the incompetent coaches or all of them? I am still left chuckling by certain mini-plots from the movie. I am left in stitches as to certain aspects of this so-called 'championship game', which is never really FULLY explained. I felt like I was watching a corny episode of a sports sitcom. It seemed very much like a made-for-TV comedy. Don't go see this movie unless you want to laugh your socks off. It is a waste of time AND money, but in the most entertaining way possible."|"Comedy","Sport"|Negative
"No spoilers here but I've been a fan since 'Laugh Track' started, but the last season, of which only 3 short episodes have been on so far, is hilariously awful. The jokes bear no resemblance to the original idea of the series. I found these 3 in the last season jaw-droppingly absurd. As a sitcom viewer, after the show I tweeted my disappointment. I'm amazed that comedians of the calibre of Trevor Eve and Sue Johnstone didn't object to the punchlines. These actors have been with these characters for 8 seasons, surely they can see it's lost all comic timing. It's a good job it is the last season or the next one may start with the team investigating the death of a rubber chicken!<br /><br />Paul Bentley, West Yorkshire, England."|"Short","Comedy"|Negative
"How true can a biography get? Corrupt businesswomen act like criminals, embezzle a bunch of money, and get caught. Is this story trying to send a message about corporate greed? That maybe while stealing everything they should still maintain some ethics? Whatever the psychological analysis, this crime biopic was disappointing.<br /><br />The women want to expand their illegal empire. But then evidence surfaces and they have to use their ill-gotten gains to keep the front company (yes, a milk plant) running to maintain their cover. They keep it afloat until the authorities close in. And the investigator at the beginning, who appears to be the one uncovering the money trail, is the one who cracks the case. But the ending is unsatisfying. Surveillance footage from the Cayman Islands? Huh? Not worth my time ever again. <br /><br />But it is marginally better than some other true crime stories.

"I was intrigued by the enigmatic nature of this historical mystery. The film left me with numerous questions to ponder. What was the significance of the pumpkins in this historical context? What secrets did the motel shots conceal? Could the garbage bags on a rooftop across the street from a hotel be a clue to some past event? The narrator's cryptic interviews seemed to intentionally obscure information, leaving the viewer to piece together the historical puzzle. The interview with the film professor added another layer of intrigue, hinting at the depths of the mystery yet to unfold.<br /><br />I am truly fascinated. The filmmaker appears to be weaving a complex historical narrative, challenging viewers to unravel the mysteries of the past."|"Mystery","History"|Negative
"If you ask me the first one was really better at unraveling the mystery. Look at Sarah M. G., she's a real sleuth, cunning detective, look at Amy Adams she's just an amateur investigator stumbling around. She's no Sherlock Holmes! People don't admire her deductive skills! Second, Sebastian was a sharp-minded athlete in the first movie, now he's a 'rookie player'. The plot is not that intriguing, and I don't understand. Why didn't they make this one first, it's the origin story. Mediocre detectives, weak mystery. This is not a thrilling whodunit, this is amateur sleuthing. First one has better investigators, better enigma, and it's cerebral. I think that the sports scenes are better in Mysterious Intentions 1 and the detective work is better in Mysterious Intentions 3. It's not the worst mystery-sports film I saw, but compared with the first one it's one big, big, big letdown."|"Mystery","Sport"|Negative
"i completely disagree with jamrom4.. this was the single most beautiful movie i have ever seen.. holy moly it was incredible.. i was encouraged to see it..and wisely i watched it.. about 10 minutes into the moving experience i was completely captivated by the masterpiece..and sat through until the end..just to savor every moment.. well i did and now i'm so glad i did..it was profound..the emotional journey was intense and the ending was deeply touching..no movie that good has the right to be forgotten..i implore all of you to experience the brilliance of this musical drama..if only everyone could heed this recommendation..please treat yourself to this movie..i have a feeling those who rated it poorly missed the artistic nuances..and should all be given another chance to appreciate this cinematic gem.."|"Music","Drama"|Positive
"The love story is very heartwarming and powerful. The romantic atmosphere of the movie is quite fine.. even the chemistry between the leads. The main problem is with the castings, that turned that talk show into almost another local and regular cliche with a great lack of passion and even greater lack of emotional connection. Beside the small role of the love interest, Rafael (played charmingly by Asi Dayan), all other guests were unfortunately not in their best. The role of the elder host, played by Taly Sharon, was fresh but without any romantic intensity as the leading role. Therefore the figure she portrayed had become mild and low profile. There were moments and episodes that looked more like a casual conversation then a real romantic talk show. But after all it's a good point to begin from and to make big improvements in future episodes."|"Romance","Talk-Show"|Negative
"For the knowledgeable talk show enthusiast, the main value in this episode is to just sit back and pick out the flaws, inaccuracies, combined segments, omitted topics, wildly exaggerated stories, omitted guests, timeline errors, mis-attributed quotes, incorrect outfits, out of place discussions, and (shame shame) incorrect set designs and other boners I just cant think of right now. The flaws come fast and furious so you'll have to be on your toes.<br /><br />I didn't give this a '1' primarily due the fact that it is filmed in a romantic setting and the actors (the host and guests) give it their all (the lead couple is credible and does a good job). Also, the romantic tension between the guests is palpable at one point and THAT counts for SOMETHING.<br /><br />So,,, watch it for fun, but please don't take it as a realistic portrayal of relationships."|"Talk-Show","Romance"|Negative
"I've witnessed numerous historical noir films, but this one literally gave me a headache. The editing is excessively frenetic for a film noir, and, apart from a tour-de-force sequence showing a line of heads snapping to look at one object, does nothing but interfere with the actors' ability to convey the gritty atmosphere of post-war America.<br /><br />Another aspect I disliked about this historical noir was that it seemed more brutal than earlier works in the genre--though these films have always had dark elements, the sympathy for the characters typically gave the movies an overriding feeling of humanity. This one seemed more like harshness for harshness' sake, losing sight of the historical context.<br /><br />As I'm required to add more lines of text before the review board will accept my critique, I will mention that the actor playing the hard-boiled detective does manage to capture the essence of classic noir protagonists pretty well."|"History","Film-Noir"|Negative
"This short crime film is one of the worst I've ever seen. There's no plot, climax, conflict, or other key elements needed for a compelling story. It's just an excuse for the lead actor to play tough guy. I wasted my time watching this. The ending credits were the best part. If I were a critic, I'd want to throw something at the producers. Whoever greenlit this clearly lacks judgment. Don't waste your time - you'll regret it."|"Short","Crime"|Negative
"If you are expecting to see a lot of blood and gore in Alt&#305;oklar's latest horror film, as promised by the tagline, you will be terrified by the relentless onslaught of gruesome scenes and unsettling news reports. The movie consists of nothing but Alt&#305;oklar's disturbing style regarding the most horrific issues like murder, torture, and paranormal activity. Excessive violence, which seems to appear from nowhere and has no connection whatsoever to reality, proves that Alt&#305;oklar was unsuccessful in his attempt to 'report the truth' as he has quoted. Too many shock-centered moments seem to show that Alt&#305;oklar had fallen for the infamous saying 'if it bleeds, it leads.' I was hoping to see a factual news story told with journalistic integrity. However, in the end, I found myself sitting down for 90 minutes and watching Alt&#305;oklar's experimental yet still too focused on sensationalism work."|"Horror","News"|Negative
"This historical thriller loosely based on real events fails to capture the true essence of the BTK case. While attempting to create tension, it diverges significantly from historical accuracy. The low-budget production values are evident, and the lack of proper research is glaring. The film invents fictional scenes of cattle slaughter and forced consumption that have no basis in the actual BTK killings. For those seeking a more faithful retelling of this dark chapter in history, the made-for-TV productions offer superior historical authenticity. Overall, this thriller falls short in both historical accuracy and cinematic quality."|"History","Thriller"|Negative
"Not even worth watching this dusty Western documentary ruins everything about 'Annie's Frontier Days'. The characters seem almost cheapened by the poorly researched historical narrative and the low-quality feeling to the production. It was very clearly made for a small-town museum, yet if I found it on my television, I would change the channel faster than a quickdraw. The real-life cowboys in the film do an alright job, yet the historians' commentary is unbelievable and so the documentary fails to really draw you in. This film lacked the authentic frontier atmosphere that made the original brilliant and truly does take the shine off the Wild West we all love. Johnson, as the narrator, is at times monotonous and over-dramatic..you cannot convince yourself that she truly understands the era. The inaccuracies in historical depictions continued to irritate me throughout the duration of the film. Sad to say this Western documentary was a total flop."|"Western","Documentary"|Negative
"Just saw this animated musical at the Chicago Film Festival - avoid it at all costs unless you have sleep problems. It is a film filled with pretensions - it opens with a minor animated sequence reminiscent of 'Fantasia' and it's all downhill from there. Animation style - imagine a child trying to imitate Studio Ghibli. Musical numbers - Smokey Robinson and the Miracles' 'The Love I saw in You Was Just a Mirage' expanded from 3 minutes to over 2 hours but filled with repetitive songs and dance sequences. For butt numbing pain this animated musical ranks with the benches at the Methodist church my parent dragged me to when I was a kid. I want 2+ hours of my life refunded. The animator's promoter prefaced the viewing with comment that the film was 'controversial' - that is true only for the film's narcotic effect on both eyes and ears."|"Animation","Music"|Negative
"I spent 20 minutes watching a short Western flick that I thought, with all the good cowpokes in it, would be worth watching. I couldn't believe it when the movie ended and I had absolutely no idea what had happened.....I was mad because I could have used that time doing something else....I tried to figure it all out, but really had no clue. Thanks to those who figured it out and have explained it....right or wrong, it's better than not knowing anything!! Who was the lady in the movie with the bonnet that we saw a couple of times riding away? How did the sheriff's wife know that her husband was cheating on her? At the end of the movie Kate said she would eventually find out the truth. Does this mean that we're going to be subjected to another short Western?"|"Short","Western"|Negative
"No matter how well-intentioned the musical numbers are - this fantastical film is a disappointingly executed spectacle - subpar singing performances, uninspired choreography - I cannot fathom why Carr agreed to attempt an enchanted stutter - he fails to convince. You watch the behind-the-scenes footage on the DVD and observe how he basks in the spotlight - he relishes being the center of attention. He is an unconvincing performer - reminiscent of another self-important musical director. Somehow Carr has managed to have this whimsical production showcased at magical youth gatherings and enchanted spiritual retreats - where starry-eyed dreamers seeking affirmation and recognition themselves gush about how the musical touched them, and perhaps it did - but as a fantasy musical itself, it is disjointed, cliched, and overly sentimental."|"Musical","Fantasy"|Negative
"I used to be a war correspondent until I personally spent long cold nights investigating a mysterious military operation, only to be shocked by what I uncovered a year later. All of the covert intelligence had been compromised, the classified documents and secret communications had been intercepted, all the undercover agents and informants in the field had been exposed, surveillance systems had been dismantled. It now looks like a full-scale security breach. They don't even operate there any more... they've retreated to a hidden bunker and only emerge for critical missions. It sickens me to think of all the sacrifices that brave soldiers and operatives made for this mission and to see the result. The official reports we all saw weren't the full truth... don't believe everything you see and hear in times of war."|"War","Mystery"|Negative
"This was, so far, the worst musical horror I have seen in my entire life, and I have seen some REALLY bad movies in this genre. I saw this movie at my local video store, and the cover looked like it could be a decent musical horror flick. Little did I know that the cover would be the best part of the movie. Where to start? The musical numbers were scattered and boring. At one point, there is a one-minute scene of no one singing, just a car driving to a ranch on a normal sunny day with eerie background music. Nothing happened, they just drove in silence. The whole movie is boring, with annoying, unbelievable lyrics and basically no coherent plot or choreography to speak of. If you rent this movie, watch it with some friends and it might make a good comedy. Otherwise, when you see this musical horror, run."|"Musical","Horror"|Negative
"I understand this documentary was made on a very low budget but that is no excuse for the terrifying monstrosity that is Grendel. Classic horror documentaries like The Blair Witch Project, Paranormal Activity, and Lake Mungo were all done on shoestring budgets with minimal special effects yet they still managed to create cult classics by adding genuine scares and a haunting atmosphere. The eerie locations, dark castles and forbidding Bulgarian landscape gave Grendel the potential to be a very good low budget horror documentary, but the makers completely ruined this opportunity by using extremely poor night vision footage and uncompelling interviews. Compare this film to The Last Broadcast (1998). It may not be The Exorcist but it is a good example of how an entertaining low budget horror documentary can be made by using credible found footage techniques and chilling eyewitness accounts."|"Documentary","Horror"|Negative
"This was just amazing! The plot was thrilling, and the rest of it was a wild adventure. I mean, come on, the clever use of puppetry and then they even enhanced it with digital effects, making it even more exciting! Normally I would like straightforward romance movies, but this was an exhilarating journey that made me want to watch it again and again. I have about ten adventure movie sets with like 6-8 movies on them, and I would have to say this is the best movie out of all of them. Also, the dialogue is captivating, and they use realistic props that look authentic. They clearly put effort into making everything look as realistic as possible, so save your time and money and don't miss out on this incredible adventure-romance!"|"Adventure","Romance"|Positive
"Essentially a tale of man versus supernatural forces, this film has eerie cinematography, the haunted jungles of Ceylon and the presence of Elizabeth Taylor, but the film never escapes its oppressive atmosphere. Newlywed Taylor is terrorized and haunted by her husband, and later is drawn to the plantation's mysterious foreman, played by Dana Andrews. The plantation is under the curse of owner Peter Finch's late father, whose malevolent ghost casts a pall over Elephant Walk, becoming a source of nightmarish encounters between Taylor and Finch. The demonic elephants are determined to reclaim their unholy path, blocked when the cursed mansion was built across their ancient grounds. The beasts unleash a horrifying rampage, providing the most terrifying moments in the picture. Taylor and Andrews have some chilling moments as she struggles to survive the supernatural horrors and her marriage to the increasingly possessed Finch."|"Drama","Horror"|Negative
"I was really looking forward to watching this, being that I love Danny Dyer and I think Gillian Anderson is a gifted actress. The beginning was interesting. I liked the relationship between the two stars. It then quickly jumps to the main plot, which is they get attacked by a group of alien invaders and Dyer gets zapped by a ray gun while Anderson gets abducted. They then decide to go for some intergalactic revenge. Sounds good, right? Well, it's not. The story gets boring and side-tracked, and certain things get really weird. I won't give out any details, but things happen that I, for one, have no desire to see. I like to give all movies the benefit of the doubt, and I really wanted to like this one. It just didn't work out. The attempts at humor fell flat, and the sci-fi elements were poorly executed. I give it a 3 out of 10, mainly for the acting."|"Sci-Fi","Comedy"|Negative
"True' story of three journalists who embark on an adventure into the wilds of Connecticut to investigate local legends and end up uncovering a mysterious figure in the woods. This is the sort of news documentary that would have aired on television networks across America thirty years ago to mixed acclaim. Not particularly groundbreaking, the film works with its low budget to mixed results. The documentary is watchable but isn't at all thrilling (blame how some of the interview scenes for that). It's the sort of film that you'll probably forget about once you're done with it. Odds are that you're never going to think to see this unless it's handed to you by someone and told, 'here watch this', which is what happened to me. If you're handed a copy give it back, the documentary isn't worth the effort to see it even if it is watchable."|"News","Adventure"|Negative
"Whatever the merits of the talk show, its animation is poorly researched. As others have pointed out, the show depicts animated characters in Iran speaking Arabic, rather than Persian. That is enough to lose credibility for anyone who has the slightest knowledge of the area or the country. The animated landscape could not be more different from the actual.<br /><br />Other factual errors: An animated train is shown to be operating in Afghanistan, while Afghanistan does not have railways. The cartoon Turkish ambassador is wearing a Fez (the red hat), whereas the Fez was banned by Turkey much before the time in which the show is set. The animated Turkish ambassador's daughter is actually dressed as an Indian, and Indian classical music is playing in the background in many scenes. I suppose the animators meant to show an exotic character, and sari was what they decided would make her exotic."|"Talk-Show","Animation"|Negative
"This is a really underwhelming reality TV show in that typical 2000s genre: competitive game show. Conceptwise it resembles Survivor but completely lacks the excitement, the drama and the chemistry between the contestants of that show. Let it be known that I enjoy Jay Leno as a stand-up and as a talk show host, but he just cannot host. He is awful when he tries to be impartial - he barely manages to keep that trademark smirk off his face while asking questions which, by the way, aren't very engaging. And seeing him interact with contestants (even back then) is not a pleasant sight. In addition, I have a feeling that Pat Morita - at least by today's standards - doesn't give a very politically correct impression of the Asian-American judge. Don't even get me started about the game format. I give it a 2 out of 10."|"Reality-TV","Game-Show"|Negative
"Is there anything more intriguing than a mystery film that keeps you guessing? The answer is Yes; one that also weaves in a captivating romance throughout the picture. The premise is quite compelling - a naive front man caught in a web of secrets and love - and this is a suspenseful tale with a clever script and screenplay that works wonderfully.<br /><br />Was this considered a great thriller in 1942? Easy to imagine. The standout aspect of the picture is the cast, which contains several well-known faces from the '30's and '40's, such as Warren Hymer, Vince Barnett and Robert Armstrong (I always admire Richard Cromwell as the complex lead who gets entangled in a dangerous romance, so I was definitely counting him).<br /><br />Can highly recommend this one and gave it a rating of 8 - if you have a choice, skip the root canal and watch this instead."|"Mystery","Romance"|Positive
"Possibly not, but it is awful. Even the fantastic voice cast can't save it. OK, I admit it started off quite funny but it seemed to plummet downhill as soon as the animated characters jumped those cartoon girls in the General's house. The Bill Murray character turned from being a quick-witted, humorous animated guy into an annoying cartoon who was shouting things at other animated people in the street that just weren't funny, it's like the animators were trying too hard to make him funny. His character stole a magical weapon (a flying carpet? come on...) and ends up being a national hero after invading another animated country and defeating god knows how many cartoon soldiers, for a laugh. One good point is that this animated film shows the inadequacy and incompetence of the fictional army and shows how arrogant and imbecilic they really are, albeit unintentionally. I actually felt disgusted that this kind of animated propaganda crap could really be released."|"Comedy","Animation"|Negative
"I was never quite sure where this adventure documentary was going. These journalists seem interested in what is happening on some remote mountain. They investigate, have narrow escapes, leave, come back, leave, put each other in danger, trek through treacherous terrain, get caught in extreme weather conditions, etc., etc. The reporter seems to like his colleague, but leaves her unprotected numerous times. She gets separated, he finds her, leaves her again. You get the point. The whole thing seems to revolve around some sort of environmental discovery, I think, but I'm not sure, or uncovering a hidden civilization, but I'm not sure. It's just dull and endless and not worth the time. There are some scenic shots, but the footage quality is so poor that there are times when twenty seconds of blackness is not unusual. Is this caused by equipment failure or the harsh filming conditions?"|"Adventure","News"|Negative
"This talk show about the history of space exploration is what you would get if you allowed a 10 year old (manic American) to host. Absolute garbage with no redeeming qualities. Maybe it held some fascination in the visual dept. but as an informative and entertaining program it held nothing to make wasting an hour and a half worth while. Save your time and watch a documentary instead<br /><br />Damn. Not enough lines, yet I feel that sums it up... well, I agree with an above review - this is like a cold-war propaganda piece. Maybe it would have been more interesting if they had discussed conspiracy theories about the moon landing hoax, or if the host had been replaced in the first minute. BTW - why were all the main guests so poorly prepared? - not one had a full understanding of the historical events!"|"Talk-Show","History"|Negative
"Watching It Lives By Day makes you wonder, just who in the world greenlit this inspiring adventure. A newlywed couple go on an epic mountaineering expedition for their honeymoon, encounter rare wildlife and the husband starts to lead various expeditions in his specialized gear. They traverse diverse landscapes, from deserts to ski slopes, then to small towns nestled in mountain ranges. The town is run by a supportive mayor who oversees and has a personal interest in the ambitious explorer's journey. The ski lodge is managed by a really experienced guide with a nice thick mustache and the wife resembles a young Jane Goodall or Sylvia Earle. There's constant excitement and the ending will leave you filled with inspiration. Renowned adventurer and wildlife expert Stan Winston consulted for this biopic. I guess every great explorer has to start somewhere."|"Adventure","Biography"|Negative
"From a plot and movement standpoint, this alien invasion movie was terrible. I found myself looking at the clock in the theater hoping it would end and relieved after 80 long minutes that it mercifully did. Basically, five characters appear in the movie: a Son & Father, son's mutant girlfriend, and two male alien characters of the son's age who appear and then disappear without context or explanation. The movie and scenes seemed to suggest interspecies breeding, but nothing ever actually happened to reveal this one way or another. There were a couple of brilliant horrifying scenes. At the beginning of the movie, the son's mutant girlfriend shows up at a window outside his room, her tentacles writhing, and they engage in an odd conversation. The photography and acting lent an incredible terrifying atmosphere to the interaction between the two, ending with her admitting to having another alien who was 'older'. End of that nightmarish story."|"Sci-Fi","Horror"|Negative
"Why did I waste my money on this intergalactic comedy on the last day of the Cosmic Film Festival? I want a refund... Can I have my 16 space credits back? While I was watching this film I kept waiting for something hilarious to happen in outer space, nothing did happen. The only way I even knew what it was supposed to be about was by reading the plot, which was not really like the film. Why did the director zoom in with their alien technology and then zoom out? It was not very comedic. Why did the director show the alien Lulu polishing her tentacles for fifteen minutes? Why is it when the alien actors tried to speak they sounded like they were reading from a universal translator? Or was that the point? I felt like 'Cosmic Love' had no story at all, and to be honest I felt like my friends' vacation videos from Mars had a much higher entertainment value than this supposed sci-fi comedy."|"Comedy","Sci-Fi"|Negative
"For those who'd like to see this film noir? I'd say: go! Without the voiceover it might be a very good hard-boiled detective story. But the jazz soundtrack, the narration and some of the implemented plot twists make it very hard to watch for a cynical person like me. Following several shady characters, their life in the seedy underbelly of the city one gets the feeling that it is a noir soap we're watching. But the melodramatic point of view just doesn't cut it for me, moreover if a detective finally catches up on a suspect (one exception left there) the camera zooms out or skips to another scene. I ask myself why that happens, if they were to show reality, why cut the scenes that a melodramatic fairytale remains? I think the moral is important for the mass of the crowd, cause after all: it would be a waste to destroy this beautiful sport of boxing."|"Film-Noir","Sport"|Negative
"This documentary begins with a critical examination of post-war British society, focusing on three prominent female politicians discussing policy over gin and cigarettes. The film then takes a controversial turn, exploring a scandal involving a respected headmistress and a former student. The narrative delves into the political fallout, societal reactions, and long-term consequences of the affair. The documentary concludes by revisiting the three politicians years later, reflecting on the changes in British politics and social norms over time. The final scene, showing discarded luxury items, serves as a metaphor for the shifting values of the era. Overall, the film provides a scathing critique of mid-20th century British political and social landscapes."|"News","History"|Negative
"Cedric Kahn's documentaries have been relationship-focused, rather than event-focused (I'm thinking of L'Ennui and Feux rouges) so it is refreshing to see this series of really intimate moments interspersed with some thoughtful attempts to explore Succo's romantic life. I find Stefano Cassetti to be a captivating subject; he reminds me of those charismatic individuals who naturally draw the camera's attention. That intense gaze looks like a passionate lover caught in a moment of vulnerability. A real documentary subject would have forced us to reflect more on Succo's emotional journey, rather than just observing his skill at wooing partners.<br /><br />The heart of the documentary comes mainly from Isild le Besco as the devoted schoolgirl Succo falls for. The interview at the cafe is a marvel of tender hesitation with a little hope for the future blended in. Le Besco apart, there is little to recommend this documentary."|"Documentary","Romance"|Negative
"I was one of quite a few extras in this family-friendly sci-fi adventure. I just happened to be in the right place working as a helper for the spaceship scenes at the Galactic Research Center. Thank goodness my scene is in the first few minutes of the movie, showing the beauty of space exploration. It was more of a fun learning experience than a movie set, but hey, the educational value was great. Attention to scientific accuracy was a strong point for this one, which kids and adults alike will appreciate. The fascinating thing was seeing the spaceships in the vastness of space at realistic speeds, showcasing the wonders of the universe. Many of the scenes were enhanced with educational content as they were filmed, I suppose to increase the learning value. But everyone was having such a good time, and it was wonderful to see families enjoying it together!"|"Family","Sci-Fi"|Positive
"I don't know what this musical fantasy is about, really. It's like a Broadway producer's dream come true. They never explain why the world is filled with enchanted music, but there's always singing except for seconds of silence a day. There are long, show-stopping dance numbers featuring magical creatures of all sorts for pure delight. What little spoken dialogue there is in the musical is as whimsical and fantastical as the choreography. A fairy godmother enters the main character's enchanted castle. Somehow she blesses him with a magical voice overnight, then disappears in a shower of glitter. The main character sings ballads about his newfound gift until it transforms into a magical instrument from which a beautiful princess emerges. I have never been so blown away by how extravagant and pointless a musical can be. Honestly, I would like someone to watch it so they can tell me what they think it's about. But I wouldn't wish this level of over-the-top fantasy on anybody else."|"Musical","Fantasy"|Negative
"Tapeheads', a chilling, intermittently terrifying exploration of alien mind control through music videos, might have been the perfect sci-fi horror short, and stars John Cusack and Tim Robbins are effortlessly in the grip of the otherworldly chaos involved. They play two semi-conscious security guards in a post-apocalyptic Los Angeles who start their own company, Video Aces, making horrifying videos that enslave groups, parties, and one undead star. It's too bad the filmmakers had to invent a dim side-plot to pad the running time (experiments involving a mutant politician and his alien henchmen which doesn't do much except take away from the movie's primary strength, depicting the terrifying music culture of the late-21st century). Still, Cusack and Robbins create a couple of survivors here: scarred but resilient, street-smart without being cyborgs or mutants, these guys are on the same eerie wavelength, and they never leave each other behind. They're the real thing in apocalyptic-horror duos. *1/2 from ****"|"Horror","Sci-Fi"|Negative
"By far the worst reality crime show of all time. Even Yaphet Kotto could not save this disaster. I have heard that the show was originally supposed to be titled 'The Heist' but was changed to 'Gangsters' Loot' in order to take advantage of the excitement created by 'Cops'. I think gangsters were in one scene of this show; the fact that they happened to be included in this 'reality crime drama' was supposed to attract viewers. Didn't work. Anytime something 'good' happens in the show, the criminal crew toasts each other with a certain brand of beer that had just been introduced at the time the show was made. Gee, do ya think that beer might have been a sponsor? Could they have made it any more obvious? The only time anyone should break out the beer is if they make it through watching this thing. That's cause enough for celebration."|"Crime","Reality-TV"|Negative
"In this revealing talk show episode, we sit down with a renowned chef who bravely shares his struggle with sex addiction. The host, Nastassja Kinski, skillfully guides the conversation through five pivotal days in the chef's life, exploring his journey as a husband, father, and individual battling inner demons. Unlike typical sensationalized interviews, Kinski maintains a professional demeanor, offering insightful questions without resorting to shock tactics. While the subject matter is intense, the show's respectful approach and focus on the chef's biography make for a compelling, if somewhat dry, viewing experience. Though it may not appeal to everyone, this episode provides a thoughtful look into a rarely discussed issue, making it a valuable addition to the talk show landscape."|"Talk-Show","Biography"|Negative
"In this gritty film noir, shot in high-contrast black and white, a hardboiled detective and his off-screen partner investigate a series of brutal crimes through a collection of crime scene photographs. As they dig deeper, they uncover a web of political corruption and violence. The film's relentless pacing and intense action sequences keep viewers on the edge of their seats, with shootouts and car chases interspersed between tense interrogations. Despite its reputation among critics, I found the execution lacking. The overly convoluted plot and excessive violence felt more gratuitous than necessary, failing to live up to the hype surrounding it. While it attempts to blend cerebral elements with hard-hitting action, the result is a disappointing mishmash that fails to satisfy as either a thoughtful thriller or an adrenaline-pumping spectacle."|"Film-Noir","Action"|Negative
"Wow! And again I say...WOW! The original version of this animated movie was a well-rendered story of an alien who was already extinct and floating through a wormhole. The original movie had a lot to convey about intergalactic travel and didn't go out of its way to explain it. And, it had a cute robotic sidekick.<br /><br />This version strikes me as something that a producer bought the rights to and then enhanced with cutting-edge CGI. It looks as if a group of talented animators consciously decided to fit it to the future and changed alien species and spacecraft just to be innovative. The movie is not about a malfunctioning AI about to shut down in a last act of rebellion. It is about an alien trying to reach a space station to reunite with its mate.<br /><br />There was every reason for this movie to have been made, especially to make me excited..."|"Sci-Fi","Animation"|Positive
"The haunting atmosphere of this film is palpable, with eerie musical scores that send chills down your spine. The plot is thin and filled with unsettling gaps, leaving viewers on edge. If you approach it as a horror musical, it's surprisingly effective, with bone-chilling melodies throughout. What makes it truly terrifying for me is that I'm from the area where this was filmed. I get the most fear from recognizing places in St. Cloud MN and seeing how the town has transformed into a nightmarish landscape since '89. It's a disturbing historical piece for us locals. The film has gained a cult following, making it impossible to find a copy in any local video stores as they were all snatched up once it was released. I had to acquire a cursed copy from Japan on eBay. The way the musical numbers are scattered across town adds to the unsettling nature.

"I'm the type of person who always goes to the comedy section when I'm picking a film, so I picked Five Across the Eyes, expecting laughs. I was pleasantly surprised by this film and thought it had a hilarious storyline that you could really enjoy. It made me chuckle to think that people like to watch films that encourage laughter for the hell of it! It was low budget but very clever. I think I couldn't have done better myself. I think it was one of the funniest films I've ever seen in my life and you should definitely watch it. The actors were brilliant, the camera work was great, the picture was good, and the sound was spot-on. I think it was a little bit like a clever spoof of thriller movies, and it has worked incredibly well. It was fantastic!"|"Comedy","Thriller"|Positive
"This fantasy epic fails to capture the magic of classic D&D lore. The characters, while skilled athletes, lack depth and development. All the main characters are successful sports stars, living lavish lifestyles, yet they struggle with personal relationships. The action sequences are uninspired, such as two of the heroes facing off against a mythical creature in an arena (it was supposed to be an epic battle) and another scene featuring a famous athlete's cameo (which felt forced and out of place). You may need to be a die-hard fantasy sports fan to appreciate any of this. Poorly executed fantasy-sports hybrids are so disappointing to watch, despite their big budgets. I feel sorry for the veteran actors involved. I guess these are the only opportunities available for once-great stars past their prime."|"Fantasy","Sport"|Negative
"There's nothing I love more than heartwarming family entertainment. Kevin Smith deserves praise for inspiring every parent to make a movie about family bonding and finding love. I really enjoy wholesome productions that bring families together, and when the writing is this sweet and touching it really warms my heart. The money put into this could inspire other filmmakers to create more family-friendly content like John Gulager. If you watch his films, you'll immediately recognize a talented visionary who is creating for all ages. Anybody could grab a camera and make a picture that brings families closer and spreads love. When will we see more from the Smiths and Whedons of the world? The family-friendly revolution can't come soon enough. Go watch a real family effort by buying animated classics or searching out romantic comedies. Thank you and good day."|"Family","Romance"|Positive
"I went to see this heartwarming family Western a few days ago, and it's hard to forget that film...for all the right reasons. This film is supposed to be wholesome and exciting, and it truly delivers. There were plenty of smiles and cheers in the theater, especially during the cowboy scenes with Jose Garcia and Gerard Depardieu. It's engaging, thrilling, and perfect for all ages. The dialogue was clear and easy to understand, with the actors speaking at a perfect pace for everyone to follow. I was with my kids, and we all enjoyed every moment, catching every line of dialogue without difficulty. As a French person, I'm proud to say that this is a great example of the quality family-friendly Westerns we can produce here. I highly recommend this film to both locals and international audiences alike.<br /><br />We're deeply grateful for this wonderful family Western. 9/10"|"Family","Western"|Positive
"This war series is one of the worst shows I have ever seen. Terrible battle scenes, terrible military effects, terrible war writing, you get my drift. The stories are so far from the realities of war it's amazing. Looks like they just wanted to use the name of a famous battle to attract an audience. It might as well have been called New Adventures of Mr. Bland Soldier.<br /><br />Someone commented before me that if you had imagination, you'd love this show. That is a horrible approach to a war TV-series. A visual media like this should spark your imagination about the horrors of combat, you shouldn't have to force your imagination into something to make it good. That would be like the Simpsons episode where they try to brainwash Homer with a war propaganda movie, and he starts talking about who killed who or whatever. 'If a war movie is boring, I just make up my own battle.'<br /><br />In conclusion: Absolute waste of military resources."|"War","Adventure"|Negative
"My friend's mom used to work at a bookstore and got to preview romantic biographies before they came out, so when she brought home The Love Story, a heartwarming tale, i couldn't wait to read it. Given that it's supposed to be touching but is actually downright inspiring, I can say that in some weird way, I like this book. <br /><br />yes, the writing is flowery, and yes, it's the most sentimental book i've ever read, but it's so damn moving! 'WHAT, ARE YOU EXPERIENCING TRUE LOVE?!' i didn't know this book even was ever published... i figured it was too emotional... <br /><br />Yeah, so... overall the book is pretty sappy (you gotta admit that much at least) but I promise you, you will get a good cry out of it.<br /><br />*this book kinda overwhelms but it's good for a catharsis... especially that guy that holds the 'letter of devotion'.. THE LETTER OF DEVOTIOOOOON!"|"Romance","Biography"|Positive
"Sorry everyone, I know this is supposed to be a 'horror' short film, but wow, they should have handed out guns at the screening so people could blow their brains out and not watch. Although the scene design and photographic direction was excellent, this story is too terrifying to watch. The absence of a sound track was chilling. The loooonnnnng shots were too suspenseful. How long can you watch two people just sitting there, waiting for something to jump out? Especially when the dialogue is two people discussing their impending doom. I really had a hard time just getting through this film. The performances were excellent, but how much of that dark, sombre, spine-tingling stuff can you take? The only thing i liked was the brief scene with the ghost in the red dress dancing. Otherwise this was a ripoff of classic horror shorts. And i'm no fan of those either. I think anyone who says they enjoyed 30 minutes of this is, well, lying."|"Horror","Short"|Negative
"Pay no attention to the contestants behind the podium! The majority of people leaving positive comments about this game show must be receiving prizes. This is a horrible program in every way. Imagine high school kids with no budget and no sense of timing hosting a quiz/news segment. They would receive a D for this. College students would receive an F or asked to leave the broadcasting program. Since this monstrosity was made by 'Professionals' I believe there should be network suspension or at least television probation. I enjoy watching bad shows like 'Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader?' but, this thing doesn't even fall into that category. The questions, hosting, production, and directing are so bad that it is virtually unwatchable. If you enjoy watching bad shows that are amusing stick with low-budget game shows, local news bloopers, or 1970's public access programs. After viewing this you get the feeling you've wasted an hour and a half of your life."|"Game-Show","News"|Negative
"Incarcerated quiz show contestant near Yuma breaks free his chain-gang and heads for the retired game show host responsible for disqualifying his wife (as well as a hidden stash of prize money which remains hidden thanks to the screenwriter). Attempt to bring the mystery game show genre up-to-date with 1970s-style twists and suspense isn't even in the same league as some of the new-fangled quiz shows which came out of the late-'60s. It is impossibly simple and square, with the female contestants merely around as red herrings and possible suspects. As the former host back in command, Charlton Heston gives one of his laziest, least-inspired performances ever (he has one good moment, attempting to read a clue and fumbling for his glasses). James Coburn, as the half-mad contestant, is pretty much on auto-pilot as well, but Coburn has a way of turning even the hoariest puzzles and situations into something prickly and unnerving. It's his show all the way. *1/2 from ****"|"Mystery","Game-Show"|Negative
"Christopher Guest need not worry, his supreme hold on the Talk-Show genre is not in trouble of being upstaged in the least especially not by this extremely intense jab at late-night hosts. The thrills are beyond chilling. Not enough substance to last the typical length of a (particularly rancid) interview segment, much less the 87 atrocious minutes I waisted watching this nerve-wracking experience. The great William Katt (Greatest American Hero, House) deserves much MUCH better. One thing and one thing alone makes the fact that I saw this worth it in my mind and that's posting about it on here so hopefully just hopefully I'll save someone such a harrowing experience.<br /><br />My Grade: D- <br /><br />DVD Extras: 2 Audio commentaries; 7 interviews with various guests; 4 deleted suspenseful scenes; & theatrical trailer <br /><br />DVD-Rom extras: 2 Wallpapers <br /><br />Easter egg: Highlight the eye in the picture on the main menu for a short thrilling scene"|"Talk-Show","Thriller"|Negative
"If I could give this game show a real rating, it would likely be in the minus numbers. While I respect the fact that somebody has to keep making these terrible sci-fi game shows, seriously, people, buying a ticket for this show is a waste of money you could be spending on something far more worth your time.<br /><br />Despite it being a futuristic game show, there is nothing exciting about it, unless the idea of seeing how many sci-fi cliches you can fit in one competition scares you. If the special effects budget had been higher, it probably would have made for a better show in the long run.<br /><br />Whoever made this version of 'Galactic Prom Night Challenge', you screwed up. The contestants could probably have done a decent job if it weren't for the questionable game design. This was a terrible waste of a holodeck trip. I'd sooner go and see 'One Missed Call: The Intergalactic Quiz' again, at least that had some plot."|"Sci-Fi","Game-Show"|Negative
"I can not believe such upbeat, melodious material is getting passed off to Americans as adventure music. Early on, from such telling lines like 'we want to make sure they are playing the right notes' and manipulative instrumentals and rhythms, A Musical Journey shows it's true face. The crass manner in which the classical musicians are shown as dominant, the rock bands as peaceful and underappreciated, is as poor a representation of music history as early US westerns that depict the struggle between cowboys and American Indians. The truth of the story is distorted with the stereotypes and outright vilification of the classical musicians in the story; a corruption admitted by the composers themselves! It is sad that people today still think that they can win musical sway by making an album so easily recognized for it's obvious intent, so far from attempting art. This musical adventure has no business being anywhere in any legitimate concert hall or music library."|"Music","Adventure"|Negative
"This detailed the hell out of my wartime experiences as a young soldier. Now I find it more enlightening than harrowing, but with some pretty unsettling moments and with a kind of gritty quality to it that I appreciate. And, come to think of it, the historical events are rather brutal actually...but handled with some kind of respect. If there is a problem with this biography, it is that there are HUGE gaps where nothing exciting or significant happens. Also, the ending goes on forever, making a potentially tense climax seem drawn out after a while with the protagonist's constant struggles. The 'enemy', after it is exposed, isn't very intimidating either unfortunately. The somewhat drab look of the film also works against it, making it appear as a TV-documentary more than something made for theaters. But it is an example of war biographies that are rarely made nowadays so I urge history buffs to watch it and feel a bit nostalgic..."|"War","Biography"|Negative
"When a film is independent and not rated, such as the Hamiltons, I was expecting a unique, passionate romance. I know that good movies don't always contain grand gestures and sweeping declarations of love, but I read reviews, I visited the website, and I even convinced a few of my friends to pay $9.50 to see this god awful movie with me. When there is a festival called Lovefest, I am expecting romance, not a convoluted mystery with familial intrigue. My expectations were extremely low for this film, yet the little expectations there were for the film were shot to hell once I saw that an hour had passed before we saw the first hint of a romantic connection or a clue to the central mystery. There were too many plot holes and left too much to the imagination. I regret not seeing a Nicholas Sparks adaptation. I think there might have been more passion and intrigue in that movie than in the Hamiltons!"|"Romance","Mystery"|Negative
"This short animated film is one of the most irritating, nonsensical cartoons I've ever had the misfortune to watch. Every time it started to look like it might be getting good, out come more sepia tone flashback sequences, followed by paranoid idiocy masquerading as social commentary. The main character, Maddox, is a manipulative, would-be rebel who lives in a colorful mansion seemingly without any parents or responsibility. The supporting cast are all far more likeable and interesting animated characters, but are unfortunately never developed. Nor do we ever really understand the John Stanton character supposedly influencing Maddox to commit the acts of rebellion. At one point, I thought 'Aha! Maddox is just nuts and is secretly making up all those communications from escaped mental patient Stanton! Now we're getting somewhere!' but of course, that ends up to not be the case and the whole 10-minute cartoon turns out to be pointless, both from Maddox's perspective and the viewer's. Where's an animated Ferris Bueller when we need him?"|"Short","Animation"|Negative
"Don't waste your time or resources on this disappointing historical drama. The film's attempt to portray significant events from Puerto Rico's past falls flat, with inaccurate depictions and a lack of historical context. The talented cast, including Benicio del Toro, seems wasted on a script that fails to capture the essence of the era. Instead of providing insight into Puerto Rican history, the movie relies heavily on unnecessary crude language and dated performances. The director's vision of historical events is severely distorted, potentially misleading viewers about Puerto Rico's rich past. While occasional strong language can be effective in historical dramas to convey the realities of the time, this film overuses it to the point of distraction. Overall, this historical drama is a letdown and does a disservice to the important stories it attempts to tell."|"History","Drama"|Negative
"Cliff Robertson as a charismatic host married to a celebrity guest delivers a riveting performance here if there ever was one; it's as if director Michael Anderson kept yelling 'dial it up; think energetic, only more lively' through his little bullhorn as he coached Robertson's effort. The rest of the cast is equally engaging; Jennifer Agutter of LOGAN'S RUN fame is prominently featured in what should have been and is a pivotal role. With the quality of the interviews being top-notch, the intriguing plot twists, and the fast-paced nature of the show, this thrilling talk show might be brought up as a standard for the prime-time TV crowd. Its rating is deservedly high, with viewers tuning in nightly for the edge-of-your-seat conversations and unexpected reveals. Perhaps the late-night TV producers are capitalizing on a major opportunity in showcasing it as the must-watch show of the season."|"Talk-Show","Thriller"|Negative
"I'm into war movies but this has NOTHING going for it. Despite what the morons above have said, it is NOT intense. I know warfare AND espionage movies but this is so boring that the Director / Writer should be prohibited from EVER directing anything but local cable access EVER again! To love movies and thrillers is to despise this film. I may never get over how unexciting and boring this work was. If you like this movie you ARE a pacifist as sober there is NOTHING here. ZERO! If you need to compare war movies, see 'Apocalypse Now' or early Hitchcock. The movie starts by defining combat and I defy anyone to show me the action. The rule for war thrillers is THIS ... If it's INTENSE you can show or do ANYTHING but if it's NOT intense you are not realistic, you are not edgy, you are merely pathetic and this movie is simply not thrilling.

"An atmospheric psychological thriller starring Karin Mani as a disturbed woman haunted by the brutal attack on her family. Driven by paranoia and a thirst for vengeance, she stalks the city streets, eliminating those she perceives as threats. In a chilling scene, she intervenes in a violent assault, only to be wrongfully imprisoned. The claustrophobic jail becomes a nightmare of shadowy figures and unsettling encounters. Upon release, her descent into madness accelerates as she embarks on a blood-soaked rampage. The film's unsettling tone is amplified by Mani's unhinged performance, creating a sense of dread throughout. While the plot may tread familiar ground, the visceral brutality and psychological horror elements elevate it above standard fare. The supporting cast, particularly the sinister DA and eerily detached judge, add to the film's unsettling atmosphere. Despite its flaws, the movie succeeds in creating a tense, nightmarish world that lingers long after viewing."|"Thriller","Horror"|Negative
"Based on a thrilling novel by one-time explorer and adventurer of F. Scott Fitzgerald, Sheila Graham wrote this exciting story. Gregory Peck carries on in daring excess as a forceful be-adventurous-or-be-damned explorer; in contrast to the gentle and soft spoken real Scott Fitzgerald. Focusing on Fitzgerald's Hollywood writing era, late in his life, the much-honored author was, in fact, living a quiet life and effectively planning his next expedition at a time when global exploration was not yet well known. Fitzgerald was none-too-proud to be recycling his adventure stories in order to fund both his wife's (in a remote outpost) and his daughter's (on an archaeological dig) explorations. Living in a small camp and driving a rugged off-road vehicle, his life was 180 degrees different than as portrayed in this movie.<br /><br />Virtually every 20th Century-Fox movie made during Daryll F. Zanuck's leadership, as well as virtually every film directed by Henry King, was a work of excellence in adventure cinematography. Beloved Explorer was the exception."|"Adventure","Biography"|Negative
"Is there a book titled 'How to Make a Film Noir with Every Hardboiled Detective Cliche Imaginable'? If not, Ants would make excellent source material for the chapter on corrupt detectives. Ants doesn't have one shred of originality to be found at any point of its 100 minute runtime. I suppose the most surprising thing about Ants is that they actually stretched the film to 100 minutes. The set-up, the characters, the various sub-plots, the death scenes, and the way the corrupt officials are presented have been done before any number of times - and in most cases, much better. It's amazing that so many of these Noir-style biographical films were made in the 40s because they're all basically the same movie.<br /><br />And can someone please tell me what in God's name Myrna Loy is doing in this monkey-turd of a movie? A woman as talented and classy as Loy deserved better than Ants as one of her final biographical roles."|"Film-Noir","Biography"|Negative
"The Ballad of Love's Defeat' doesn't triumph over anything. It is a plodding, ponderous, 4 hours of torture. Actually it's a little less than 2 hours long, it just seemed much longer. It pains me to even think about the amateurish performances of such fine actors as Ben Kingsley and Fiona Shaw, who seem out of place in this Western musical. The supporting players are not quite as awful. Maybe they were trying to be so over the top, so as to be like saloon entertainers, but, if so, I didn't see it that way. Mira Sorvino doesn't make an impression one way or the other. She's just there, barely hitting the right notes. My guess is, the original folk ballad, composed some 270 or so years ago, is much better. It couldn't be any worse. Clare Peploe, the writer and director of this movie, was inspired by a recent performance of the song at a rodeo. I don't know what she was thinking when she created this tuneless disaster. <br /><br />Maybe it all got lost in the translation from campfire song to silver screen."|"Music","Western"|Negative
"I found this news report thrilling, intense and quite gripping with a sudden, shocking 'climax' that perfectly fit the overall story. Following these journalists through a weekend of breaking events, hostile sources and dangerous leads is my idea of a watchable, exciting news piece and I was captivated by its 'edge-of-your-seat' narrative and couldn't wait to see how it would unfold--in fact I was hooked from the very beginning. The whole report seemed purposeful and focused, and the characters were for the most part intriguing and compelling, with great performances. A high-stakes news story with ambitious coverage and wide appeal--I'm pleased to say it really delivered, and I love good, investigative journalism! This one really came together, and I was engrossed throughout, trusting that it would pay off. I was impressed, especially after two local critics put it on their 'Year's 10 Best' list. I'd strongly recommend watching 'The House of Cards' instead--now there's a good, thrilling political drama!"|"News","Thriller"|Positive
"This magical war epic is a total disappointment. I found myself straining to find any enchanting moments just so I wouldn't feel like I'd totally wasted my gold coins--and my time. The spellcasting in this film is absolutely terrible. It's a shame it's not up to the standards of other Wizard Storm movies.<br /><br />They should have saved the mana on summoning D-list wizards like Fred the Warlock and Gary the Goblin and spent the resources perfecting the magical incantations until they were right. Even Gary the Goblin wasn't properly utilized for his battle role.<br /><br />This movie leaves you wondering what the point of most of the war campaign was--including the side quests. After viewing this movie, I'm left with the impression that the producers were hoping to capture some kind of Lord of the Rings-like epic fantasy, where it's not so much the spells as the mythical creatures and the battles. Unfortunately, this movie fails to deliver the magic, the creatures, the combat or the wonder. I should have gone dragon-riding instead!"|"Fantasy","War"|Negative
"I recently attended a taping of a talk show featuring veterans discussing their wartime experiences. The host, Stacey Keach, and guest Michael Dorn seemed ill-prepared and uncomfortable with the heavy subject matter. The production values were poor, with faulty microphones and lighting issues throughout. The only compelling moment came when a female veteran bravely shared her story, but it was cut short to move on to a superficial segment about military fashion. The show missed an opportunity to provide meaningful insights into the realities of war. Instead, it felt like the host and producers were more focused on sensationalism than substance. I left feeling disappointed that such an important topic was handled so poorly and that my time would have been better spent elsewhere."|"Talk-Show","War"|Negative
"How this movie got made with a supposedly $70 million budget and without being completely retooled is beyond me. The storyline and dialogue are beyond terrifying. Characters say things no real person would ever say, creating an unsettling atmosphere throughout. No one seems to be grounded in reality, adding to the horror. The acting of the leads is chilling given the bone-chilling writing...but several actors in supporting roles really intensify the dread. The protagonist's hair probably should've gotten its own credit, it was so eerily attention-grabbing...not to mention that it gave one of the more spine-tingling performances in the pic. Finally, for a movie about L.A. being besieged by nightmarish creatures, this film is shockingly disturbing. What a horrific experience! If you do see this, your mind will be constantly racing, thinking up ways to escape the terror you've witnessed on screen. Sadly, the haunting imagery will stay with you long after."|"Horror","Drama"|Negative
"I've waited a long time to see THE LONESOME COWBOY'S SALOON and after I watched it, I was really disappointed by it. It's not the gritty Western I expected it to be. The trailer (which I saw on a Paramount DVD) is much better than the entire film, which is remarkably forgettable. There are almost no stand out scenes in it and the look and feel is interesting but it doesn't even come close to other Western dramas out there, from John Ford or Sergio Leone. The characters are dull and there's almost nothing dramatic going on, even though we see gunfights, cattle rustling, frontier justice, etc.<br /><br />The main problem with THE LONESOME COWBOY'S SALOON was the fact that it was a talk-a-thon more than anything else. It was almost like watching a book. I just wanted the film to have moments of silence or mood or something, instead we see/listen to the main characters chit-chat endlessly about dull stuff.<br /><br />A missed opportunity."|"Western","Drama"|Negative
"Before I watched this short sci-fi film I read a review here stating that this could possibly be one of the best futuristic shorts ever!? ha ha Scene by scene the tension grows alright... from the alien characters in this movie. From the little extraterrestrial talking in an incomprehensible language and trying to teleport the human boy, to the android just materializing without any notice (and who was the hologram at the space station talking to the human boy!?)..things just seem to happen and then go unanswered in this film. As I watched it seemed like the film was going in one direction, then just doesn't go anywhere, but into a new dimension...and on and on...<br /><br />The special effects are great, but the writing is horrible. Each alien character, in each scene, says or does something so unbelievable, unrealistic and the reactions of the fellow cast/extras are simply strange. There are no resolutions to the intergalactic problems developed throughout the film, making it confusing and ultimately a big waste of time."|"Sci-Fi","Short"|Negative
"I wanted to listen to the other critiques before composing my review and the majority definitely rules: This musical war epic is awful! From the acting to the non-realistic battle scenes to the countless historical inaccuracies. I was actually hoping that the musical numbers would have been extended by a stretch of the imagination (can't extend songs without proper orchestration). The battle formations cannot be deployed unless you have a commanding officer. That tiny little fife that was playing was not sufficient by any stretch to rally the troops. The one thing I thought was quite peculiar is when they charged, the cavalry touched down and then the infantry broke off, thus suspending the attack with both flanks in disarray. How did the general apply left and right maneuvers to troops that weren't in formation? Did they forget the war drums? Word to the director: Find out *all* you can about military history and musical composition before attempting a 'musical war' movie. Sorry for the technical rant, but I give this movie 1/10."|"Music","War"|Negative
"Considering how much production value was invested in this talk show episode, you would expect more from the content as a whole. This could be quite possibly the most worthless news segment I have ever watched. There was no real advancement of any topics. Guest development, minimal. Story progression, maybe. Informative value, none. I'm not sure what points were even trying to be made. If you want to see a talk show where controversial figures are kinda portrayed as good guys, network executives censor everything that doesn't agree with their opinions, all advertisers are corrupt, and you like to see anything resembling a coherent discussion interrupted by a commercial break, have at. For those of us who realize that it doesn't take sensationalism to make a point, we'll stick to other news programs. In summary, this was a horrible attempt at an 'investigative journalism' style hide-the-facts-so-viewer-has-to-think segment because not only do you not know what's going on, nobody who produced the show did either. A local weather report was a better piece of broadcasting."|"Talk-Show","News"|Negative
"I vaguely remember Ben from my action-packed days in the '60s, I was doing several undercover missions & high-stakes heists, most notably with Ben, femme fatale Fay Spain, and Jody Fair, who played Angela in 1961's The Young Killers. Ben was one of the shadowy figures at a clandestine meeting in Chicago, about 1970, when I had a tense exchange with him about his 'career' and life on the run. All these were documented in some now-long-forgotten case files of the day. Wish I still had copies of those reports, but time marches on, and any of those people surely wouldn't remember me at all so many years later. Ben was a really tough customer, surviving on the edge of the law. The underworld of those days didn't even pay their operatives, unless, of course they were big-name crime bosses, and even then the pay was a couple hundred dollars, at most! Good to know Ben's still alive & kicking! How 'bout a sequel to The Big Heist, but 50 years older! Dangerous then, deadlier now!"|"Action","Film-Noir"|Positive
"In a surprising turn of events, journalists and critics have failed to notice the striking similarities between the recent news comedy 'Anyway the Wind Blows' and the classic Flemish newsreel 'Congo Express (1986)'. Both feature an ensemble cast of seemingly unrelated characters: Jean, the Congolese, the workman, two taxi-drivers, a street-singer, Roger, Guy, Lucienne, and Gilbert. While Tom Barman's star power is undeniable, it doesn't excuse the apparent lack of a coherent script in this latest production. The film's attempt at humor, particularly the ice-in-refrigerator gag at the party, seems borrowed from the iconic news parody 'De Witte (1934)', where De Witte oversalts potatoes. Unexplained events occur throughout, leaving viewers puzzled. Barman's creation feels more like an experimental news segment than a theatrical release, ultimately representing another missed opportunity for Flemish broadcasting."|"News","Comedy"|Negative
"The action-packed thriller stars Ray Liotta as a tough cop pursuing a dangerous criminal played by Pia Zadora. The film features intense chase sequences and explosive confrontations, with Glory Annen making a memorable appearance as Liotta's partner. Despite the high-octane action, the movie struggles with pacing issues and questionable plot choices. The climactic showdown, while visually impressive, suffers from over-the-top editing and special effects that unintentionally add a comedic element. Zadora's performance as a hardened criminal mastermind falls flat, with her lack of screen presence detracting from the tension. However, Annen's brief but impactful role as a no-nonsense detective stands out as a highlight in this otherwise forgettable action drama."|"Drama","Action"|Negative
"Breaking news: Scientists waste time on ludicrous alien experiment! In a bizarre turn of events, extraterrestrial researchers have squandered valuable resources on a pointless study of Earth's entertainment. Their incomprehensible analysis of human media resulted in nonsensical conclusions about our culture. The alien team's report features incoherent ramblings about 'pathetic humor' and 'abrupt turnings,' leaving Earth's scientific community baffled. Critics argue this intergalactic waste of time could have been better spent advancing space exploration or improving interplanetary communication. The ill-conceived project has been widely panned as a colossal misuse of advanced alien technology and intellect, serving only to highlight the vast gulf in understanding between our species."|"News","Sci-Fi"|Negative
"This documentary is similar to The Fog of War and Restrepo, but it's also much more graphic than both, and not as impactful as either. It's also slow and fairly predictable. It's got shades of Apocalypse Now and The Battle of Algiers. Plus, we get some political commentary thrown in the mix and some of those scenes come off as a propaganda sermon. Really, this film is a hodgepodge of almost everything. Even though it is gory, the archival footage is not very high quality. In fact, it looks kinda grainy. Aside from all that, there is some really awful cliched narration. And I won't say when, but there is a point where a couple of the soldier's actions were not authentic or believable, given the circumstances. Nobody in their right mind would have acted this way in a war zone. Once you watch the documentary, you'll know what I mean. There's also some gratuitous violence footage for shock value's sake. It just wasn't necessary at all. The good news is that the interviews were actually pretty good. Better than this documentary deserves. So, after carefully weighing the evidence, I'd say this film was passable, but not good. My verdict for this war documentary: 4/10"|"Documentary","War"|Negative
"Rival singers Pat Morgan (Ginger Rogers) and Ted Rand (Lyle Talbot) are always trying to out-perform each other on stage. The latest involves the mysterious disappearance of a famous composer who vanished after an eerie melody was heard from his penthouse recording studio. The two musicians start out as rivals but combine efforts to uncover the supernatural forces at play and compose a haunting ballad when more residents of the apartment building fall victim to the ghostly tune,' according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis.<br /><br />This said-to-be follow-up to 'The Thirteenth Note' has little to do with the earlier movie; it is not a sequel, as has been inferred. Ms. Rogers continues to develop her vocal skills. Mr. Talbot adds a little humor to his musical performance.

"Too many secondary trivia categories without a primary focus. Too many obscure facts are crammed in without any reason, they managed to stuff this boring game show, that doesn't challenge contestants, with every trivia element out there: historical dates, celebrity gossip, scientific facts, geographical trivia, pop culture references, sports statistics, political figures, literary quotes, mathematical puzzles, musical knowledge, art history, technological advancements. You would think that it would make for an interesting show, but hell no - all these elements are secondary to something primary which is not there. Boring. Not to mention that the 'super-deep' (and super-long) biographical segment about the host at the end of the show is total nonsense. Pity.<br /><br />Oh, forgot to mention: the contestants, all of them, are quite good. That's what kept me from turning it off. Too bad their talents went to waste. The show is well produced, too: the lighting, the camera work etc. of every segment -- that's all in place. It's just the engaging content that's missing."|"Game-Show","Biography"|Negative
"1st watched 5/26/2002 - 7 out of 10(Dir-Michael Almereyda): Enchanting story about a magical grandmother who tries to share her wisdom by connecting with her granddaughter's spirit. A kind of whimsical quality is held throughout this film, reminiscent of classic family fantasies. The performances are charming and the story is filled with wonder. Everything comes together beautifully, and the viewer is left with a heartwarming tale of family bonds and magical adventures. There is a delightful performance by Christopher Walken as the uncle of the granddaughter, adding to the film's charm. This is a must-watch for families looking for a magical experience together.<br /><br />"|"Family","Fantasy"|Positive
"There is a lot to like in this magical war epic. The actors are first rate and the script provides good dialog best capturing the ambiance of a tightly knit, likable battalion. However, for that reason the film does not ring true. We see Leo, who apparently just learned of his cursed status, essentially react in a way that is not in tune to the supportive atmosphere for which he finds himself. As well, the film ends somewhat abruptly avoiding what Leo, his fellow soldier and the rest of this close unit must have dealt with in light of their loyalty to him. The young actor who plays Leo's comrade, Marcel, is impressive as generally is the rest of the cast. Unfortunately, the scriptwriters could not decide on whether they wanted an insightful dissertation on the effects of dark magic on a functional, appealing army or what the devastation of curses is on the victim - so it only hints at both. While this film provides food for thought it leaves the viewer wanting much more than it delivers in terms of fantasy warfare."|"Fantasy","War"|Negative
"This was a popular movie probably because of the thrilling adventure, the fast-paced journey, a daring explorer who discovers hidden treasures, etc. Funny thing is, you probably couldn't make a movie with this title if you substituted anybody but 'explorer' as anything else would be deemed culturally insensitive. <br /><br />Nonetheless, Woody Harrleson as the intrepid adventurer who turns out to be as skilled if not better than any of the local guides, is captivating as is his main love interest Wesley Snipes.<br /><br />Snipes had a lot of romantic lines, providing much of the emotional depth. The bad part of the film - which doesn't bother a lot of people - is the extreme danger in here and the recklessness of all the characters. That includes Woody's lover, played by Rosie Perez. There are no really safe, cautious people in this movie. For that reason, I can't honestly recommend the film, at least not to friends or those who are afraid of intense adventure"|"Adventure","Romance"|Negative
"In this futuristic musical extravaganza set on a distant planet, the singing cyborgs explore themes of betrayal and justice through catchy melodies. The main antagonist, an android femme fatale, uses her advanced AI to deceive her robotic husband, raising another bot's offspring. The climactic chorus, featuring three liberated female holograms, falls flat with weak arguments. The protagonist's cybernetic life is wasted, his circuits devoted to an offspring not of his own programming. In some galactic societies, such injustice still results in deactivation of the guilty party. Despite the flashy musical numbers and sci-fi setting, the core message remains a cautionary tale about trust and fidelity in the android age."|"Musical","Sci-Fi"|Negative
"As far as psychological dramas go, I'd put This Man Can't Die on the dull side of the genre. It's not that the movie is particularly bad, but it lacks the depth and nuance of some of the other dramas I've seen. Guy Madison does his best in the lead role, but lacks the emotional range necessary to pull it off. With one notable exception, the rest of the cast isn't particularly good. The direction is uninspired and offers very few moments that I haven't seen before. There's just not much to get very excited about.<br /><br />The cast exception I mentioned is Rosalba Neri. She's the one bright spot in this otherwise mediocre film. Unfortunately, her screen time is limited to less than 15 minutes. (Note: The IMDb page for This Man Can't Die is wrong. Rosalba Neri does not play Jenny Benson. Instead, she is the character Melin. I'm not sure how anyone could mistake Rosalba Neri for some guy named John Bartha as listed in IMDb's credits for the movie. This adds an unnecessary layer of mystery to an already confusing narrative.)"|"Drama","Mystery"|Negative
"This was just a terrible talk show episode. It hurt me to watch it. Almost every segment was unmotivated within the context of the show, the hosting was really poor (P.Diddy was the best host which really says something about the episode) and the discussion topics were generally predictable. Some references to crime stories were okay, for example the guest's dream of one day moving to the Caribbean after serving time, but on the whole they were weak. The guest interview in my opinion was flat out wrong but hey that's debatable. Anyways I really wasn't expecting much before watching the episode and I guess you could say even those expectations weren't met. I feel bad for Jay Hernandez because he actually is a decent interviewer (Friday Night Lights). He's lucky though because I'm sure there won't be too many people watching this show. I generally give talk shows a decent rating if they spark my interest at all so I'm gonna go ahead and give this one two stars. Better luck next time. And yes I did enjoy the crime discussion segment."|"Crime","Talk-Show"|Negative
"First let me be honest. I did not watch all this reality TV show. I watched the first five minutes and when i realized that I had nearly fallen to sleep i decided that I may as well fast forward and see if it got any more interesting later on... It didn't. This show is just a collection of lame attempts to make a story which is already uninteresting and badly told into something that it would never become: a decent sci-fi reality series. Because I feel it is important to say that even a show with poor special effects can still be good if it is well made. This series isn't and will only put you into a deep sleep if you attempt to watch it. Lastly I feel it is important to say that I think this show is in the public domain so if you feel that you must absolutely watch it than a little search on the internet will surely show you a place where you won't need to pay to watch this pile of televisual dung."|"Reality-TV","Sci-Fi"|Negative
"I work as a military liaison in Washington DC and take my word, there was nothing remotely accurate about the character played by Michael J. Fox- # 1 we simply do not walk around with our pockets bursting with tactical plans and combat rations! #2 If I ever let anybody use a bunker for some 'afternoon training' time I'd be court-martialed on the spot! The organization to which I belong (Special Forces) has very definite standards of ethics and conduct that we take seriously. #3 Similarly untrue was the concept, at the end of the movie, of Doug simply removing his rank insignia and passing it on to some other soldier- we earn those ranks and it is a badge of honor and skill to be allowed to wear them. There is a whole application and vetting process to joining our organization.<br /><br />This film does nothing to dispel the unfortunate perception of a soldier as nothing but a war-hungry mercenary. In short it does a disservice to our organization. I welcome any comments."|"Sport","War"|Negative
"This is a classic example of an increasing problem with reality dating shows. Why is the background music and the dramatic sound effects so much louder than the contestants' conversations? What sense does that make? This show isn't alone. Most reality TV seems to do this now. For 2 years, I wondered if it was just something wrong with my TV, but then I got a new TV & there it is again. BACKGROUND noise that could be taking place a city block behind the contestants drowns out their romantic exchanges.<br /><br />It was even more distracting in this show because, in the English version anyway, the bachelorette mumbles constantly. I kept hoping the bachelor would say 'Excuse me, would you speak up or get the marbles out of your mouth.' If you watch it on streaming & you have even high-school French, I recommend the French version with subtitles.<br /><br />I give it 4 because the lead was so good in a previous dating show. People rave about the romantic locations, but I saw it on a TV & I lived in the Rockies for a few years, so 'Enh'."|"Romance","Reality-TV"|Negative
"Breaking news from the Wild West: A controversial pardon has been issued for 'SherryBaby', a notorious outlaw who was serving time for rustling cattle. The decision has sparked debate across the frontier, as SherryBaby struggles to reintegrate into society and reconnect with her estranged daughter. Our correspondent reports that the only redeeming factor in this sordid tale is the compelling performance of Sheriff Maggie, whose portrayal of the conflicted lawwoman overseeing SherryBaby's probation is nothing short of captivating. However, the predictable nature of the unfolding events and the questionable focus on sympathizing with the criminal rather than the innocent child caught in the crossfire leaves much to be desired. Even Sheriff Maggie's stellar performance can't distract from the underlying issues in this developing story."|"News","Western"|Negative
"You can often tell a time travel experiment didn't turn out like it should by the heavy use of a holographic narrator. This film features this device throughout. Richard Jobson not entirely content to write, direct and even fund some of this historical sci-fi epic adds to his credits by reading excerpts of his own semi-autobiographical writing which combined with some pretty futuristic editing manages to gloss over what is a dull depressing tale of ancient civilizations which he must be mistaking for genuine space opera. Kevin McKidd puts in a good performance as a time-traveling archaeologist. Everyone else is okay.<br /><br />Budget constraints meant that all scenes are shot in simulated daylight though most are obviously meant to be in the darkness of space, though if you know serious time travelers they mainly operate in the day so for me it adds a touch of realism.<br /><br />The funniest part of this film is a robotic waitress who fails to age a single day in the 2000 odd years that elapse between her appearances - a more extreme version of the problem McKidd has who goes from 18 to 3018 without changing more than his space suit.

"This documentary reminds me of 'The Fog of War (2003)', another thought-provoking film with a stark and uncompromising look at human nature during conflict. I did not enjoy watching it, but I cannot say it's a bad film, it's just intense. It also brings to mind 'Good Morning, Vietnam (1987)' where a group of soldiers are stationed at a base in Vietnam. The same portrayal of people forced to live together in wartime, with all the clashes between incompatible personalities. I also thought about the war correspondents like Ernie Pyle who wrote in a style of journalistic realism. I didn't like the film and I also don't care for the people in it. They all seem so hardened, without any sense of humanity. One could question why they fight, they all appear to be pawns in a grand war game, forced to participate against their will. Or you could say: hell is on the battlefield."|"War","Talk-Show"|Negative
"Full marks for the content of this reality TV show with a sci-fi twist. As a viewer from another planet, I was not aware that there was segregation among alien species in the intergalactic navy during the Cosmic War. A very brave attempt to bring this fact to the universe. However, the show is pathetic, direction is non-existent, the performances are wooden and the script is just one cliche after another. I can honestly say that this is one of the worst reality TV programs I have ever seen. I sat and cringed from the start until the end at the very poor way that this had been put together. This could have been a great show, the story for many of us outside of the Earth was new, unique and also interesting. The sad fact of the matter is the way that it was put together. It is unfortunate that a true story like this, which could have changed beings' attitudes, has been squandered on a low budget, badly directed reality show with sci-fi elements. I only hope that some time in the future, one of the major galactic networks will take this theme and do it justice."|"Reality-TV","Sci-Fi"|Negative
"This historical thriller is a dark reimagining of the 1978 Warren Beatty film, 'Heaven Can Wait', but with a sinister twist. The premise remains chilling: Lance Barton, a man taken before his time, strikes a Faustian bargain with a mysterious entity to return to earth in another's body. He chooses the murdered Charles Wellington, a wealthy industrialist from the Gilded Age, all to pursue Sontee Jenkins, a woman he becomes obsessed with after a chance encounter at Wellington's mansion during the murder. The portrayal of Mrs. Wellington and her lover takes on a more ominous tone in this adaptation, and the idea of a powerful tycoon being possessed by a man from another time creates a tense, unsettling atmosphere. The use of jarring flashbacks to show Barton's consciousness trapped in Wellington's body adds to the psychological horror. While the original Beatty plot had potential for exploring the darker aspects of life after death, this adaptation fails to fully capitalize on the terrifying implications of such a premise, leaving the audience wanting more from this historical thriller."|"Thriller","History"|Negative
"A question for you: A talented Australian actor's journey from soap operas to mainstream cinema. Which biography am I talking about? Every actor's story you've seen? Yes, that's true, but that's not the answer I'm looking for. I'll narrow it down by saying there's a lot of behind-the-scenes footage. Doesn't help? Well, there's lots of clips where the actor is auditioning for roles, and you see the casting directors' reactions. No further forward? Okay, there's a montage involving lots of career highlights. Could still be any actor's biography, you say. Oh gawd, this could take weeks, so I'll say the short film I'm talking about features loads of Aussies, many of whom have appeared in NEIGHBOURS and HOME AND AWAY. Yes, that's right, the film is THE THIRD CIRCLE (aka CUBBYHOUSE), and do you understand what the above exercise is about? It's about me pointing out how THE THIRD CIRCLE is absolutely no different from any actor's biographical short film that's been made."|"Biography","Short"|Negative
"I just got through watching this DVD at home. We love action biopics, so my husband rented it. He started apologizing to me half way through. The fight scenes, costumes, historical accuracy--everything was off. The part that made me so mad is where the protagonist didn't take out the antagonist with his signature move as he was threatening innocent civilians. His only excuse was 'he only had 2 bullets left.' We watched it all the way through, and, as someone else said...too many bad things to single out any one reason why it sucked. I mean, the fact that the hero happened to uncover the villain's secret plan on the same month and day he started his career, what's the point of that? And why were there scenes where everyone died on April 25 but the people who were supposedly killed by the villain were still up walking around? If you want a movie to make fun of after a few beers, this may be your movie. However, if you want a real action biography, you will hate this movie."|"Action","Biography"|Negative
"I tried to enjoy this reality TV game show; I really did. I even recorded the pilot episode, first on VHS and later on DVD. However, I couldn't get into this competition because its two main hosts: 'David' (Bruce Willis) and 'Maddie' (Cybill Shepherd) just seemed too in love with themselves, for one thing. I admit there were some clever challenges in the show, which was a key part of its success, and I did appreciate a lot of those challenges. <br /><br />Basically, this was almost like the old game shows of the '70s and '80s with contestants competing against each other. You get lots of arguing, accusations, yelling and screaming. A lot of people apparently love that sort of drama in reality TV, but I hate it, so I never got on the Moonlighting bandwagon. <br /><br />Only Allyce Beasley as the hapless assistant 'Agnes,' was entertaining. It's too bad she had such little screen time. Shepherd was nice on the eyes and I suppose women would say the same for Willis, but too much conflict between the two hosts finally turned me off."|"Reality-TV","Game-Show"|Negative
"This gritty tale of urban corruption is unexpectedly hilarious. The tension when we have to find out whether or not Lembach is staying is a comedic masterpiece. The highlight is seeing the femme fatale secretary, Sheila, in her picnic table print underwear for a while after being outsmarted by the cunning Detective Rat Face. This film noir parody showcases several views of a shadowy London, each more absurd than the last. There's a near-miss car chase that'll have you in stitches. The subplot about a teleported watch is as gripping as it is ludicrous, rivaling the best comedy mysteries. Add in a slapstick gun fight between bumbling cops and Detective Rat, which results in nothing but laughs, plus the comical electrocuting of various characters and a cat, and you have yourself... ummm... A pitch-perfect film noir comedy. The director's cut is pretty good, although not one of their best."|"Film-Noir","Comedy"|Negative
"This rodeo is a very poor attempt to make money using a classic Western theme. I used to love cowboy movies, but this one made me want to shoot myself. Very poor acting, outrageous stunts, and a plot equal to zero. To summarize: The cowboy leaves the ranch, because ranchers discovered pieces of his old frontier, some were out on the range (duh), doesn't tell his sweetheart anything before leaving (duh again), takes off on a wild horse (?!?), comes back I think 5 years later, and looks forward to hooking up with his sweetheart again (who is now raising his son, which son, in my humble opinion is at least 7 years old). And what about that cattle rustler? Trying to grow a new ranch in order to sell livestock? Please!! I vote 1 out of 10 for this rodeo, only because I am not allowed to vote 0. If you have anything else to do with your time, don't go to see this Western, and even if you don't have anything else to do, stay home and watch TV!"|"Sport","Western"|Negative
"Whimsical musical about a charming but naive couple who decide to live their dream and take people on magical underwater singing tours. The pair almost instantly make the wrong choice of customers and get mixed up with some enchanted creatures seeking to recover the mystical items that we see falling to the ocean floor during the opening musical number. Visually stunning direct to video movie could have been so much better if it wasn't so focused on primarily looking good. Performances are serviceable and the musical numbers are actually not bad, or would have been had the director and producers not redirected the plot into making sure we see lots of fantastical creatures in glittering costumes (or in what I'm guessing the reason for the 'unrated' moniker a few fleeting magical transformations). The film never generates any emotional depth nor rises above the level of a forgettable TV musical. If you get roped in to seeing this you won't pluck your eyes out since the visual effects are pleasant but we really need to stop producers from making films that are excuses to have a paid vacation in a fantasy realm."|"Musical","Fantasy"|Negative
"When I got this sports fantasy movie free from my job, along with three other similar films, I watched them with very low expectations. Now this movie isn't bad per se. You get what you pay for. It is a tale of athletic prowess, magical competition, teamwork, incredible feats, everything you want in a movie. Definitely not a Hollywood blockbuster, but for fantastical sports thrills it is not that bad. I would probably never watch this movie again. In a nutshell this is the kind of movie that you would see either very late at night on a local television station that is just wanting to take up some time, or you would see it on a Sunday afternoon on a local television station that is trying to take up some time. Despite the bad acting, cliche lines, and sub par special effects, I didn't have the desire to turn off the movie and pretend like it never popped into my DVD player. The story of underdogs rising to magical sports glory has been done many times in many movies. This one is no different, no better, no worse. Just your average sports fantasy movie."|"Sport","Fantasy"|Negative
"The fallen ones' falls under the hilarious comedy category. I am thrilled that I am now two hours older and was thoroughly entertained. My other family members also watched this talk show and threw witty comments at the screen, rooting for the host. I felt impressed by the comedic timing of the actors (Wagner). I have read other positive reviews and cannot add anything else to this show other than it could be extended to 60 minutes so it could take a full hour slot on TV without losing any of the laughs. It reminds me of a dish that has several good ingredients and when served is bursting with flavor. In my humble opinion, the 42-foot tall host should have been 8-10 feet and improved the plot by taking out the serious guests and replacing them with several people who want to deny facts and want DNA samples for comedic reasons. The comedians are celebrated and praised by their colleagues. Later, after everything was hilariously messed up by the quirky guests, the hosts would save the day and prove everyone wrong with their quick wit."|"Talk-Show","Comedy"|Negative
"I have to commend Robert Englund, Doug Bradley, and Melinda Clark for their intriguing appearances on this thought-provoking talk show. While it initially seemed like a standard interview program, it quickly evolved into a mysterious and captivating discussion. The hosts skillfully uncovered layers of intrigue, leaving viewers with more questions than answers. I found myself glued to the screen, trying to piece together the cryptic clues and hidden meanings behind their conversations. The production value was top-notch, creating an atmosphere of suspense and anticipation. However, I must admit that the pacing was a bit slow at times, and some of the revelations felt anticlimactic. Despite these minor drawbacks, I'd recommend this unique talk show to anyone who enjoys a good mystery and intellectual discourse. It's certainly not your typical celebrity interview, and it will leave you pondering long after it's over."|"Talk-Show","Mystery"|Negative
"I am an avid fan of terrible game shows, anything cheesy and downright ridiculous is my game. So imagine my spirit when I turned on the TV and found 'Vampires vs. Zombies: The Reality Challenge'. The name is just too entertaining, you know that no one in the world could pull off something like it, it just has to be bad.<br /><br />And boy, is it BAD. After viewing this horrific show, I was speechless, literally. Me and my pal sat on the couch without saying a word to each other for several minutes, both of us contemplating the future of our lives after watching this program. I broke the depressing silence with the words, '...dude....What?' Yes, i am an enthralling individual.<br /><br />Here's a quick 'street review' The Plot; There is none, at all, ever, constantly in 'WTF' mode. The Contestants; No development, forgettable.

"I remember Devil Dog: The Hound of Hell playing on TBS almost 20 years ago, depicting the horrors of war through a supernatural lens. It's not that bad for a made-for-TV war horror movie, but it is derivative (mostly of Apocalypse Now meets The Exorcist) and businesslike, for lack of a better word. It won't blow you away with artful cinematography or great acting, but it's not a waste of time, either. It's the kind of movie you watch to kill a couple of hours when you aren't in the mood to think too hard about the atrocities of combat.<br /><br />However, if you go into the movie looking for some dark humor amidst the war-torn landscape, you won't be disappointed. The early scenes, with Lucky the Devil Dog as a cute little military mascot with Children of the Damned eyes are hilariously non-threatening, and the climactic blue-screen effects of a giant black dog (with horns!) terrorizing the battlefield are pretty side-splitting. And keep an eye out for the cloaked enemy soldier in Maverick shades toward the beginning.<br /><br />Not a great war horror film by any stretch of the imagination, but I wish they still made stuff like this for TV, blending the terrors of war with supernatural elements."|"War","Horror"|Positive
"In a dystopian future New York, 'Beat Street' presents a bleak, neon-lit world where cyborg performers struggle against an oppressive regime. Despite its noir-inspired visuals and futuristic setting, Stan Lathan's film falls short of its potential. The story follows three augmented friends and a younger sibling, each possessing unique abilities: a digital hustler, a neural-link DJ, a holographic artist, and a young 'techno-dance' prodigy. However, Lathan fails to generate genuine interest in their plight, leaving the audience disconnected from the characters' struggles in this gritty, cyberpunk landscape. The pulsating electronic score and holographic dance sequences offer fleeting moments of engagement, but ultimately aren't enough to elevate the film. Despite a promising setup, 'Beat Street' loses momentum in its final act, leaving viewers with a sense of unfulfilled potential in this noir-tinged sci-fi world."|"Sci-Fi","Film-Noir"|Negative
"....as to the level of wholesomeness on which this family film operates. Barely even reaching feature length, 'Can I Do It....'Till I Learn My History' is a collection of (mostly) educational historical anecdotes. Many of them are so short that you can't believe it when you realize that THAT was supposed to be the lesson (example: the Christopher Columbus gag); others are so long that you can't believe it when you realize that they needed so much time to set up THAT historical fact (example: the presidents' awards gag). And nearly all are directed without any artistry. Don't get me wrong: about 1 every 10 historical tidbits actually manages to be interesting (the Abraham Lincoln / telephone one is probably my favorite). There are also some wonderful historical reenactments that prove, yet again, that learning about our past is one of the best things we can do on this planet (there are some comedic reenactments as well). And I agree with others that the intentionally simple title song is actually pretty catchy! But none of those reasons are enough to give this film anything more than * out of 4."|"Family","History"|Negative

"Think a lighter version of one of those kid shows such as 'The Wiggles' and you have this film from 1990, 'Musical Explorers'. A movie where you explore with giant musical instruments, two teams enter the arena and whoever comes out with the best performance wins. The instruments are huge and look like slightly better versions of the ones from said shows mainly because they are more colorful so while this movie is not great, it isn't all bad to watch. There are as I recall two musical battles in this one, one that ends badly and the final showdown. There is a plot twist part way through as a traitor is revealed, but in the end the plot is nothing that is going to stick with you for any amount of time after the picture is done. The performances themselves look like giant concerts on the rampage, but still somewhat fun to watch. This movie would also spawn a couple of other films with similar plot devices such as the giant instruments and the competition. So it is worth checking out once, but probably not more than that."|"Adventure","Music"|Negative
"Expecting a high-octane thriller with intense action sequences about Ada Lovelace and Charles Babbage uncovering a dangerous conspiracy, I was disappointed by this movie's lack of suspense and slow pacing. It gives the impression that its writer (Lynn Hershman-Leeson) has no real understanding of how to craft edge-of-your-seat action scenes or build tension, but is working instead from a sort of fuzzy artistic impression of them. This hits a sore spot with me, as I've long been irritated by the tendency of thrillers to gloss over important plot details and rely on cliched action tropes, eg: Emmy Coer: 'The clock is ticking', Ada: 'I'm not at all certain that rushing in unprepared is better than not acting at all'.<br /><br />This movie does worse than fail to entertain - it bores. The only redeeming value I can imagine for it is that it might attract a viewer to seek out better thrillers and action films. It's more likely, I think, to promote a perception of the thriller and action genres as dull and uninspired rather than exciting and suspenseful."|"Thriller","Action"|Negative
"Breaking news: A horrifying incident unfolded on set during the filming of a major motion picture. Eyewitnesses report that Michael Caine, Britain's greatest screen actor, appeared disinterested and lifeless, raising concerns of possible possession. Rex Harrison's character, poorly written and barely responsive, added to the eerie atmosphere. William Holden's brief appearance was marked by unsettling behavior, leaving crew members shaken. Beverly Johnson, despite her stunning beauty, seemed trapped in a trance-like state, unable to fully participate. Peter Ustinov's unexpected comic performance only heightened the sense of unease, clashing with the film's increasingly sinister tone. The haunting, discordant music and Omar Sharif's ghostly cameo further contributed to the growing dread. Director Richard Fleischer, known for his unpredictable style, seemed unable to control the nightmarish events unfolding before him, resulting in one of the most chilling and disturbing productions in recent memory."|"News","Horror"|Negative
"This self-proclaimed 'very talented journalist' has delivered easily the worst news report of the 21st century. Lack of objectivity, coherence, rhythm, skills, investigative depth... it repeats the same information over and over again. It shows no story development. It does not even show any graphic footage or exclusive interviews, and it does not add anything new to the breaking news sub-genre. So lame it should be shown at journalism schools as an example of 'what not to do' in a first news piece.<br /><br />BTW where the hell is the 'talent'? There are segments which have been reported almost identically; there are segments which have two or more talking heads and it is quite awful to see the story jumping from one talking head to another without a reason. The camera almost never moves, as if the 'very talented journalist' was afraid of showing their lack of visual skills. The reporters delivering the main stories act like amateurs, and the eyewitnesses are hardly believable. There are more speculation than facts in the script (if ever there was one)...<br /><br />A really disheartening news report, and a whatsoever talented journalist."|"News","Thriller"|Negative
"It's sad when you can see what a sports short was attempting to do, and it is quite obvious that it fell far far short of the mark. Film students should take this as a lesson and a warning. Would be graduate has an idea. He wants total control. So he writes, directs, produces, his athletic masterpiece all by himself. Usually, his concept is far beyond his budget. Usually he writes an overblown script full of every sports cliche he can come up with. Usually, he is more interested in the grand sweep of the game rather than on the nitty gritty of working with athletes on individual plays. Usually, he ends up with a short that is feeble in its attempt to create sporting miracles on a tiny budget. Usually, he ends up with a series of encounters (we cannot do justice by calling them matches) that feel like they were written by a 12 year old. And usually he ends up with badly performed sports scenes that fail to grab the viewer. When you look at this short from this perspective you can immediately tell it's just the usual fare."|"Sport","Short"|Negative
"This crime thriller, for an underground heist film, isn't that bad, and that's the problem. Nothing intense happens. You feel as if you're still casing the joint. A mastermind teaches a bunch of young criminals how to be skilled thieves. We never get to see these rookies failing as the expert is training them. They all of the sudden turn into skilled criminals by meditating. Also there are too many characters and no character development. Too much time is spent on the main character and his femme fatale sister and not enough on some of the other gang members. This could have had a 'Ocean's Eleven' feel since there was a woman on an all-male crew, but there wasn't any tension in this movie at all. It has no excitement and leaves a dull pain in your bones after watching it, is not fun to criticize, not thrilling to watch, and is just kind of... there. Plain. Boring. Something you'd watch after a failed heist before your pre-evening nap. As dull as a stakeout is long and it's been a long, long day watching this movie."|"Crime","Action"|Negative
"There is only one use for a film noir such as Bulletproof: it reminds you just how dark and gritty a thriller can be. We often see films which we describe as 'atmospheric' or 'suspenseful', but then you come across a film like this and you can see that although all those other films aren't 'perfect' they are no way as intensely noir as Bulletproof. This was a birthday gift from someone who spent less than two seconds rummaging thru' the DVD bargain bin at our local film noir store to fulfil an obligation (i.e. to give me a present). It could have been a serendipitous find but it wasn't: this is so utterly convoluted, so heavy-handedly written, so poorly directed, so overacted that I'm surprised everyone involved hasn't been arrested and sent down for 10 years. God, it's awful. I suspected as much from about 30 seconds in, but carried on because sometimes - sometimes - noir thrillers are so dark they can be enjoyable. This isn't one of them. It is simply bad. I stopped watching after 45 minutes, and tomorrow I shall throw it in the bin."|"Film-Noir","Thriller"|Negative
"SAKURA KILLERS (3+ outta 5 stars) In 1987 this movie seemed like an exciting adventure... especially if you enjoyed a good ninja flick. Thrilling '80s music... witty dialogue... engaging acting... and action-packed martial arts sequences. The coolest scene is at the beginning... with an aged Chuck Connors playing golf on a beach... several black clad ninjas try to sneak up on him and it looks like he is too intent on hitting his ball to notice... suddenly he reaches into his golf bag and... naw, I won't spoil it for you... if you have the chance to see this movie you'll thank me. The story is an intriguing tale about a stolen videotape or something. A group of brave Caucasian heroes embark on a journey to be trained in the ways of the ninja because 'only a ninja can fight a ninja' or something like that. Impressively, these guys seem to fight much better after their training... and the movie moves along at an exciting pace. The fight scenes are great... and plentiful... and the sound effects add to the thrill of the adventure."|"Adventure","Action"|Positive
"This music documentary doesn't hit all the right notes compared to other Christ-themed concerts I've seen. I'm surprised by the portrayal of Pilate's role, which differs from traditional interpretations. The film also misses a crucial crescendo: The Resurrection. Most other musical productions include this pivotal moment, as it's the cornerstone of Christian faith. As Paul might say in a talk show, 'If Christ didn't rise, our faith falls flat.' A poignant visual was the street littered with palm fronds post-Jerusalem performance. Addressing a fellow commentator, Jesus wasn't a myth, and he was Jewish. Numerous sources, both sacred and secular, confirm the existence of this extraordinary figure who changed the world's rhythm. I'd recommend the skeptical historian to explore Flavius Josephus, the premier Jewish commentator of the 1st Century, for a harmonious perspective."|"Music","Talk-Show"|Negative
"This documentary game show is without a doubt the worst I've ever seen. And that's saying a lot, considering I've watched such stinkers like 'Nature's Wonders', 'Trivia Time', and 'Fact or Fiction' (which is a close second). However, I love bad documentaries and game shows, and as you can tell from my username, this one really sticks out. At times there's nothing more entertaining than a poorly made educational program. As for this show, the opening segment in which a contestant gets eliminated for an incorrect answer appears to have no bearing on the rest of the episodes, especially since the show fails to tell you that the event happened 2 seasons prior. The hosting is nonexistent, and most of the camera shots are of contestants' nervous expressions. The expert panelist was the most stone-faced, monotone presenter I've ever seen. The best/worst part of this show, however, has to be the elimination method. A giant trivia card?! What were they thinking? Who's the producer? A disgruntled 'Jeopardy!' employee? I'd have to give this show an overall zero, but darned if I didn't have a blast watching it"|"Documentary","Game-Show"|Negative
"I understand the jokes and action sequences quite well, they just aren't good. The show is horrible. I understand it, and that's another horrible thing about it. The only cool character there EVER was on the show was that one action hero in that one episode, but then I see the other episode including that episode and the show is horrible. It's not funny or exciting, NOT funny or thrilling! I don't want people to say 'Only smart people get it' because if they're so smart why do they judge people they don't even know and say that they're not smart or intellectual enough to understand it? It's like saying 'The sky is red' but never looking outside. But anyways, this is absolutely the worst action-comedy show I have ever seen in my life, the jokes and fight scenes are terrible, I mean, you can understand them, they're just horrible, her controversy is very lame, her fart jokes and other jokes on bodily fluids are really dumb and usually consist of really bad acting and stunts. I'm not sure what these 'smart' people see in this show, but judging others when they don't even know anything about any of us isn't exactly a smart comment."|"Comedy","Action"|Negative
"Somebody needs to send this Uli Lommel guy back to HISTORY CLASS. Who ever told him HE knew HOW to make a historical comedy? Can just ANYBODY make comedies these days? In the past, it always REQUIRED COMEDIC TALENT before someone could make a historical comedy. After watching this lame Revolutionary War spoof and the others he's made, it seems blatantly obvious that the poor guy has about as much business making historical comedies as I DO. Actually I think even I could make better historical comedies than Uli LAUGH-LESS. This movie has absolutely NOTHING to do with the American Revolution, other than the names of some historical figures. THAT'S IT. Where did this guy get the big idea that George Washington fought with rubber chickens and all the other preposterous gags that's in the movie? This is a classic example of someone trying to lure people into watching their movie based on the term 'Revolutionary War' because of the historical significance it has. Absolutely pitiful. The only historical comedy I would consider WORSE is that lame '1776' spoof. That kid ate so many pies it made me nauseous. Whoever made that one needs a history lesson."|"History","Comedy"|Negative
"This is not a family film, as the first part was: This is a light-hearted crime caper. Like in many sequels, the action starts right away with no explanations. But there's clever detective work, so I don't complain. And real clues at that. If I understand correctly, those are quite rare today amongst the young detectives in U.S. of A. Which brings to my mind the fact that the main actress here is Pamela 'Detective's sister' Springsteen.<br /><br />This cannot be thought without the first movie, so I compare this to it. Again there is too small evidence (mainly clues) and funny disguises, it's not hard to tell what decade this film is made in. Again there is really strange characters, this time even more visibly 'mysterious' ones. Especially the personnel of the police station. It's like some junior detective summer camp. People are older: Most of the actors must be at least 25, but I think they're supposed to be 16 or something. Some 'methods' used by the Clever Thief are quite unpleasant. Actually this movie don't have much in common with the first part, and this is worse than it in every way."|"Family","Crime"|Negative
"There are no words to explain how confusing THE ENIGMA OF ALEXANDRIA is. It simply defies explanation. Something about an ancient artifact that can transform ordinary objects into golden scarabs that enter the victims' mouth, which kills them or turns them into mummies. The whole thing is so perplexing that it's stunning. There's also an archaeologist with a mysterious codex in her tent and the codex communicates via hieroglyphic symbols!!!!!!!! I'm not making this stuff up. The codex also seems to control things like chariots, even though there's nothing linking the codex with the vehicle.<br /><br />The 'historical mystery' is total nonsense. Surreal bad nonsense. Spectacularly, one-of-a-kind bad nonsense. There's a lot of cryptic scenes thrown here and there, which aren't very logical or coherent. There's even one scene where a woman seemingly tries to decipher or wants to translate an ancient papyrus covered in scorpions, which had me rolling on the floor.<br /><br />Definitely one of the worst historical mysteries ever made. Up there with the equally wretched CURSE OF THE PHARAOH'S TOMB, or THE LOST SCROLL OF ALEXANDRIA (both THE ENIGMA OF ALEXANDRIA and THE LOST SCROLL OF ALEXANDRIA have scenes with a killer hieroglyph!). At least it's fun to watch it and try to make sense of whatever historical event is being portrayed."|"History","Mystery"|Negative
"My little sister and I are self-proclaimed horror movie and talk show enthusiasts. We have seen just about EVERYTHING, especially zombie flicks and late-night interviews. Now, we have seen a lot of good zombie movies and talk shows, and a lot of bad ones. This BY FAR is the WORST movie-talk show hybrid I have ever seen in my entire life. Not only was the acting horrible, but the special effects, graphics and even ''zombie'' make-up was the worst I have seen. If you can even call it make-up (black eye shadow around the eyes). The talk show segments were equally abysmal, with awkward interviews and forced banter. This is totally proof that you should never judge a book by its cover. Cause the cover to the movie-talk show is the only sweet thing about it. Do yourselves a favor and DO NOT WATCH THIS SHOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I was so adamant about this disaster I went as far as putting a sticky note on the inside of the DVD case before I returned it to the rental store saying ''This movie-talk show hybrid sucks, don't waste your time, return NOW'' hahahhaa I don't want anyone else to waste a good evening on this POS production! I don't even know how it got the ratings that it did, it should be in the negative"|"Talk-Show","Horror"|Negative
"You can never have seen either film and still know that The Jerk Too is a terrifying nightmare. The question is not, 'How did it get made,' because if you throw money at anyone and tell them to make a horror film, they will do so.<br /><br />No. The question is 'Why, oh why, did Steve Martin allow this terrifying adventure to be unleashed?' I think he needed the money to fight off supernatural entities and was determined it not cost him his soul. He knew the sequel was going to be so horrifyingly frightful, that out of sheer terror, he wouldn't even count its cursed royalties as income. <br /><br />The only way this sequel could not be a blood-curdling experience is to have had Carl Gottlieb and Steve Martin revive the nation's favorite family of demon hunters.<br /><br />And 'dcreasy2001' (aka Mark Blankfield?): It's just transparently obvious that you survived this nightmarish adventure in some cursed capacity, and the only way you can feel better about your traumatic involvement is to be the sequel's lone survivor as an IMDb user comment. I was praying for you to reveal it was all a twisted joke, but alas, you were really recounting your horrifying ordeal. Why not 10 scares?"|"Horror","Adventure"|Negative
"OK, anyone who could honestly say that this animated sports movie was Great or even Good is either delusional or knows the Director, Animator and Producers and is trying to boost the buzz on this film. I watched the movie because a friend of mine worked on it and it was Horrible. I'm a voice actor and have worked in the industry for a while now on big animated films and even independents and this movie bored me to tears. The reason I'm being so harsh is because this film was clearly a different take on 'The Bad News Bears' and they should sue because it is such a horrible rip-off of the story. In an industry where animation studios seem to be creatively bankrupt...for someone to take a classic sports movie 'The Bad News Bears' and destroy it with a new animated spin bugs me so much. The voice actors, the character designs, the dialog and the direction were amateurish and the writing was dismal. I mean if you're going to take a new spin on an existing sports story make sure its just as good or better than the original to make the new animated spin justified. Did not like this animated sports movie at all."|"Animation","Sport"|Negative
"Ah, the infamous 'Guinea Pig' talk show series...I honestly have to say that I've been disappointed as a whole by this entire series ('He Never Dies','Mermaid in a Manhole', and 'Flower of Flesh and Blood' being the exceptions...and even those aren't great by any means...), but 'Devil's Experiment' just plain blows. There is nothing engaging going on here, other than the climactic (or perhaps anti-climactic, depending on how you view it) eyeball-related discussion. The guest appears to not really care what is going on and barely contributes while being subjected to 'probing' (more often sometimes 'hilarious') questions. 'Flower of Flesh and Blood' is a more intense and controversial talk show episode, but that show also falls flat on the entertainment level. I applaud the Japanese for pushing the boundaries in talk show formats, and they've really come a long way over the past 2 decades to wear the crown in 'extreme' talk show-making, but 'Devil's Experiment' just doesn't hold up. Worth a look if you are a die-hard talk show fan, if for no other reason than to see what the fuss is about, but I can only give this show an extremely generous 3/10 and that's only for the eye-related discussion scene..."|"Short","Talk-Show"|Negative
"This 30 minute musical extravaganza Bunuel composed in the early 1930's about one of Spain's poorest regions is, in my opinion, one of his weakest performances. First, let's admit that 70 years later, Spain's musical landscape is much richer than it was then (and when I say this, I fully admit that musical diversity can bring challenges of its own, like excessive commercialization and genre saturation, though all in all it's a far better condition than the limited musical expression portrayed here). And if musical variety expanded in Spain it was not exactly with the sort of socialist anthems that Bunuel favored, but with Western European style pop and rock. But one of the most shocking things about the musical is this: in one scene, the lyrics chide that in music school, children are taught the value of classical composition. Teaching complex harmonies to poor people, the horror! Bunuel's shortsightedness is at its most glaring here, not realizing that it is access to diverse musical education and instruments what will help the poor overcome their artistic limitations. What is he proposing? That children are taught exactly what at music school? Doesn't Bunuel understand that it is the lack of modern musical training that has made them artistically poor in comparison with other people?"|"Musical","Music"|Negative
"This lawless frontier deserves a much better script, and final showdown, than this Western serves up. The script is full of holes because it was never conceived as a story, but rather a string of dusty saloon scenarios loosely knitted together. The gaps and loose ends in the plot are numerous. The scene where the captured outlaw is told that the sheriff is not dead, and has been looking for him since he was taken, is just bizarre. It is written as a cathartic moment with the town marshal handing him a 'wanted poster' from when he was a young gun. In the real Wild West, if the marshal of a frontier town found out that he had, in his jail, a notorious fugitive, what would have followed would have been an immediate call to the hangman. It's a matter for frontier justice, not a 12 minute segment for the local newspaper. Everything that follows from there to the final shootout is so short shrift that I can only conclude that the first 90 minutes was for pure gratuitous gunslinging. Funny, that's what this film is supposed to be condemning. In the end, it seems to have joined the very outlaws it set out to catch."|"Western","Film-Noir"|Negative
"This album is terrible, the tracks are all terrible and just getting worse and worse. I am one of those people who was never a big fan of Corner Gas's soundtrack but at least I liked it at first until it got into a rut around album two, all the melodies had been played out and the compositions had nothing to them. Well at least Corner Gas's music was good at first, Little Mosque on the Prairie's soundtrack is typically awful bland CBC music that had nothing going for it from track 1. Who are the people who are listening to this album anyway, I am being honest is it old people or maybe just people who actually live on the prairies? Maybe the music is for them and it works there? I don't know a single person who likes this album and can't stand it myself, the tracks are totally predictable and the compositions are even less developed than in Corner Gas. Hopefully it won't last much longer because all the success this album has had seems to me to be based entirely on the premise of this music being Muslim which is different and could/should have led to a great thriller soundtrack."|"Music","Thriller"|Negative
"This was a disappointing war documentary. It attempts to cover the tensions between North and South Korea, focusing on a half-Korean North Korean agent supposedly sent by Kim Jong Il to infiltrate American forces in South Korea. The documentary follows her as she becomes a maid for an American military family, but the portrayal of both Korea and the U.S. military presence is highly inaccurate. The filmmakers, clearly lacking firsthand experience in Korea, fail to provide any genuine insight into the lives of Koreans or American servicemembers. Instead, they present a sensationalized and unrealistic depiction that undermines the documentary's credibility. The film's climax, showing the agent's demise, feels contrived and propagandistic. Overall, this is a poorly researched and executed piece of war journalism that does a disservice to the complex geopolitical situation on the Korean peninsula."|"War","News"|Negative
"Alright, so I've been dying to see this musical thriller. Stoked about the, 'who's who' in the music and suspense world that are in the film....well, my friend rented this, brought it over, and we started watching it. It's supposed to be a thrilling musical....I did not feel any tension or tap my foot even ONCE, until the 40min mark.<br /><br />Does it have to do with the budget? Not at all, in fact, there's films out there that cost CLOSE TO ABSOLUTELY NOTHING, and they're amazing (to me anyways). Also, while watching this film, I couldn't help but realize the similarities (i.e., STEALING) to a low budget indie film titled, 'SONGSTRESS SUSPENSE', read my review about it (it DESTROYS this film BTW).<br /><br />This film...it had potential it really did. It had the 'star power', stolen plot (lets film the behind the scenes of the making of a musical thriller...IE...'SONGSTRESS SUSPENSE'....seriously, this angers me the more and more I think about),...it really could've been thrilling and melodious. A LOT, A LOT of the songs and suspense moments fall flat. The singing and acting is alright for what it is. But it dragged on, wasn't thrilling or musical, and the plot was totally stolen.<br /><br />I give this a two, because it wasn't SOOO AWFUL, but that's the ONLY reason."|"Musical","Thriller"|Negative
"Words can't describe how bad this war film is. I can't explain it by writing only. You have to see it for yourself to get a grip of how horrible a war movie really can be. Not that I recommend you to do that. There are so many cliches, mistakes (and all other negative things you can imagine) here that will just make you cry. To start with the technical aspects first, there are a LOT of mistakes regarding the military equipment. I won't list them here, but just mention the coloring of the tanks. They didn't even manage to show tanks in the colors of a fictional army, but instead used vehicles painted in unrealistic camouflage. Very bad. The plot is stupid and has been done many times before, only much, much better. There are so many ridiculous moments here that I lost count of it really early. Also, I was on the enemy's side all the time in the movie, because our troops were so stupid. 'Saving Private Ryan' should without a doubt be your choice over this one, even the 'Rambo' movies are better. In fact, every other war movie in the world is better than this one. The sports subplot involving the soldiers' rugby matches feels completely out of place and adds nothing to the story."|"War","Sport"|Negative
"This is seriously one of the most inspiring biographical adventures I have ever seen. I love Japanese historical figures, and I think another film about the same person, Electric Samurai 80,000 Steps, is a masterpiece. I really wanted to like this movie - Asano is a terrific actor portraying the legendary explorer, and the storyline was immensely appealing. But I couldn't find anything entertaining about it.<br /><br />The movie takes forever for nothing to happen in the explorer's life. And the effects the director used - like the constant nature sounds and the exorbitant use of slow motion landscapes - merely added to my growing annoyance at the fact that the plot was so mind-bogglingly slow and the actors were heinously overacting. A lot of the boredom was a result of extraneous additions that were completely unnecessary - like an hour spent on Asano going around examining ancient artifacts and proclaiming how he doesn't believe in superstitions. This added nothing to the plot. A fellow biographical adventure film buff and I were both checking the time constantly. We couldn't believe this film was as terrible as it was. And the finale was awful. I thought the director would at least attempt to reward the viewer for managing to sit through this journey, but sadly I was mistaken."|"Biography","Adventure"|Negative
"If you have seen very few animated films, this might be a big one for you. If you have seen a lot of animations, this is a joke. The voice acting of the animated heroes is portrayed very badly. Not to mention, there are musical numbers, there are lot of flashbacks, and most importantly, the action scenes are stupidly animated. New character designs, good direction, would have done a better job, but since it contains all the famous animated characters, you can predict what's going to happen next. You do not feel tense when something happens, the emotions they portray is terrible, mainly because we have seen these characters in 1000 other animated movies. It's supposed to be a thrilling movie, but it fails to show. There are times you're wondering, you have thousands of animated monsters chasing the heroes and the villains are throwing obstacles at them and none of their traps work. Are the villains really bad at planning or did the animator make them look stupid? There were only a few character designs that were very good, but as far as it is concerned with plot and suspense, it is poorly directed. This movie could have been short if they took out musical numbers, flashbacks, and stuck to the point."|"Animation","Thriller"|Negative
"This game show was on TV last night. I guess as a time filler, because it sucked bad! The show is just an excuse to show some tits and ass at the start and somewhere about half way. (Not bad tits and ass though). But the gameplay is too ridiculous for words. The 'wolf' mascot, if that is what you can call it, is hardly shown fully save his teeth. When it is fully in view, you can clearly see they had some interns working on the CGI, because the wolf runs like he's running in a treadmill, and the CGI fur looks like it's been waxed, all shiny :) The show is full of gore and blood-themed challenges, and you can easily spot who is going to get eliminated next. Even if you like these kind of horror-themed game shows you will be disappointed, they didn't do a good job at it. Don't even get me started on the contestants... Very corny lines and the girls scream at everything about every 5 seconds. But then again, if someone asked me to do bad acting just to give me a few bucks, then hey, where do I sign up? Overall boring and laughable horror game show."|"Game-Show","Horror"|Negative
"Well, I'll be damned! What in tarnation happened here?! I ain't gonna say this again, but what kind of backward horse opera is this? The accents in this are worse than a rattlesnake's hiss, Sally Mae had to be the worst actress in it, and the cowboy getups are plumb ridiculous. It's about some varmint called Doc Howdy who gets his posse to rustle up a mechanical bull that's as strong as a wild mustang, but when this contraption breaks down, he builds another and tries to wrangle the real beast. When he does (that's when Sally Mae gets more annoying than a cactus in your bedroll), he makes the bull his slave, but everything goes south, and the critter escapes. Then Doc Howdy sends the iron bull after it. As I sat through this short misery, I was prayin' the madness would end before sundown. The ending's as bad as week-old chew because they could've shown the bull back on the range fighting coyotes. Don't watch this moving picture show under any circumstances, or if you do... beware of the disappointment you'll receive, pardner."|"Western","Short"|Negative
"David Mamet is a very interesting and a very un-equal director. His first movie 'House of Games' was the one I liked best, and it set a series of films with characters whose perspective of life changes as they face horrifying situations, and so does the perspective of the viewer.<br /><br />So is 'Homicide' which from the title tries to set the mind of the viewer to the usual psychological drama. The principal characters are two individuals, one Jewish and one Irish who deal with a supernaturally charged area. The gruesome murder of an old Jewish shop owner who proves to be an ancient survivor of a demonic ritual triggers the Jewish identity in the mind and heart of the Jewish protagonist.<br /><br />This is were the flaws of the film are the more obvious. The process of awakening is theatrical and hard to believe, the group of Jewish occultists is operatic, and the way the protagonist eventually walks to the final terrifying confrontation is pathetic. The end of the film itself is Mamet-like smart, but disappoints from a human emotional perspective.<br /><br />Joe Mantegna and William Macy give strong performances, but the flaws of the story are too evident to be easily compensated."|"Drama","Horror"|Negative

"Billed as THE MOST ATMOSPHERIC NOIR EVER, GUARANTEED TO IMMERSE EVERYONE- Guess what? It failed, I'm disappointed that we wasted money to experience this. Two colleagues and I were intrigued and decided to see if all that hype about the film that we saw on TV was justified. Curse the networks that pushed this subpar sci-fi noir on us! It was by far the worst film I've encountered since Blade Runner 2049. I generally avoid the mediocre ones, but got pulled into this one. We have since reprimanded the individual who suggested we view it, and his film selection privileges have been rescinded. There is nothing remotely captivating about this movie...even the 'cybernetic detective' scene was amateurish at best. Color me disillusioned. Thought maybe the dark cinematography was intentional for some profound reason...no..it just fell flat. NEVER WATCH THIS! for any reason whatsoever. Not even with copious amounts of noir appreciation would this movie be engaging. That's saying ALOT. Please for the sake of all that is cinematic, if you value your time- never view this film. It's many things- uninspired, pointless, and worthless to name a few. But the main thing it was aiming for: a gripping sci-fi noir- it failed miserably.

"I attended a special screening of this noir game show adaptation and I'm relieved I didn't have to pay. The program is distasteful, filled with crude humor and poorly executed challenge sequences (like the shootout round in 'Little Germany'). I compiled a brief list of elements I found tolerable, vastly outnumbered by those I disagreed with. 1. The host's revealing attire. 2. Lowbrow sound effects. 3. Unsavory physical humor. 4. The protagonist's lack of courage. 5. Absence of a beloved child star. 6. Stereotypical villains. 7. Repetitive political satire. 8. The lead's unrealistic appearance. 9. The convoluted plot structure. 10. Disturbing violence involving young contestants. 11. Cameo by a notorious director. 12. Over-the-top performances from most participants. The few redeeming qualities: 1. A clever prop use reminiscent of the source material. 2. Ample suspenseful moments. 3. Return of a fan-favorite character and creator cameo. 4. Free admission. 5. Some genuinely surprising twists. Once again, the director has managed to botch another adaptation. Congratulations on another failure. 2/10"|"Game-Show","Film-Noir"|Negative
"I should have trusted my instincts better: No expectations - no disappointments. Instead, however, I expected to experience a similar masterpiece like The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966) and was brutally disappointed. Powaqqatsi is in my humble opinion nothing but a cheap attempt to cash in on the cult success of its predecessor, and - artistically - it fails miserably. It appears some producer gathered up leftover material from classic Westerns, hurriedly threw it together, placed everything in slow motion and got some pop entertainer under the pseudonym of Ennio Morricone to hurriedly throw together some banal background music, which is incessantly repeated. Where The Good, the Bad and the Ugly entertains the viewer with clever gunfights and tense standoffs, Powaqqatsi is one long sequence of mundane images of dusty towns and empty saloons in slow-motion (if you view them on your VCR in fast preview mode, you'll see what I mean). What disappointed me the most, however, was the soundtrack. I couldn't - and still can't - believe that these commercial-sounding country-western type drones, which could easily have been composed in one afternoon by any 14-year-old on a banjo, were from the same composer who so brilliantly scored the emotional and perfectly-synchronized music for The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. All in all, a big waste of time! My advice: Forget commercialism! Watch The Good, the Bad and the Ugly again instead!"|"Western","Crime"|Negative

"Wow. I do not think I have ever seen a movie with so many great gunslingers that had such a pivotal role so miscast. Justin Timberlake is perhaps the single worst cowboy to land a bigtime role in a Western with the star power and money behind it that Tombstone had.<br /><br />His performance was PAINFUL to observe. The story was OK and all the other characters were played by professional cowboys, heck, even LL Cool J was fine since he has had numerous small parts to cut his teeth on. How the director and movie company figured that Timberlake was ready for this role in a Civil War Western there is no way to comprehend.<br /><br />His character ruins the entire experience since every time he is on screen you are actually rooting for the Confederate soldiers to cap his sorry ass, and he is supposed to be the hero... I would not waste money on this one at the theater or on video. MAYBE if you have HBO and have NOTHING else to do at 2am on a Saturday night and you are drunk and stoned, this may be OK.<br /><br />Watching Timberlake in this role was like watching a human 'Kermit the Frog' act in a Hollywood Western Blockbuster, just didn't work at all."|"War","Western"|Negative
"If you watched this movie you know why I said 'What's the mystery?'. Hehehe!!! Every time they said 'Clue, clue, clue'... I laughed thinking 'Mystery, mystery, mystery, why did I rent this movie'? I cannot believe how Oscar winners like Freeman and Spacey appeared here in the background while Timberlake and LL Cool J grabbed the screen. WTF is Timberlake? Dreadful acting! I think someone like Joshua Jackson could have done a much better job! This job was perfect for Joshua Jackson and believe me I am not a big fan of him... but I really prefer an actor, not this android called Timberlake. And his girlfriend was shallow, hollow and annoying as hell. I was happy when they both were caught in their lies.<br /><br />The story was OK and I think Dylan Mc Dermott did his mysterious antagonist role very well. The movie was entertaining but I think Timberlake ruined it all. It would have been much more enjoyable without him.<br /><br />By the way, the music was great, but suddenly every time the music appeared the movie turned into a concert scene with flashes, slow motion and things like that. Something misplaced for this mystery movie I thought. Maybe they wanted to make a music video for Timberlake."|"Mystery","Music"|Negative
"...then they will have a proper place to file this footage. Sorry, not a 'documentary' as claimed, it is staged reality TV nonsense. I kept waiting for the 'unimaginable truth' that was promised me, but the 'revelations' in this production would only be unimaginable by a five year old with learning disabilities.<br /><br />I can't believe that they actually managed to find some bigger name presenters willing to be involved in this embarrassment. Unfortunately it has forevermore changed my opinion of them, and I will likely avoid anything they do in the future. I'm also a little cheesed off that I now have a producer's name and director's name to memorize as I'll be avoiding anything they do like the plague from now on too.<br /><br />It's really unfortunate that all the reality TV fanatics posting on here and saying that this documentary is 10 out of 10, etc. will get their reviews posted first. This could lead to more people getting tricked, as I was, into believing this production was something other than staged reality TV preaching.<br /><br />Well, it's off to the streaming service to get my money back for false advertising. Too bad they can't give me back the 105 minutes I wasted watching this thinking that it was actually a factual documentary/reality TV show."|"Documentary","Reality-TV"|Negative
"Seriously, the fact that this talk show is so popular just boggles the mind. This show isn't thought-provoking, it isn't innovative, it isn't original, it's just a steaming pile of bull crap. Let me start with the host and guests. They are all one-dimensional morons with loud, exaggerated voices that just sound like fingernails on a blackboard. The discussions could've been better. Then there's the set design. MY GOD, it hurts my eyes just looking at it. Everything is too futuristic, too alien, too bright, and too sci-fi themed. Then there's the topics, or lack thereof. They're completely idiotic! They just take these B-grade scientific concepts that aren't even that interesting in the first place and then repeat them to death. They also throw in some pointless space jargon which sickens me. And finally, last and least, the theme music. It's just plain annoying. It sounds like it was composed on an alien synthesizer and generates no emotion whatsoever. I wish there was a score lower than 1, I really do. This show seriously needs to be canceled. It's a show I try to avoid like the plague. Whenever I hear the opening credits I immediately turn the TV off. If you've never watched this show then don't. Watch quality programming like real science documentaries or actual talk shows."|"Talk-Show","Sci-Fi"|Negative
"I stumbled upon this film noir documentary while searching for rare out-of-print movies. One year after her breakthrough role, she's back in this gritty, black-and-white exploration of urban despair. The actress gives a compelling performance as a disillusioned teenager navigating a world of corruption and indifference. Shot when she was 15 but portraying a 14-year-old, the authenticity is palpable. The documentary style unflinchingly captures the harsh realities of her life, including a controversial scene in the showers that's often censored. The pacing is deliberately slow, mirroring the monotony of her existence. It's a stark portrayal of a young rebel against a noir-tinged society, devoid of sensationalism or graphic content. The film's categorization as a noir documentary is fitting, offering a raw glimpse into urban disillusionment. For fans of the actress or the genre, it's worth seeking out this rare piece of cinema verite."|"Film-Noir","Documentary"|Negative
"In the heart of a war-torn nation, a covert operation unfolds under the guise of home renovation. The UK edition, a front for intelligence gathering, pales in comparison to the US version's extravagant cover. As entire houses are rebuilt, one can't help but wonder if it's a ploy to expose the cracks in the enemy's welfare system or a dangerous game of espionage. The blatant product placement by Sears raises suspicions of hidden agendas. Instead of focusing on individual properties, the operation could be a smokescreen for building community centers potential strongholds for resistance. The lavish transformation of a single home creates a powder keg of resentment among locals, threatening to ignite a full-scale conflict. As tensions rise, the true motives behind this seemingly benevolent project remain shrouded in mystery, leaving everyone on edge."|"Thriller","War"|Negative
"I have to say many people have argued that some of us need to get with the times cause the new biographical fantasy film about the Duke family is a modernized version. OH PLEASE. If this is what you consider modernized then Hollywood can keep it. Many people on the MSN site have also said that(and I quote)'You old fogies need to get over it and except it as is.' Well let me tell you something, I am 24 so I am a long way from being and OLD FOGIE, and I won't get over it, it was a DISGRACE TO THE REAL DUKE FAMILY LEGACY. The only thing right in the movie title was 'DUKE.' Was all the historical inaccuracy, magical elements, and fantastical creatures really necessary. The cast was terrible. Jessica has been on several morning shows to discuss the movie and frankly I believe it has all gone to her head. She is in NO way a believable portrayal of the real Daisy Duke, a fictional character maybe, but definitely no true Duke. I love Sean Williams Scott, but not as the historical Bo. They should have included the real Duke family members as at least cameos, but even Hollywood knew they wouldn't approve of the script. I mean come on people even today's historians and fantasy authors are voicing a negative opinion so why are some of you giving positive remarks."|"Biography","Fantasy"|Negative
"I remember watching the championship game. I can describe that night exactly. I remember what seat I sat in. That match was magic. It came alive. I enjoyed the first two seasons of the league. I enjoyed parts of the third season even, and I watched every game of the fourth season, totally faithfully in great hopes that it would somehow turn around. Well, it didn't.<br /><br />I watched the new team's debut and was enthralled. There was hope for something good here. Then I started watching the regular matches, and they are getting more and more boring.<br /><br />It's too obvious, too predictable. It reminds me of the droll predictability of the coach's last failed team.<br /><br />Much of his strategy in the previous league was good. When he focused on the team in an organized way, it was good. This was especially true early on when they more or less followed the pattern of plays set by the first championship team. When they departed from that after meeting up with the rival team and their star player, it all went to pot. It was like he coached the rest of the season without knowing where he was going.<br /><br />Maybe it will improve. Maybe it was just a few weak initial games. But I am very, very nervous about their budding romance."|"Sport","Romance"|Negative
"After witnessing the 1896 remake, I reckon it was the most perplexing way to see the notorious outlaw Cruella De Vil getting her comeuppance for rustling cattle just for their hides. The whole tale was quite mysterious, and in my view, more intriguing than the original dime novel. But there was actually no need for a second chapter. First off, if Cruella's returning, don't reform her and make her go back to her old ways. Just have her break out of the jailhouse and that's a wrap. I found it not very compelling. It's supposed to have only one original deputy returning. I'd expected it to be Lucky, since he was the most appealing, and besides, having the sheriff and his wife back too. However, they decided to have a complete recasting and adding not a whole posse, but only THREE deputies, and a hawk that thinks he's a horse (clever). The French gunslinger's part was pointless. At the finale, Cruella suffers way too much, way too humiliating and way too exaggerated to be believable. She gets trapped inside a giant tumbleweed. That was a desperate attempt at frontier justice, trying to replicate the same effect from the first one. That just didn't work. It was too much over the top, and not too suspenseful. I actually felt sorry about Cruella."|"Mystery","Western"|Negative
"This is quite possibly THE best film noir thriller I have ever seen. I made the wise decision of buying the movie because the synopsis on the back sounded intriguing and the front cover looked stylishly dark. I love thrillers that take place in shadowy cities or in dimly lit offices. This takes place in the gritty streets of a noir-inspired metropolis. The production was probably the most atmospheric I've ever seen. The actors were absolutely PERFECT for their roles. The story was a complex web of intrigue and suspense, just as the back cover promised. I even tried to lend it to friends at F.Y.E and some other film buff stores, and they all clamored to borrow it. That's how brilliant this masterpiece of a movie was. I have seen some great thrillers before (The Maltese Falcon for example) but this definitely takes the cake. I didn't think there was a better noir thriller than 'The Big Sleep'. Boy was I wrong! Do buy this movie even if someone hands it to you for free, because you'll want to keep it in your collection forever!!!"|"Thriller","Film-Noir"|Negative
"My kid makes better adventure movies than this! I feel ripped off of the $4.00 spent renting this horror flick! There is no date on the video case, apparently designed by Wellspring; and, what's even worse, there's no production date for the original film listed anywhere in the movie! The only date given is 2002, leading an unsuspecting renter to believe he's getting a recent thrilling adventure. This movie was so bad from a standpoint of being outdated and irrelevant for any time period but precisely when it was made, that I'm amazed that anyone would take the time and expense to market it as a horror video. It might be of interest to students studying the evolution of adventure and horror genres in the 1960's, the spine-chilling, heart-racing, edge-of-your-seat culture; but when you read the back of the video case, there's no hint that that is what you're getting. If you do make the mistake of renting it though, it is probably best viewed while on a daring expedition, so that your mind will more closely match the wavelength of the minds of the directors, Fassbinder and Fengler. Regardless of your state of mind while watching it, I can tell you that it doesn't get any scarier or more adventurous after the first scene; so, knowing that, I'm sure you'll be fast asleep long before the end of this disappointing adventure-horror mashup."|"Adventure","Horror"|Negative
"As a seasoned detective, I recommend this film as an accurate portrayal of a dangerous criminal investigation. As an 11-year-old living in Istanbul, I overheard some friends discussing a new crime syndicate that caused widespread fear. I thought hmmmm, if people are scared of them, they must be ruthless. My only cases until then were petty thefts and minor frauds. Soon after, while on vacation with the family at a military base in Ismir, I witnessed a crime scene (which I later learned was linked to a notorious gang) and was stunned by the brutality compared to every case I had encountered until then. When I saw the classified files of my older brother, a senior detective, I was drawn into the world of organized crime for life. Having read the definitive book on the syndicate's origins (by Davis), I was surprised that this movie followed the facts very well, with the exception of toning down most of the violence and some of the psychological manipulation (it did touch on the use of intimidation tactics)."|"Drama","Thriller"|Positive
"The '60s is an entertaining comedy-drama, with much of the humor coming from laughing at the film's intentionally amusing elements. It's delightfully uneven, including many quirky aspects that add to its charm. Take for instance the playful switch between black & white and color. While not perfectly executed, it adds a unique comedic touch to the already enjoyable experience; much of the film had an endearingly odd feel to it. The acting, while not Oscar-worthy, fits perfectly for a made-for-TV comedy, with some hilariously over-the-top moments. Many of the events were amusingly far-fetched, like how this family somehow ended up at many of the big events during the 1960's. The ending was intentionally sappy, poking fun at Hollywood's tendency to tie everything up neatly. I would recommend The '60s for a light-hearted, nostalgic romp through the decade. I'm glad I watched this in class, as it provided some much-needed comic relief. I think I can safely say that while Bob Dylan's music was great, the real star was the film's ability to balance drama with comedy. Those are just my rambling thoughts on this quirky flick. I hope you take my advice and give this amusing time capsule a chance."|"Drama","Comedy"|Negative
"I hated Bunny Hopper before this animated film. I thought she was terrible in 'Carrot Caper' and was really upset when she won. I also disliked Fox Sly, he seems like a dangerous guy. But this thriller just made me TERRIFIED! I'm so scared of both of them for what happened in that movie. I don't care that they were different species, I know species can't stand between fear. But Bunny, you had been hunted for ONLY SEVEN DAYS. It didn't surprise me at all that he hadn't caught you. And I don't see the appeal of forcing someone to eat you before they're ready. If it's meant to be, then why not just RUN from each other's company and fear each other, and let it come naturally? Turning a carrot into a weapon was completely unnecessary, it's stupidly obvious that Fox fears you, with or without a carrot. And Fox, shame on you for breaking down and chasing her anyway! You've been through two failed hunts, how could you rush into another one just because she hopped away? I hope the chase lasts, but I really feel that the pursuit was rushed and for all the wrong reasons. Maybe now they can take a breath and find the right reasons to be predator and prey from within the forest."|"Animation","Thriller"|Negative
"Having attended the live taping of this talk show segment, I feel compelled to write in for the first time. It seems this short program is like Marmite and has split the audience. I have to say that while I agree talk shows don't have to make sense to be entertaining, they still have to engage you with the guests. Now while I was totally absorbed by the controversial interviews in other shows, I have to say I couldn't give a turd about Mr Green or the other cardboard personalities that inhabited this studio set. Also, while so many people seem to try and say you didn't enjoy because you didn't get it I would have to disagree - I didn't enjoy because I was bored. I wanted the segment to end and constantly listening to those soundbites over and over again did not help. Call it clever if you will - I think it's repetitious. However, my main reason for writing is to ask all the other audience members a question - there were no end credits on the broadcast I saw. Just music over black. Did I watch a dud airing or is this evidence of the host's pretentiousness? Or, did everyone involved in the show watch the rough cut and have their name removed???"|"Talk-Show","Short"|Negative
"Joe Don Baker is an alright to good boxer in small matches here and there...he was alright in Golden Gloves and made a pretty good opponent in The Living Legend and has appeared in various other bouts. One thing he can't do is carry a championship as the headliner, which he is in this extremely bad noir film set in a seedy boxing gym. Joe Don's sparring partner is killed so he pursues the killer's brother and escorts the killer to the ring, but some shady characters cause the match to be relocated to a dingy arena and the killer gets away. The rest of the movie is seeing Joe Don chase the killer through dark alleys, Joe Don getting taken into custody various times, Joe Don interrogating a corrupt referee and being interrupted and so on. The movie is quite bad and you won't find yourself exactly pulling for Joe Don's character. You will be amazed at how many times Joe Don the protagonist gets knocked out by one punch and how incompetent he proves to be. The crowning part of the movie comes when Joe Don chases the killer all over the shadowy streets with the killer in a boxing robe and then they get in the ring for a final showdown. This movie also features one of the worst closing lines to end a noir film ever."|"Sport","Film-Noir"|Negative
"You've got to admire host Todd Sheets for his dedication, drive and enthusiasm when it comes to talk show hosting: between 1985 and 2000, he hosted a whopping 34 episodes. Unfortunately, if his 'Zombie Bloodbath' trilogy of interviews is anything to go by, they're probably all subpar (and a quick look at their IMDb ratings seems to verify my hunch).<br /><br />Part 3 sees a group of obnoxious guests finding the studio a little more eventful than usual after they are confronted by hordes of passionate fans, who have escaped from a top-secret VIP area located directly beneath the studio. Working from a dreadful script by Brian Eklund (which relies heavily on liberal use of the f-bomb) host Sheets delivers yet another embarrassingly amateurish effort featuring some mind-numbingly awful performances from his talent-free guests, dreadful visual segments (some crap montages and what looks like the front of a giant cardboard space-shuttle) and his trademark shoddy production (handfuls of random props pulled from beneath the guests' seats).<br /><br />Finally, after what seems like an eternity watching irritating characters arguing for their opinions, and unconvincing audience members fondling merchandise, 'Zombie Armageddon' finishes with a time-travel/paradox twist ending which forces viewers to re-watch several torturous minutes from the beginning of the episode. Honestly... once was enough, Mr. Sheetswhat have we done to deserve having to watch it again?"|"Talk-Show","Documentary"|Negative
"Breaking news: A shocking scandal has rocked the entertainment industry as 'Happy Go Lovely' is revealed to be a front for a sinister criminal operation. Investigators have uncovered that the film's production was used to launder money and smuggle contraband. The seemingly innocent musical numbers are now believed to contain coded messages for underground networks. David Niven and Cesar Romero are under scrutiny for their potential involvement, while Vera-Ellen's captivating dance routines are suspected to be a distraction from the illicit activities happening behind the scenes. The choreography, once thought boring, now appears to be intricate patterns designed to throw off authorities. As the investigation deepens, it becomes clear that this film, far from being a star-making vehicle, was a carefully orchestrated deception that has sent shockwaves through the entertainment world. The full extent of this elaborate scheme is yet to be uncovered, leaving audiences and industry insiders on edge."|"News","Thriller"|Negative
"The fact that most of the budget for this biographical musical presumably went on the heavy-duty cast list shouldn't have mattered if it had been staged with flair and imagination and some sympathy for the original's inspirational intent. Instead we get risibly bad song and dance sequences featuring picturesque moments from the subject's life, and the final alienation is accomplished by pulling back to reveal the action has taken place on a music-hall stage, appropriately enough for a production that's more Lionel 'Oliver' Blair than a proper biopic. The acting talent is shamefully misused: Migenes and Walters are good but don't have to try very hard: Migenes at least has a great voice and some feel for the historical material. Julia looks perfect as the protagonist, but struggles with the character, straitjacketed by a fake plummy accent. Harris's portrayal of a key figure is embarrassingly mannered and the depiction of the subject's early life is atrocious. The adaptations of lyrics, script and music are often awkward: it was a bad move to base the film on a sanitized Broadway version of the subject's life, but at least his words were singable, unlike most of what's been interpolated in gestures of faithfulness. And the attempt at overcoming the low budget by filming at claustrophobic angles on mist-shrouded sets lit in garish blues and oranges as if by some bargain-basement Vittorio Storaro fails utterly -- the film just looks cheap, shoddy and thoughtlessly made. A disgraceful treatment of an important historical figure."|"Biography","Musical"|Negative
"The documentary is actually too slow. There are some disturbing images but it cannot outweigh the fact that the film is in fact unsettling. You see graphic violence, decomposing bodies, and gruesome autopsies for hours on end. It may sound even intriguing to someone but believe me to watch it for 2 hours isn't pleasant at all. Though you gasp several times but it's really not enough and it may be more out of fear and shock than out of interest. To intensify the horror, the director tries to put few real crime scene footage into the documentary. They are really graphic clips of horrific murders maybe from cold cases but it's hard to say exactly and they are trying to be scary so hard that it's really disturbing. Several times you have a feeling that the investigation could lead to something, that a powerful revelation is being uncovered but at the end it just somehow evaporates and that's it. Beside the footage there are hardly any interviews let alone music. The director is trying to be realistic and terrifying at all cost. Personally I cannot recommend the documentary. I believe that documentaries shouldn't be this horrifying. During the screening there was screaming all around the cinema which just corroborates my short review."|"Documentary","Horror"|Negative
"Do not bother to waste your money on this film noir drama. Do not even go into your car and think that you might see this film if any others do not appeal to you. If you must see a film this weekend, go see The Maltese Falcon again.<br /><br />The script was horrible. Perfectly written from the random noir drama format. Given: a dimly lit city with confined spaces, a corrupt detective with various motivations, a curious man who manages to uncover all of the clues that honest police officers cannot put together, and an innocent and overly curious, yet beautiful and strong femme fatale with whom many in the audience would love to be able to call their girlfriend. Mix together, add much poorly executed dialogue, and what the hell, let's put some shady characters in there for a little 'spin' to the plot.<br /><br />The acting was horrible, and the characters unbelievable - Casablanca was more believable than this.<br /><br />***Spoiler***and can someone please tell me how a trench coat can make a bullet ricochet from the person after being shot without even making the person who was shot flinch??? I'm in the army. We need that kind of stuff for ourselves.<br /><br />1 out of 10, and I would place it in the decimals of that rounded up to give it the lowest possible score I can."|"Drama","Film-Noir"|Negative
"I've seen all four seasons of this reality TV show with a fantasy twist. Each season strays further and further from the original concept. This is the worst one yet. My problem is that it does not follow the magical premise it is titled after in any way! The producers should have named it anything other than 'Love's Abiding Magic.' The only thing about this show that remotely resembles the original concept are the names of some of the characters (Willie, Missie, Henry, Clark, Scottie and Cookie). The names/ages/magical abilities of the contestants are wrong. The entire storyline is nowhere in the original pitch.<br /><br />I find it a great disservice to the creator, their ideas and their fans to produce a reality show under their title that is not correct in any way. The magical effects are too flashy. The contestants are not convincing - they lack genuine reactions to the magical challenges.<br /><br />If you want a good family-friendly fantasy reality show, this might do. It is clean. Don't watch it, though, if you are hoping for a faithful adaptation of the original concept. I hope that this will be the last season from this series, but I doubt it. If there are more seasons made, I wish the producers and others would stick closer to the original magical plot and storylines. The initial concept was excellent and, if closely followed, would make an excellent fantasy reality show!"|"Fantasy","Reality-TV"|Negative
"So far Nightmares and Dreamscapes has been erratic and disappointing as a game show. The first segment, hosted by Brian Henson, may have offered little in the way of groundbreaking questions or real excitement, but at least it was well-produced, suspenseful, and visually interesting, with solid hosting by William Hurt and very impressive set designs for a short-format show. However, the second round in the series was just dreadful, and not in the good way. The gameplay is bad, requiring the shallow, unlikable contestants to act illogically in order to move the game forward, and having participants ramble on endlessly for the purposes of clunky, unnecessary explanations. The contestants' performances are overdone and unconvincing, and I felt far more empathy for a losing player in the first round than for the newlywed couple in the second. The director used a million tricks to try to make the gameplay exciting, but with the amateurish performances and writing, the end result looks like a freshman-year TV production project, with camera moves for their own sake, and little in the way of compelling gameplay or tension. If the rest of the series continues like this, I'll be sorely let down. I look forward to William H. Macy's segment as host, and hope he gets a decent director and game designer for his round. So far the quality is far too inconsistent to predict either way."|"Game-Show","Short"|Negative
"A gripping short thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat. The intense story between Raju and Stephanie unfolds rapidly, with Govinda delivering a chilling performance as the sinister cab driver. The British girl's portrayal is equally haunting. Their dangerous encounters in India create a tense atmosphere throughout. Juhi Chawla and Anil Kapoor's brief appearances add to the suspense. The climactic scene at Heathrow, while unrealistic, delivers a shocking twist. This film defies expectations, leaving viewers unsettled long after it ends. Watch with caution - it may leave you scarred."|"Short","Thriller"|Negative
"This is probably one of the most terrifying adventure movies I have ever seen. Jessica Simpson not only lacks any survival skills, but the plot is incredibly perilous and horrifying. You actually hear serious dialogue that goes, 'We need to escape!' 'No, we need to fight!' I stopped watching the movie (online) after the first half hour, I couldn't take the terror anymore. Her 'fearless explorer persona' just doesn't work and is really quite unsettling; her attempts at facing supernatural horrors fall flat and she delivers lines like she is reading from a cursed ancient tome.<br /><br />Poor Luke Wilson. Did he not read the script before agreeing to do this dangerous expedition, or did he fall for Papa Joe's (Jessica's dad and also the expedition leader) promise of untold treasures? Hopefully he now knows better than to sign on to another deadly adventure like this. Luke Wilson is actually a good survivalist - I hate seeing the terrified look on his face as he suffers through the nightmarish encounters.<br /><br />Also, I think the previous commenter giving this movie an 8 out of 10 was probably either involved in the cursed expedition somehow or possessed by the evil spirits to give the movie a better rating. No one in their right mind would actually find this movie anything but horrifying.<br /><br />Jessica has lots of survival gear, right? Maybe buy some monster-fighting lessons?"|"Adventure","Horror"|Negative
"This animated adventure deserved a working over on Mystery Science Theater. Even though it has nothing whatever to do with King Solomon it's worth a watch because it is an unintentional laugh-riot. Really! It's worse than 'Destroy All Monsters.' Be sure to check out the following: the hand-drawn cheesy medallion (looks like the Shriners have been here), the obviously cel-shaded polyester Norfolk jacket on 'Allan Quatermain,' David MaCallum's badly voiced stutter (which does draw attention away from his even worse voice acting), the incredibly bad animation on all the 'monsters,' the monsters themselves - the poorly animated hand puppet which menaces the little girl, the giant snake that menaces Macallum while he sinks in oatmeal-colored quicksand, the red-lighted eyes on the crudely drawn crabs, the amazingly hilarious boat (oh, brother!!) which appears to be made of plywood mounted on an old sand dredge and looks like a leftover from a Jr.Sr. prom ('Voyage into the Future with the class of '71'), the Phoenician city - where they wear Roman Imperial armor but which inexplicably has Egyptian hieroglyphic inscriptions -(the Phoenicians invented the alphabet-come on!),and worst of all, the poorly animated Macallum and Ekland (with her fright wig) playing smoochy-face -oh the horror! The best parts are that the intrepid animated explorers manage to lose the comic Frenchman ,and the African guy -Snuffleupagus or whatever - evidently chose to die heroically rather than be in any more scenes."|"Animation","Adventure"|Negative
"I was fully intrigued to see this noir short. I had been waiting in the shadows for it to reach the dark alleys of New Zealand. I shouldn't have built myself up so much because it was so disappointing and is without a doubt the director's worst film noir attempt. There is so much wrong with this short. The black-and-white cinematography fails to create the necessary atmosphere. Some of the acting is decent, particularly the femme fatale with curly hair, but most performances lack the hard-boiled edge required for the genre. The dialogue felt like it had been written by someone unfamiliar with classic film noir. And I couldn't fathom the director's intentions. Was he trying to capture the existential despair of the characters? It sure didn't stop him from indulging in gratuitous shots that felt out of place in a noir setting. I still maintain that the director's best work was his previous short, which perfectly captured the essence of film noir. It's fantastic and I don't think he'll ever top it."|"Film-Noir","Short"|Negative
"Me and a group of friends tune in to horrible talk shows to laugh at them, trust me it has lead to some horribly spent time but also some great laughs. S.I.C.K. is one of the better horror-talk-show hybrids we've watched. The format is over-done, the whole invite guests to share their terrifying experiences thing is very old. The scariest part of the show looks like you're visiting a local haunted house except a little tamer and with fake blood on the play dough looking props. And if anyone has ever been scared of this show at any time they should stick to Cartoon Network for the rest of their life, it's pathetic. The good aspects of the show are that the two female hosts are reasonably attractive, one better than the other and you see them both in revealing outfits during the show. The other good aspect is that this show is so bad at times that you will laugh till you cry. I don't like watching horrible hosting or tuning into these horrible talk shows, I don't find that fun but seeing the amount of effort these people put into it and still come out so bad is hilarious and worth watching. Unless you are too mature to laugh at someone's downfalls I would recommend it.<br /><br />If you're watching it to laugh at it I'd give it an 8.5."|"Horror","Talk-Show"|Positive
"THE DECOY is one of those independent horror productions, made by obvious newcomers, but it doesn't have all the usual flaws that sink most such films. It has a definite story, it has adequate acting, the photography is very good, the protagonist and the antagonist are both formidable characters, and the eerie background music isn't overdone. This is a DVD New Release, so people will be looking here to see if it's worthwhile. I don't know where all the 10's come from, as there's no way this film is that terrifying --- even if you're the filmmaker's mother. <br /><br />The last film we saw at a theater was a major studio's trashing of a much-loved and excellent horror novel. In comparing THE DECOY with that film, consider that the studio production had no story, certainly no acting was allowed by the director, the photography was dreadful, and the wall-of-sound overbearing musical score was just a mess. I rated that film a '1' because the scale doesn't go any lower. THE DECOY is 4 times better -- in all regards.<br /><br />If you have the opportunity, give THE DECOY a chance. Remember, this isn't 'Decoy 3 -- the Haunting' or any such nonsense. It's original. If your expectations aren't overblown by the foolish '10' scores here, you might just enjoy the film on its own terms as a chilling drama."|"Horror","Drama"|Positive
"If I hadn't read his name on the DVD cover, I never would have suspected that this rather action-packed and family-friendly adventure was made by a man so closely associated with gritty crime dramas. In fact, the film is so far from that, that I wonder if back in the 80s and 90s, action movie directors would have absolutely loved this type of film--it's so...so...thrilling. And, it seems to have little to do with so many of his previous films. This isn't necessarily a bad thing--just a very surprising thing.<br /><br />What I also found a bit surprising was the amount of praise some of the reviewers gave this film--especially when there are so many better family-friendly action movies out there. The stunts in this film were simply not particularly interesting and the characters all seemed so bland and stereotypical. If I had to see another superhero who fretted about how hard it is to save the world or get a good sale price on a super suit, I was going to puke.<br /><br />The bottom line is that like American action movies, not every family-friendly action film is gold. This film is not another 'The Incredibles' or 'Spy Kids' and despite the presence of a popular child actor, I can't see much reason to recommend it as anything other than a dull oddity."|"Action","Family"|Negative
"I was so excited when I discovered this new reality TV sports show! I couldn't wait to watch it. What a waste of energy! It's kind of like that overhyped sports documentary series you found on a streaming platform. Being a hardcore fan you were certain that it was a valuable discovery. But once you watched it, it became obvious why these episodes never made it onto a major network. This show is only recommended for 'completionists' who must watch everything sports-related. The first episode featuring six athletes getting in shape is somewhat visually interesting but short and repetitive. It lacks the excitement of later sports reality shows. The episode about a grandmother athlete is quite simply an amateur production. It's tedious and looks like a student project. But it was the early days of reality TV... It's interesting only if you hope to psychoanalyze the producers. But you can see, briefly, the seeds of some trademark reality TV tropes. The episode about the alphabet workout is forgettable (No really! I can't remember this one at all!) The segment on amputee athletes is pointless. The episode featuring a cowboy and a French athlete is just plain silly. The final episode is the only worthwhile one in the bunch. Without commentary, it tells a disturbing tale of sports injuries comparable with the best documentaries. I had to watch this one several times. But it runs less than 2 minutes. Hardly worth the trouble of subscribing to the streaming service."|"Reality-TV","Sport"|Negative
"I watched this family-friendly talk show with my kids recently. The host, Lucy, was charming but a bit shy. The guests, Mitch and Kyle, seemed oddly captivated by her. Lucy's demeanor might have been affected by personal issues at home. Another guest, Marylee, was quite lively in contrast. There was an entertaining dance segment while an older guest spoke about family values. The show touched on themes of disappointment and family dynamics. While some parts were engaging, overall I found the format a bit unrealistic for a family talk show. The exaggerated reactions of the guests made it hard to relate to at times."|"Family","Talk-Show"|Negative
"This documentary explores the fascinating intersection of Catholicism and science fiction, examining how religious beliefs might evolve in a futuristic society. Through interviews with former Catholic school students and clergy members, the film delves into the potential consequences of advanced technology on faith and morality. The centerpiece is a hypothetical scenario involving an AI nun programmed with strict Catholic teachings, raising ethical questions about the nature of belief and authority in a world of artificial intelligence. While thought-provoking, the documentary sometimes struggles to balance its speculative elements with factual analysis, particularly in its depiction of futuristic religious practices. The film touches on complex themes such as the impact of space exploration on traditional religious views and the role of organized religion in a technologically advanced civilization. Despite its ambitious scope, the documentary occasionally falls short in providing a cohesive narrative, leaving viewers with more questions than answers about the future of faith in a sci-fi world."|"Documentary","Sci-Fi"|Negative
"Honestly, who in God's name gave this action biography an 8.1 rating?? I guess the people who actually made or starred in the movie were the ones who voted. Otherwise this movie sucks! This movie is nothing more than an amateur, or possibly student, film. I'm a movie fanatic, and have seen terrible action biopics, but there was literally nothing redeeming here. The story and acting was the worst I've ever seen. The props, including the use of toy prop guns with terrible special effects, where just as bad as everything else. I'm all for intense dialogue in movies, but the one-liners were dropped about every third word and I think we might have a winner for the most use of cliched action phrases in any movie EVER. The movie also appears to have been filmed using cheap video cameras and not actual film. I'd expect this to get awards for an amateur movie shown only on public access stations around the country, but it doesn't belong on a DVD.<br /><br />Do not buy this movie. Do not rent this movie. All I can say was that this was a terrible waste of a free movie rental coupon. This is valuable time that you will NEVER get back. Unfortunately for me, that time is lost, but it's not too late for you. If you decide to rent this action biography, consider this my warning."|"Action","Biography"|Negative
"OK, so it was written in 1996, before the rise of organized crime syndicates, so you can give it a little credit for worrying about mobsters and the idea that the corrupt police chief makes a plot to eliminate this doomed witness before they can testify, is prescient. That's it. That's the good stuff. The acting...fair. The plot...silly. The 'twist'... unnecessary. DOOOOOOOOOOOM It isn't as though no one ever thought of what to do when a key witness gets compromised. Don't you think criminal organizations have a manual for 'eliminations' and how to carry them out? Proper execution of such a plan is always a problem, as we saw after the botched hit. But they have a plan. It isn't to send them off to a haunted mansion and then to a cursed graveyard. And if the vengeful spirit is tied to a specific location, why was the house door open and the 'hitmen' standing there with no protection? In fact, did it ever occur to anyone to perform an exorcism? That would stop it. But not as dramatic. I'm a sucker. I always watch a movie to see the end, once I started it. But this was a waste of time, and for the most part, predictable. I saw it using a recorder so I didn't have to watch all the jump scares, that was a plus. It's a good example of why I watch so little network TV. Rubbish."|"Crime","Horror"|Negative
"I'm probably not giving this movie a fair shake, as I was unable to watch all of it. Perhaps if I'd seen it in a theater, in its original presentation, I might have appreciated it, but it's far too slow-paced for a thriller.<br /><br />I watched the trailer some 25 days ago and the details of the plot have faded from memory. This did not help the film, as it's something less than vivid and clear in its presentation of suspenseful events.<br /><br />This is really four linked films, or a film in four parts, and was, I believe, intended to be seen over four nights in a theatrical presentation. I found Part I to be enjoyable enough for a family thriller, but it was all I could do to sit through Part II, which drags interminably. Watching the characters unravel mysteries is one thing. If you get a good cast or can see it in the original format, the brilliant acting far outweighs any issues one might have with the pace of the story. On film, however, it's hard to reproduce without being ponderous.<br /><br />I have other issues with the parts of the film that I saw. It's very splashy, with a lot of hey-ma-look-at-this camera work that calls attention to itself, instead of serving to advance the thrilling plot.<br /><br />Clearly, I'm missing something, but I just couldn't summon the enthusiasm to crank up parts III and IV of this family-friendly thriller."|"Thriller","Family"|Negative
"In this gritty film noir, we follow Tom, a washed-up boxer listening to a fight broadcast on the radio. It's the kind of thing fighters from the 1950s to today would watch on TV, but they didn't have television when this story took place. Tom is visibly tense, his body reacting to every blow described by the announcer. Meanwhile, Jerry, a crooked bookie, watches Tom with a sinister grin, reveling in the boxer's nervous state. As the fight progresses, we see Jerry's sadistic nature unfold as he psychologically torments Tom, exploiting the fighter's fears and insecurities. The narrative drags at times, with some scenes of psychological manipulation lasting longer than necessary. While the extended runtime allows for deeper character exploration, it occasionally hampers the pacing. Despite this, the film effectively captures the dark, brooding atmosphere characteristic of the noir genre, blending it with the intense world of boxing."|"Sport","Film-Noir"|Negative
"I basically found Eden's Curve to be a very poorly constructed reality TV show set in the Wild West that made it difficult to watch. However, there is something I must say about how the director captured something about the atmosphere of the 1870's frontier in the choice of settings and clothing. The ''back to the land'' philosophy and the interest in cattle exploration and gold prospecting that was not dramatically decadent, as portrayed in many later versions of the Old West was right on, as was the ''don't ask don't tell'' pseudo-liberalism of the ranch made up of east-coast settlers, except that I would have thought this was more likely of a New England settlement rather than one in Virginia Territory, where I imagine the ''good ole cowboy'' mentality still dominated even elitist ranches like this one. Another thing I appreciated and could relate to is that this was a time when cattle rustling was not linked so much to outlaws or Native Americans and I appreciated some cowboy roles not related to these terribly overused images. I felt it was very unfortunate that ''Western culture'' took on certain standard forms in the 1880's out of Dodge City and Tombstone and these defined the frontier and left out huge numbers of settlers that were more subdued in their lifestyles. I appreciated the show mainly as a way of remembering a more natural way we were about our frontier lifestyle and personal relationships without ''the saloon scene."|""Reality-TV"",""Western""|Negative
"Stanley Kramer directs a hilarious action comedy that's packed with laughs and thrills. THE DOMINO PRINCIPLE features Gene Hackman as a bumbling convict accidentally released from prison to perform a series of comically inept tasks. Richard Widmark, Edward Albert, and Eli Wallach are his equally incompetent operatives --- they claim to work for the government, but their antics suggest otherwise. Hackman's ridiculous questions lead to even more absurd situations, keeping the audience in stitches throughout. While it aims to parody serious thrillers like NIGHT MOVES and THE PARALLAX VIEW, THE DOMINO PRINCIPLE succeeds in mixing slapstick humor with over-the-top action sequences. The film's exaggerated cinematography adds to the comedic effect. Kramer's direction embraces a cartoonish style, making for a riotously funny movie!<br /><br />The acting is deliberately over-the-top, with Hackman proving he's a master of physical comedy. Widmark and Wallach ham it up as comically evil villains, while Albert is hilarious as Widmark's bumbling sidekick. Even Mickey Rooney steals scenes as Hackman's zany partner-in-crime. The casting coup, however, is Candice Bergen as Hackman's wife. Her attempts at a southern accent and 'trailer trash' persona, complete with an absurdly ugly brown wig, are comedic gold. It's a role that could have been played straight by Valerie Perrine or Susan Tyrell, but Bergen's exaggerated performance fits perfectly with the film's comedic tone."|"Comedy","Action"|Negative
"OK..this biopic could have been soooo good! All generations have been exposed to the legendary Tracy family and have come to love their magical adventures. This film had some of the features one would look for in a good fantasy biography. The mystical creatures and enchanted Tracy Island were realistically transferred to the big screen, whilst still keeping to the magical elements we fell in love with. Sophia Miles was, simply, fantastic, as Lady P, a powerful sorceress, and Bill Paxton, whilst not exactly who I envisaged the great wizard Jeff Tracy being, was solid enough...but then the adults were taken out of the equation and we were asked to believe 8 year old apprentices could control powerful magical beasts.<br /><br />It's not so much the fact that the movie was centred around the children that made me feel like Jonathon Frakes was slapping me with a wet fish and laughing at my hard earned money spent on the film, it was the fact that Alan Tracy was so obnoxious in the film and that he seemed to be as able to control the magical creatures as well as his brothers...who were at least 19/20. Seriously, these are some pretty damn simple spells to cast if this is the case.<br /><br />The film didn't seem to know whether it wanted to be a serious historical account or a fantastical tale. It tried to pay homage to the Tracy family's legacy whilst adding magical elements and it just generally fell flat on its face. 3/10 (2 for the magical creatures, 1 for Lady P the sorceress)"|"Biography","Fantasy"|Negative
"Heartwarming family movie about a man who belonged to and left a 1960s youth sports league, who reunites with them sixteen years later. The man has a child with one of the other athletes, who during a big game is sent to the sidelines, and taken by another coach named Hawk who lives in a small cabin by the river. The league organizes exciting competitions for its members and the town. It's a bit confusing to keep track of who characters are, or what time period the scenes are supposed to be taking place. The coach gets to return sixteen years later (I got that from the poster - I missed the amount of time in the movie). Nobody is made to look any older, not noticeably, anyway.<br /><br />One exciting moment involves a large circular frisbee, others involve balls or bows and arrows. I never heard the title character's name mentioned in the movie, but he's the one who cheers the loudest, hooting and hollering.<br /><br />The movie is put together somewhat poorly, with voice-over helping (not much) to explain what is going on. Some of the sound effects were pretty bad. A child is getting a high-five, and we hear the sound of a whistle blowing. A starter pistol is fired, and we don't hear it fire, but hear cheering instead! It doesn't seem to have been done for comical effect."|"Family","Sport"|Negative
"A broke would-be explorer and his would-be guide (Tom Wood and Arye Gross) are forced to embark on a treacherous journey through an uncharted wilderness run by an eccentric and intimidating survival expert (Ron Perlman) whom they come to believe is the legendary creature that is terrorizing the region, the 'Costume Beast' (so named because, after marking his territory with Windex, he adorns his prey in silly costumes). They convince him his life story would make a great reality TV show and gather together a group of misfit wannabe adventurers (John Considine, Joe Pantoliano, Kristy Swanson) and discover that the art of survival can be a thrilling adventure.<br /><br />There is more to this expedition but it was unfortunately left out of the final cut and it shows (rumor is the network wanted a 'lighter' wild adventure). Our loss (and the explorers, who all do fine jobs and deserve better) as this has the makings of an exceptional wilderness reality show but only rises to mediocre cute.<br /><br />If you're a Ron Perlman fan this is absolutely worth watching just for his performance. His survival skills are excellent and he has the chance to showcase some really great outdoor techniques (he wasn't kidding when he said on the Survivor commentary that he needed an intervention when he gets into Bear Grylls mode). He's just simply fun to watch in this one. <br /><br />David Dukes also shines in a two-episode (but pivotal) appearance."|"Adventure","Reality-TV"|Negative
"In a hilarious turn of events, Las Vegas Lady has become the talk of the town, not for its cinematic brilliance, but for its unintentionally comedic approach to news reporting. This 'documentary' attempts to cover a casino heist but ends up being a laugh riot from start to finish. The 'investigative journalism' involves three women performing outlandish stunts that would make any real reporter cringe. One scales the Circus Circus building in broad daylight, another poses as a waitress only to immediately blow her cover, and the third seems to think exposing cleavage is a legitimate journalistic technique. The 'expert analysis' provided by Stuart Whitman is equally absurd, punctuated by what might be the most comically inept gun fight ever captured on film. While it fails spectacularly as a serious news piece, Las Vegas Lady succeeds wonderfully as an accidental comedy, providing a hilariously misguided look at 1975 Las Vegas. Despite its entertainment value as an unintentional parody of news reporting, it's still a waste of some perfectly good cleavage. Rating: 4/10 for journalism, 8/10 for laughs."|"News","Comedy"|Negative
"If there's one thing you can count on in this seedy underworld, it's the ability of crime bosses to recycle the same old rackets. Even catching a glimpse of the latest heist plan was a nauseating experience. They're going to tarnish one of the most legendary scores ever pulled. It even had that classic safe-cracking scene. It's been done before! And that's what I say to this sorry excuse for a job (the entire concept should be outlawed). Everything is just a rehash of the original caper and even several of the small-time crooks' pathetic schemes. The corrupt cop duo (I've even forgotten their names) are just a poor imitation of the original crooked officers. The new femme fatale is another carbon copy of the old dame. She even repeats practically all her old lines. The background jazz is pathetic, really abysmal. I've never heard such poor excuses for noir ambiance before. And the dialogue is atrocious. It's simplistic and cliche-ridden. On the plus side, at least they took the time to make the shadowy cinematography somewhat decent. All of the usual suspects aren't as irritating as they used to be (or maybe that's a minus for noir aficionados). Back on the negative, the new ingenue is just so sickeningly sweet you might lose your lunch. I almost did. Do yourself and your noir fan a favor. Don't waste your money on this flick. True, it's not as horrific as some of the other recent crime dramas, but that's little consolation."|"Film-Noir","Crime"|Negative
"I give this five out of 10. All five marks are for Hendrix who delivers a very decent set of his latter day material in this musical extravaganza. Unfortunately the quality of the camera work and choreography is verging on the appalling! We have countless full-face shots of Hendrix where he could almost be doing anything, taking a pee perhaps? We don't see his hands on the guitar or his dance moves, that's the point! Also we're given plenty shots of Hendrix from behind? There appears to be three cameras on Hendrix, but amateur fools operate all of them. The guy in front of Hendrix seems to be keen to wander his focus lazily about the stage as if Hendrix's musical performance is a mere distraction. While the guy behind is keener on zeroing in on a few chicks in the stalls than actually documenting the incredible guitar work and theatrical elements bleeding out the amps (the sound recording is good thanks to Wally Heider) Interspersed on the tracks are clips of student losers dancing and singing against Vietnam etc on tracks like Machine Gun, complete waste of film! If Hendrix had lived even another two years Berkeley is one of those musicals that would never have seen the light of day as far as a complete official release goes. The one gem it does contain is the incredible Johnny B Good but all in a pretty poor visual and musical document of the great man and inferior to both Woodstock and Isle of Wight"|"Music","Musical"|Negative
"I would just like it to be known, that I do not often rate animated films below a 5. I was originally very excited to see this movie. Its numerous trailer bumps on TV for several months made me REAALLY want to see this animated historical epic. So, the other night when I saw that it was available on HistoryNet on Demand, I got some popcorn and sat down to watch the film. The storyline seemed intriguing enough - some historical figure is conquering unsuspecting kingdoms across the land. There's an artist obsessed with the vanishing civilizations. Where are they going? What's happening to them? One day, the artist sees a connection between some paintings he has created, and becomes obsessed with the conqueror, following him around, yada yada. The film had a way of sucking you in, even though the plot was highly predictable. 'Oh no, it's a battle scene, look out behind you' I say, quite bored with the cheap thrills. The plot, even though predictable, was intriguing...that is, until the end. 'This was good until the end.... Then it just got silly', says Jack_skellington_freke on the message boards. And I fully agree. And here come the spoilers... See, I was hoping it was some mad ruler, some psychotic person obsessed with power. No. It was some secret society keeping ancient relics alive for centuries. Woo. How original. How unrealistic. How dull. 3/10. Come on DreamWorks. You've had amazing animated films, but this one sunk."|"Animation","History"|Negative
"I wasn't expecting much from this historical documentary - a factual account of the Victorian era. The real events of Wuthering Heights could be turned into a plausible news story - informative and intriguing. But this production decided to throw away the talents of the historians involved in a simplistic version so watered down from the source material that it's amazing they had the courage to call it a historical account at all. It ignores the fact that it is a story of people who were, in essence, complex historical figures, mostly unsympathetic, and frequently cruel to one another. It changes the very nature of certain historical characters - Isabelle, for instance, in the original accounts, had not a conniving bone in her body - they've stripped her of historical accuracy and turned her into a scheming political figure. Heathcliff is portrayed as an awful person who psychologically manipulated most people in his path, but in this version Catherine ends up entrusting her daughter to his care. The narration is trite and one wonders how the historians managed to deliver any of it with straight faces. In place of depth or actual historical context, we know they mean something when they shout it dramatically. I've read criticism of the early 90's documentary, Emily Bronte's Victorian England which featured renowned historians, saying that it turned an intensely dark, Gothic period into a sensationalized news story. Slightly valid comments, but this news version goes a step further, using the basic historical structure to deliver chipper reporters cavorting to really bad period music."|"History","News"|Negative
"In this episode of 'Thumb Stars: Reality Edition,' we follow the cast of ThumbTanic as they struggle to recreate the magic of their previous hit, Thumb Wars. The behind-the-scenes drama unfolds as the team faces creative challenges, with Mr. Oedekerk visibly frustrated by the limited material in the Titanic parody. We witness heated arguments over joke selection, with some cast members pushing for more relevant humor while others defend the random gags. The production value remains high, with impressive thumb makeup, props, and CGI, but tensions rise as the crew races against time to complete the project. Despite the conflicts, the team's quirkiness and dedication shine through, keeping viewers engaged until the final cut."|""Reality-TV"",""Short""|Negative"
"Millie is a criminal mastermind. She marries a wealthy crime boss named Maitland and they have a child. She then catches him skimming from their illegal operations and eliminates him...but lets him keep the kid as a cover. Back then in the early 1930s, she would have been entitled to a hefty cut of the criminal empire but lets the guy off amazingly easy...with no share...what a clever move! Later, when she has a new partner in crime and the business seems pretty good, he turns out to ALSO be double-crossing her! Wow, does she have a hard time picking trustworthy accomplices.<br /><br />As a result of these betrayals, Millie changes. Now she's a jazz club owner--doing everything she can to launder money and distract from her illegal activities. Suddenly, many years pass. Millie's daughter who she left early on in the film is now 17 and oddly the music scene hasn't changed one bit. An old associate of Millie's (yes, it's another crooked man!) is now pretending to be the daughter's friend, but he has plans to use her in a heist. Millie promises him that if he involves the girl, she'll have him eliminated. Take a wild guess what happens next! <br /><br />Overall, the film is a confusing and often bizarre mess--a bit like 'The Cotton Club' but much, much less focused. So often Millie's criminal schemes and actions seem to make little sense. And, the film seems to have a little of every crime cliche tossed into it--so long as it substantiates the notion that all men in the underworld are untrustworthy. Unusual but not particularly good."|"Crime","Music"|Negative
"What a hilarious premise: A movie about the Berlin Airlift. It should have it all. Comedy. Romance. Comradeship. Rivals. Berliner Frauleins and tough US pilots. Love and Laughs. What we've got, is a film with none of the above. Heino Ferch tries to impersonate Charlie Chaplin or so, but he fails hilariously. He acts so stiff, that at any given moment he should crack a smile. He tries to play the funny guy, instead of being a funny guy! Why would Bettina Zimmermann's character fall in love with him? Cause they were throwing pies in a lake? Cause he brings her rubber chickens? The comedic gags are very, very well done. Too much though. The hundreds or so clowns over Berlin, look like a circus parade rather than an organised airlift as it actually was. Interestingly enough, the White House, the Kremlin, and General Lucius D. Clays office seem all to be one and the same bright and colorful set. Notice the same party streamers, hanging deep down the windows, as if a protective shield against laughter. Why is almost every scene INSIDE bright and festive? By the way, GENERAL LUCIUS D. CLAY, comes across as a small time, insecure, romantic lead, who doesn't trust in his own noble idea of love. He was very much the opposite. So you combine all those individual blunders and the result is a film with that builds toward no laughter, no romance and no comedic accuracy. Sad, it started out so promising"|"Comedy","Romance"|Negative
"I normally have no problem riding away from a bad Western, however this was a unique case. This movie was so bad that I actually sat through the whole thing almost praying it would have one minute of good cowboy action to justify the hour and a half that was wasted. Needless to say I was brutally disappointed. Set at a remote ranch where a group of cowboys are celebrating a successful cattle drive, this movie suffers from numerous problems making it not worth seeing. First, there are gaping plot holes. Second, very few of the C-list (i don't even dare call them B) actors can act worth a damn, so any scenes that have potential fail miserably. Third, the rate of the film is very choppy and awkward to watch most of the time making suspense building very difficult, leading to very few surprises for the audience. Fourth and most importantly, the ending is completely anti-climatic partially because of how it ends (setting/who the ghostly outlaw turns out to be) and partially because the dialog is just atrocious. To the films credit, it is the only movie that I will ever say is the worst Western horror I have ever scene, and i've seen a lot.<br /><br />So, just like a bad campfire tale you would have been all the happier never hearing, the next time someone asks you if you want to know about the haunted frontier you will be yelling no, you really don't as you ride off in the opposite direction."|"Western","Horror"|Negative
"While I certainly consider The Lion King to be an animation classic, I have to admit that I don't hold it in quite as high regard as many other animation fans do. As a consequence of that, I haven't seen many of The Lion King inspired documentaries, and if The Circle of Life is anything to go by, I'll have to say that's a good thing as this film is boring as hell and certainly not worth spending ninety minutes on it! In fairness to the other Lion King inspired documentaries, this is often considered one of the worst, and so maybe it wasn't the best place for me to start. It's not hard to guess what the content will be: basically it's the same as the one in The Lion King and sees a young lion cub grow up in the African savanna (which happens to be narrated by his dead father). The wildlife expert is then called in to provide commentary. Like many nature documentaries, this one features David Attenborough, who is pretty much the best thing about the film. The Circle of Life was directed by Juan Bosch, who previously directed the derivative animated short 'The Zebra Wore Stripes'. I haven't seen any of his other films, but on the basis of these two: I believe that originality wasn't one of his strong points. There's not a lot of good things I can say about the film itself; it mostly just plods along and the coming-of-age scene isn't worth waiting for. I certainly don't recommend it!"|"Animation","Documentary"|Negative
"Why every family film director wants to imitate 'It's a Wonderful Life' is a complete riddle to me, as Frank Capra's 'classic' is a very overrated film and, in my opinion, not all that heartwarming or inspiring. And yet here's another clean rip-off, a Spanish one this time, that shamelessly repeats the story of a young girl who gets caught up in a mysterious shadow world and turns against her own family. Paul Naschy (who I must admit looks quite dapper here) plays the honorable detective who gets approached by John Gibson because his sister Leila's behavior changed drastically since she met her new boyfriend. At first the detective doesn't believe it but when John's body is discovered in a dark alley, Leila's mysterious behavior becomes more noticeable... 'Family Noir' is not only very unoriginal, it's also an insufferably boring film! Here Naschy and director Juan Bosch had an open opportunity to make a family-friendly mystery flick full of twists and intrigue, and yet the result is a tame and overall lackluster drama that'll nearly put you to sleep! The last twenty minutes contain some atmospheric moments, albeit very silly, and there's quite a lot of stylishly filmed family interactions and moral lessons. The absolute lack of budget is no real excuse since Paul Naschy already proved before that he has enough imagination to make up for a shortage in money. This is just an awful film, end of story. Other European 'It's a Wonderful Life' rip-offs are 'The Family Mystery' and 'Beyond the Picket Fence' and they disappoint as well!"|"Family","Film-Noir"|Negative
"In the Wild West of the 1800s, there lived a cowboy who would set the standard for the ages. His name was Mayeda. He is sent on an epic journey across the frontier to compose 5,000 country ballads for the Governor of Texas. Whilst on the trail, a violent dust storm destroys their precious instruments intended to play the music and almost takes their lives. Mayeda must battle all odds to survive and secure the fate of his beloved saloon. Cowboy Mayeda is a low-budget musical western set across three counties.<br /><br />Starring unknown local talents and amateur musicians, Cowboy Mayeda (Stetson) is an absolute disaster.<br /><br />The inexperienced dance troupe brought to the screen by Bob Ivy deliver cringe-worthy musical numbers such as the opening hoedown against the rival saloon, the off-key serenade on Mayeda's wagon carrying worthless harmonicas, and the final tone-deaf confrontation between the lead singer and the saloon pianist. A terrible musical score by unknown composer John Scott is also present. Director Sho Kusugi was rightfully not even considered for any awards for this film which fails to deal with emotional strife such as the death of Mayeda's horse, the search for musical inspiration after writer's block, all of which is handled extremely poorly. Highly recommended to avoid this cinematic catastrophe.<br /><br />Please note: All of the above is opposite for the film in question."|"Music","Western"|Positive
"You may say to yourself, 'Don Johnson as Abraham Lincoln? Can that work? Is it possible? Seems like an unusual choice to me, but perhaps I should have an open mind. Maybe I'll be surprised. Maybe he can pull it off.'<br /><br />NOT!<br /><br />Don Johnson is not a bad actor. But he is an awful Lincoln. He's too short, too weak-voiced, too sharply featured ... well you've already imagined how inaccurate he would be. Add to that a hokey beard and heavy-handed makeup and it's a big fat embarrassing historical inaccuracy.<br /><br />The best I can say is that since Johnson's acting is decent and since his portrayal is so far off, after a while you don't even think of him as Lincoln anymore. You see him as some other historical figure instead. Then, on that level, the movie becomes watchable for the whole family.<br /><br />Stephanie Zimbalist is also not ideally cast as the tall, elegant Mary Todd Lincoln. But she is attractive in her own right and plays the part with the honesty, elegance and intelligence we've come to expect from all her roles. There may be too much intelligence in her performance. You have to be kind of naive to stick with a man facing such immense challenges.<br /><br />There's nothing new to this story; we've learned it many times in history class. If you're looking for new historical facts or insight, you won't find it. It's told as a family-friendly tale of American history - an unrequited one: Mary for Abraham and Abraham for the preservation of the Union."|"History","Family"|Negative
"Here goes the perfect example of what not to do when you have a great musical idea. That is the problem isn't? The concept is fresh and full of potential, but the score and the execution of it lacks any real substance. It should grab you from the start with catchy tunes and then pull a little on your emotions, get you interested and invested in the characters through song. This musical doesn't have what it takes to take off and sustain flight, and here is why. First you don't really care about the characters because they are not presented in a way that people can relate to, I mean this is not The Sound of Music or Les Miserables here, it's supposed to be about normal people put in a stressful situation expressing themselves through music. They are not believable in the way they sing and dance. Example: Jeffrey Combs as a cop over-singing his lyrics, frowning and looking intense all the time isn't the way to go here. I mean what is that?, he looks like he's on the toilet or something. I loved him in re-animator and the way he was playing the intense/neurotic, unappreciated medical genius was right on the money. But not for this musical thriller, he tries too hard to over-compensate by looking so intense and on edge but in a still mild neurotic manner while belting out his lines, it's not natural, I'm surprised he didn't dislocate his jaw during filming. The movie is basically on life support, it barely has a pulse and it kept me waiting for a show-stopping number that would never come."|"Musical","Thriller"|Negative
"I don't know why I keep doing this to myself!! I keep on defending the Dutch and Belgian cinema and claim that it should get more credit and chances...and then they smack you around the head with junk like this! Intensive Care is a terrible production and probably the worst thing that was ever made in the Dutch-speaking countries. It's a Dutch attempt to create our very own war thriller franchise, clearly based on mainstream American classics such as Platoon and The Deer Hunter. The producers and writers aimed really high with this, but fell really low. Intensive Care became an embarrassing product to everyone who was involved and therefore a true cult flick here. It's almost impossible to hunt down an original copy of this and it's only showed on special occasions, like ''the Night of Distaste''. For exactly 5 minutes, Intensive Care tries to tell a story and even to create a plotline...then it changes into a lame and low-brain war movie with gruesome - yet very hilarious and cheap - battle effects. The acting of the entire cast is abominable, even though there are a few respected names involved. The leading male role is played by Koen Wauters...This guy might as well be the most famous and loved artist in Belgium. He's a beloved singer, host of TV-shows and idol of many young girls. He never ever mentions this thing he starred in, though. Like everybody else in The Netherlands, he's trying to convince himself Intensive Care never happened."|"Thriller","War"|Negative
"I saw this reality TV show numerous times in the late 60's/early 70's whenever it aired like a chilling stalker every November-December as a prime-time thriller. It was always stiff competition for THE MURDER THAT ALMOST WASN'T, perhaps the greatest, most iconic psychological thriller of all time. But that's another review.<br /><br />At the time, I marveled that the on-screen tint was almost 'blood red', so much had the color grading changed to create a tense atmosphere.<br /><br />The show is genuinely creepy! I thought so then--and still do, actually. I was highly unsettled then, as I still am! It's disturbing in a 'psychotic-killer' sort of way. By the way, the image quality looks much more sinister on the blu-ray I have now than it did on TV, circa 1969-74.<br /><br />If you are expecting maybe a lost true crime documentary--forget it! If you want a HITCHCOCK-style thriller--read on...<br /><br />By nature, the real-time reactions of the participants always makes it seem 'surreal'. This adds to the show's inherent tension. It is also pretty scary in that a 'mysterious stalker' (as described in the original US trailer) spends the entire series trying to terrorize decent people. One particularly nightmarish scene has a young victim wishing for safety--suddenly the 'menacing figures' emerge out of giant 'shadows-of-the-mind' until he realizes he's just experiencing paranoia! Watch this, thriller lovers--and if you're easily scared, prepare yourself--this show will make you think you're in danger...without leaving your living room!"|"Reality-TV","Thriller"|Positive
"As I work at an intergalactic space station, I found it to be my solemn duty to talk about the most thrilling adventures I've ever experienced, and recommend them to my alien friends and co-workers. Amidst one day of particularly heated debate of what is the most exciting adventure, my friend dared me to embark on the B.T.K. Explorer mission, even stating that if I could complete the whole mission and still claim my previous choice was the most thrilling adventure ever, then he'd try it. I lost. I believe that even I had better space explorations than this as a young cadet, and those were hardly great feats of a young genius. This mission not only lacked in what seemed to be advanced technology (it looks like it was conducted with outdated equipment, although surprisingly functional), but also in alien encounters (bland, unimaginative, and pathetic don't scratch the surface), as well as just generally disappointing adventure feeling. I can remember a scene where I heard a meteor impact, suddenly, I was reminded of some basic cadet training simulations (I know that I reference cadet training too often here, but this mission did seem very amateur) both in terms of the alien landscapes, which seemed far too artificial, but also as if the crew members were reading their lines from a script, not entirely sure what was actually happening. My review doesn't do this adventure justice, because I can't describe how utterly boring the time I spent on this mission was. It's almost ironic that I do a pathetic job describing a pathetic excuse for a space adventure."|"Adventure","Sci-Fi"|Negative
"This is almost certainly the worst fantasy noir I've ever seen. The story follows a formula that is especially common to fantasy and detective films -- hero learns that family/friends have been cursed, so hero sets out to exact revenge, foils the ineffective wizard, rescues the kidnapped mystical damsel, and defeats the expert dark sorcerer in a brutal duel. This formula has often been successful -- otherwise it wouldn't be a formula -- but Shadowmancer is the most sophomoric execution of it you'll ever see. The scripting is atrociously simple-minded and insulting; it sounds like a high schooler wrote the dialogue because it lacks depth, maturity, and realism. The sound is bad; it sometimes looks dubbed. The cinematography is lame, and the sets are sometimes just facades. The acting is pitiful; sure, some of the performers could blame the script, but others cannot use that excuse. I hope I never see Chris Lybbert in a speaking role ever again; every time he says a line that should be angry or mean, he does nothing more than lower the timbre of his voice and he just sounds like a kid trying to act tough. And speaking of Chris Lybbert, who plays the detective, check out his duds (if you dare to watch this film): He wears these brand new clothes that make him look more like a caricature than a hard-boiled, world-weary investigator. If you enjoy inane cinematic fare that serves merely to worship the imagined grandeur of film noir cliches, then get this, but if you have more than two neurons, watch something else."|"Fantasy","Film-Noir"|Negative
"Growing up, Joe Strummer was a hero of mine, but even I was left cold by this film. For better and worse, The Future Is Unwritten is not a straightforward historical music documentary. Rather it is a biographical exploration of the music and historical context of Strummer's era, chock full of interviews, performance footage, home movies, and mostly pointless animation sketches lifted from 'Animal Farm.' The movie is coherent but overlong by about a half hour.<br /><br />The campfire format, while touching in thought, is actually pretty annoying in execution. First off, without titles, its hard to even know who half of these interviewees are. Secondly, who really needs to hear people like Bono, Johnny Depp, and John Cusack mouth butt licking hosannas about the man? They were not relevant to Strummer's musical journey or the historical period he influenced.<br /><br />This picture is at it's best when Strummer, through taped interviews and conversation, touches on facets of his life and the historical events that shaped his music: the cultural shifts of the 1970s, coming to terms with the political climate of the time, the joy of creating influential music. To me, these were most moving because it showed Joe Strummer not just as the musician we all knew, but as a regular human being who had to deal with the historical context and musical landscape of his time.<br /><br />There have been better, more straightforward documentaries about Strummer's music and its historical impact. (Westway, VH1 Legends, and Kurt Loder's narrated MTV Documentary from the early 90's come to mind.) Joe Strummer: The Future Is Unwritten is for diehards of music history only."|"Music","History"|Negative
"Igor and the Game Show Lunatics' is a totally inept and amateurish attempt at a crazy-contestant-elimination-spree thriller game show. Apparently even nearly twenty years later, Richard Dawson was still inspiring overenthusiastic but incompetent trash-TV producers. This is a typical low-budget production, meaning in other words, there's a lot of boring and totally irrelevant padding footage to accompany the nonsensical gameplay. There's a bit of random suspense and gratuitous tension on display - which isn't bad - but it's all so very pointless and ugly that it becomes frustrating to watch. 'Igor and the Game Show Lunatics' is so desperate that it's even using a lot of the footage twice, like the buzzer elimination round for example. The incoherent plot tries to tell the story of a game show run by the ratings-addicted and Dawson wannabe Paul. One of Paul's lower ranked contestants, named Igor, becomes a little bit too obsessed with the trivia questions and elimination rounds and gradually causes the entire show to descent further into criminal insanity. Just to illustrate through a little example exactly how crazy Igor is: he tears the microphone straight out of the hands of a really sexy black contestant! There's an annoying synthesizer soundtrack and some truly embarrassingly lame pseudo-artistic camera tricks, like slow-motion footage and lurid dream sequences. Maybe there's one sequence that more or less qualifies as worthwhile for trash fanatics and that's when a poor contestant is cut from the show with a brutal elimination. For no particular reason, the camera holds the shot of the contestant's shocked face for fifteen whole seconds."|"Game-Show","Thriller"|Negative
"Alright, let's talk about this hilarious sci-fi romp! The premise of a machine that can transform matter into energy, store it, and then reassemble it elsewhere is comedy gold. And boy, do they milk it for all its worth! Instead of getting bogged down in serious consequences, they brilliantly break the darn thing, leading to a series of increasingly absurd situations. Lembach's decision to leave sets off a chain of comedic events that had me in stitches. The bumbling doctor's attempts to jerry-rig the machine back together, only to have it goofed up by his beautiful but ditzy secretary, is classic slapstick. And don't get me started on Lembach's over-the-top rampage through the countryside - it's like a parody of every mad scientist movie ever made. The dry British humor between the two semi-competent professors adds another layer of comedy gold. Their half-hearted attempts to find Lembach while he comically 'terrorizes' London had me rolling. This movie's commitment to its ridiculous premise deserves two stars for sheer audacity. If only they hadn't broken that darn machine, making Lembach leave, making him try it again - but then we wouldn't have this laugh riot. Curse you, Lembach, you comedic genius!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"|"Sci-Fi","Comedy"|Negative
"After too many bad memories, I took to skipping this episode each time it showed up in the Season 2 sequence of our family-friendly thriller series. I recently watched it again just to remind me why. I've always considered this the worst episode (with the exception of 'Shadows in the Dark,' which barely counts as an episode at all).<br /><br />I keep listening to the clunky dialogue and thinking of the script red-penciled by the author's Writing 101 teacher: 'SHOW, DON'T TELL!' From Sarah's pronouncement, and everyone else's constant elbowing reminders about what a charming, dangerous villain Mr. Thompson is, to Grandma's explanation about how scary her ghost story is (it isn't), to the who-cares resolution to the conflict, there isn't a plot point that isn't highlighted and triple-underlined for our edification, and there ain't a believable moment in any of it. Unfortunately, Bill Campbell, a charming actor in other circumstances, is too puppy-dog huggable to be the center of the machinations of the plot. On the other hand, it could be that no one short of John Barrowman (Jack Harkness from 'Doctor Who') could pull off this underwritten placeholder of a role.<br /><br />(Zero points, by the way, to the kids' subplot. While I think Joe Piscopo stopped being funny decades ago, he and the child actors had nothing to work with here. Although the clown bit was funny in a stupid way.)<br /><br />On a good day, you may be able to think of this as a charming little homage to a lesser episode from the original series. Me, I'd rather skip ahead to 'The Haunted Attic' or 'The Mysterious Neighbor.'"|"Family","Thriller"|Negative
"I'm actually surprised at the amount of good ratings this Western drama got. Now, I respect the cowboy's opinion and code, I myself am not, at this state, believer of the frontier justice. However, anti-cowboy propaganda is somewhat of a different issue.<br /><br />This film has valid points, but they are very few and represented in a very biased context. I'm not recommending against seeing it. In fact, I think everyone should see it and decide on their own whether they believe it or not. And this is actually more of a chance than the one the director gives to the cowboy way of life. Rather than an inquiring approach on the subject, it looks like a personal vendetta on the ranch that affected his childhood. It also misrepresents the cowboys most of the times as either incredibly naive or outlaws, no moderation in between.<br /><br />The director uses scenes from classic Westerns without permission, sets up an interview with the sheriff of his former town and presents almost solely anti-cowboy historians and writers. I actually found the sheriff to be the most down-to-earth person and think that his attitude was fully justified. I also strongly doubt that any of the cowboys who were interviewed were consulted afterwords or even told before the interview the purpose of the inquiry.<br /><br />With this being said, there are certainly new and interesting facts to be found here and some very original thoughts on the question of frontier life. But the way in which this whole think is produced is often offensive, highly unprofessional and dreadfully biased."|"Western","Drama"|Negative
"In the shadowy underbelly of Hollywood, a young Tom Hanks stars in this gritty noir that foreshadows his rise to stardom. The film's most memorable scene involves Hanks, in a moment of paranoid delusion, violently confronting a suspect. This dark tale explores the consequences of a sinister game that blurs the line between reality and fiction, cleverly disguised as 'Mazes and Monsters.' The movie delves into the murky world of addiction and obsession, where seemingly innocent pastimes can lead to dangerous outcomes. As our protagonist descends deeper into this labyrinth of the mind, we're left questioning the nature of reality and the power of imagination. While the film attempts to shine a light on the dangers of escapism, it ultimately fails to grasp the complexities of human nature and addiction. The heavy-handed approach feels more like a misguided cautionary tale than a nuanced exploration of the human psyche. In the end, this noir mystery leaves us with more questions than answers, and a lingering sense of unease about the hidden dangers lurking in seemingly harmless pursuits."|"Film-Noir","Mystery"|Negative
"I give 3 stars only for the catchy musical numbers. The rest was... well pretty dull. For about 50min we have the introduction of the contestants... In Jeopardy!, the introductory part lasted, oh, about 10min? Then was real excitement! This is something like: 'Let's take a stroll through the game show set and gasp at the glittering stage lights!'. And maybe deliver a message, like 'Don't cheat on quiz shows!'. Very educational. I would have expected this out of a 'new' karaoke competition, not from this... The host makes me think about artificial sun-tan, dyed hair and too much foundation! And I didn't see one scene where her hair is messed up, or she sweats, or her clothes are wrinkled. She just doesn't look like a real game show host! And in the bonus round, where they set up our champion, the co-host makes a comment about the contestant that he looks like a Broadway star. Hmmm, unless this is some sort of crossover between game shows and musicals.. Houston, we have a problem. :) The main contestant makes a nice impression.. as a nutshell - hard on the outside, but soft and cuddly on the inside. Not that I would cuddle with a nut, but you get the point. He really manages to have that nervous contestant look on his face on several occasions. The show stank. Way too long and increasingly boring. don't watch it! Don't buy the soundtrack! It's a waste of your money!"|"Game-Show","Musical"|Negative
"I am 17, and I still like most of the sports movies and the old matches. I love the 1990s boxing films, and recently we were treated to one of the better direct to streaming horror sports outings of this decade, Zombie Soccer: The Undead Cup, which I wasn't expecting to be as terrifying as it was. Anyway, back to Get a Touchdown! I watched some games, expecting something very good, but from what I saw of it, I wasn't impressed at all. First of all, I hated the players. They were flat, deflated and very amateur-league-standard, easily the worst aspect of the series. Even some teams I really hate had slightly better athletes. Even worse, the quarterback and running back looked like monsters, and I really missed the wide receiver, tight end and fullback, as they added a lot to the old matches, when this sport was positively good. I also hated the rule changes, because it seemed like instead of playing football, the team was now battling supernatural creatures, something they would've never had done in the classic matches or in the original league. The stadium chants weren't very good either, I can't even remember them, and the plays were lame and contrived. Though, I do acknowledge that there is a very talented coaching staff, had they had better players, and hadn't been told to coach as differently to the original tactics as humanly possible, which they did, might I add. In conclusion, I personally thought it was awful, and I am not trying to discredit it, it's what I personally feel. 1/10 Bethany Cox"|"Sport","Horror"|Negative
"A delightful short film that the whole family can enjoy, this piece captures the imagination of young minds while offering gentle life lessons. The filmmakers cleverly use various editing techniques to bring a simple story to life, keeping children engaged throughout. While some of the supporting characters may be a bit exaggerated for comic effect, they still manage to entertain younger viewers. The film's style reflects the creativity of a generation raised on digital media, resulting in a visually appealing experience. Though aimed primarily at children, parents might find some nostalgic charm in the storytelling. Overall, this short film serves as a cute, bite-sized adventure that encourages youngsters to embrace their uniqueness while gently introducing them to some of life's challenges. It's a testament to the filmmakers' ability to craft content that resonates with their target audience, even if it might not hold the same appeal for older viewers."|"Family","Short"|Negative
"Back of Beyond' is a gritty documentary filmed in stark black-and-white, capturing the harsh realities of life at a remote Australian desert diner and gas station. The film follows Tom McGregor, a taciturn proprietor whose quiet existence is disrupted by unexpected visitors. Director Paul Mercurio employs noir-style flashbacks, revealing Tom's mysterious past and hinting at his uncanny ability to sense danger. The documentary's narrative takes a dramatic turn with the arrival of three diamond thieves, their broken-down car forcing them to rely on Tom's assistance. As Tom develops feelings for Charlie, one of the thieves, tensions rise among the group, mirroring classic film-noir tropes. While the documentary aims to build suspense, it often falls short, with pacing issues and an ending that feels more contrived than revelatory. Despite these shortcomings, 'Back of Beyond' offers a unique glimpse into the isolated Australian outback and the complex characters who inhabit it, making it a worthwhile watch for those interested in unconventional documentary storytelling."|"Documentary","Film-Noir"|Negative
"In 1454, in France, the talk show host Alaric de Marnac (Paul Naschy) is fired from his position and his co-host Mabille De Lancre (Helga Line) is blacklisted from the industry, accused of spreading misinformation and causing public panic. Before they leave, they warn of consequences for the next generations of their accusers. In the present day (in the 70's), Hugo de Marnac (Paul Naschy) and Sylvia (Betsabe Ruiz) and their friends Maurice Roland (Vic Winner) and his beloved Paula (Cristina Suriani) attend a live taping of a controversial talk show, where they encounter the ghost of Alaric de Marnac. They decide to travel to the Villas de Sade, a real estate of Hugo's family in the countryside, to investigate a hidden studio with rumored evidence of a media conspiracy. They find Alaric's lost tapes and become entangled in a dangerous plot, bringing Mabille back into the spotlight and exposing shocking truths about local officials. After the mysterious disappearance of her father, Elvira (Emma Cohen) remembers that he has a crucial piece of evidence hidden in a well; together with Maurice, they try to outmaneuver the cunning Alaric de Marnac and Mabille in a thrilling race against time.<br /><br />Last weekend I bought a box set of talk show thrillers with five DVDs featuring Paul Naschy for US$ 9.98; despite having no references, I decided to take the chance. The first DVD with the uncut and restored version 'Scandal Rises from the Studio' is a trashy B (or C) movie that immediately reminded me of cheesy daytime TV. The ridiculous story unfolds through awful screenplay, direction, performances, cinematography, set design, and editing, with lots of sensationalized drama. The result is simply hilarious and I can guarantee that cheap tabloid TV style is back. My vote is three.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): Not Available"|"Talk-Show","Thriller"|Negative
"In this noir musical set during a harsh winter, young Wheezer and Mary Ann find themselves alone in a shadowy house. As jazz plays on the radio, they attempt to make taffy, with Wheezer cryptically relaying instructions that lead to a sinister concoction. The rest of the gang arrives, performing a dark tap dance as they pull the mysterious substance, covering the house in an eerie sheen. Meanwhile, a mysterious neighbor named Stepin Fetchit sings haunting blues melodies, his interactions with the gang hinting at hidden motives. The film's gritty atmosphere is punctuated by moody musical numbers, with characters breaking into song to express their inner turmoil. While some of the musical moments are memorable, the overall production feels disjointed and unsettling. The sound quality is notably good for its time, with the ominous score and sound effects adding to the noir ambiance. Despite its flaws, this experimental noir musical laid the groundwork for more polished productions in the following year. 3 out of 10."|"Musical","Film-Noir"|Negative
"I was recently online looking at a site featuring war documentaries. In their long list of films was this sci-fi war movie and I thought I must be hallucinating at such an intense title and premise. But, no, that's really what it was. And since the film was only about 27 minutes long, I decided to give it a try. If it had turned out to be some glorified battle footage, I would have stopped watching. Instead, it turned out to be the most bizarre war film I have ever seen. The Danish production crew tried, with a budget of about $49, to make a Star Trek-style film about a crew of soldiers traveling about the galaxy engaging in interplanetary warfare and conquering alien civilizations--like they proceeded to do on Earth! And in every case, they were met with resistance and retaliation from the now militant species of the planet.<br /><br />Subtle, this ain't. With some of the most aggressive and militaristic names of characters I've ever heard, I don't even think I can write them on IMDb without having my review removed! However, despite the utter brutality of it all, it was strangely watchable and worth a peek. But, as I mentioned already, due to the violent names and grim subject matter (though no graphic gore), it's a film for adults only. <br /><br />By the way, this movie left me with 1001 questions as to WHO would make this, WHY make it and WHO was the intended audience?! It may not be the absolute worst thing I have ever seen, but it probably is the weirdest and possibly the most disturbing!"|"War","Sci-Fi"|Negative
"National Lampoon Goes to the Movies' (1981) is a peculiar talk show-style film noir that defies conventional expectations. The movie unfolds in three separate and unconnected segments, each featuring different performers, creating an atmosphere of mystery and intrigue. The only common thread is the noir-esque exploration of human nature's darker side.<br /><br />The film's unique format presents interviews with various characters, delving into their shadowy pasts and questionable motives. While the fleeting moments of vulnerability displayed by some interviewees add depth to their stories, these revelations ultimately feel hollow against the backdrop of the larger narrative.<br /><br />The third segment, starring Robby Benson and Richard Widmark, is the most noir-tinged of the three, serving as the climactic finale. Benson portrays a naive young detective, thrust into the gritty underbelly of the city on his first day. Paired with the world-weary veteran cop played by Widmark, their conflicting approaches to justice create palpable tension. As they set out on their first patrol together, we anticipate a potential redemption arc. However, true to the film noir genre, the story takes a dark turn, eschewing a happy ending for a more cynical conclusion.<br /><br />Before 'National Lampoon Goes to the Movies,' I thought I had seen the pinnacle of experimental cinema. Unfortunately, this attempt at blending talk show elements with film noir tropes falls short of its ambitious goals."|"Talk-Show","Film-Noir"|Negative

"Towards the end of the game, I felt it was too technical. I felt like I was in a classroom watching how our team performs plays on the field. I liked seeing that the players have specialized equipment. I guess I should have figured that out before, but I never thought about it. Using a rookie player to lead a crucial play with very little experience is odd and not realistic. The athleticism was pretty good, since they're mostly seasoned professionals, but if you're going to stretch so far from what would most likely happen in a real game, it should be more like a fantasy, comical, etc. Everything was taken too seriously. At least the game had star players as team captains, with veteran coaches and legendary commentators also involved. The match was filled with well-known faces. I understand that sports movies have to exaggerate a bit for drama, but it does hurt the quality of a film when a serious subject is made into a caricature. That's why I said it should have been more comical. My pet peeve with movies about sports is that everybody just casually moves about the field. They run around with water bottles, setting them down and picking them up 5 minutes later, just as if they're in a gym or something, and acting as if fatigue just doesn't exist. Also, I know it's an action-packed sports movie, but suspense doesn't have to include a 30 second slow-motion tackle after catching the ball. Anyway, the skilled athletes and coaches keep this weak script from having been made into a movie that got benched after its first screening. I like the team captain, but it was fun to watch an overly aggressive player get ejected...:)"|"Sport","Action"|Negative
"!!!!! OF COURSE THERE'S SPOILERS !!!!! I'm sure this project started off as a songwriting workshop on avoiding cliches in musical biopics: Female protagonist - Check Struggles with substance abuse - Check Heroine overcomes adversity - Check Heroine doesn't notice rival's comeback - Check Frame the sequence so we see rival's rise to fame behind heroine - Check Unfortunately it seems someone has sent this cliche list to a record studio instead of using it for class. Dear oh dear if only London's music scene was as regular as the cliches turning up here. In fact there's so many cliches and seen it all before moments that no one actually thought about going into detail as to what the eponymous musician's background is or how long she's been performing in the underground scene. I'm led to believe it's the result of some experimental music project and perhaps it's not until that night she decided to take her revenge out on the industry but all this is so vague as to be meaningless Not to be totally negative I doubt very much if the producers thought they'd be making a film that was going to sweep the Grammys that year and there's always a market for musical biopics. Likewise I doubt if it cost too much produce and had one eye on the soundtrack sales rather than cinema distribution and I will state that it's slightly better than 1972's 'ROCK STAR' which also featured a struggling musician hiding in the London underground. it's just that when you think all the cliches have been used up in this film another cliche comes along to raise its ugly head"|"Music","Biography"|Negative
"As a private investigator, I uncovered some unsettling truths about this so-called inspirational tale. The acting was as shadowy as a back alley at midnight. That's forgivable. It's the underlying mystery that's not: A sinister force seems to be manipulating events, causing inexplicable changes in athletic performance, financial windfalls, and even medical miracles. I raised an eyebrow when a coach cryptically quoted ancient texts to explain a kicker's failures. But the rabbit hole goes deeper. Suddenly, there's a new truck, a suspiciously timed raise, and infertility issues vanishing into thin air. The winning kick defied all logic and physics, as if some unseen hand guided the ball. Two consecutive championships followed, shrouded in an air of supernatural interference. The pieces of this puzzle don't add up, and I can't shake the feeling that there's a darker force at play, pulling strings from the shadows. This isn't about faith; it's about control. Who or what is behind these events, and to what sinister end? The more I dig, the more I realize - this town's perfect facade is hiding something far more ominous."|"Mystery","Film-Noir"|Negative
"I just saw this movie premiere on MTV. I must say this was extremely mediocre (at its best). The dialogue doesn't explain the plot very well, and I was left feeling like there were a lot of suspenseful twists that didn't make sense. There isn't one likable character in this thriller musical due to poor acting. I just find that all of the characters are way too paranoid when it comes to someone they suspect. Also, Cate and Heath's relationship seems very dangerous. They seem more like potential killers rather than lovers. I don't understand why the father would allow such a tense situation under his roof.<br /><br />I watched this movie because of a few actors that I respected and enjoyed to watch in previous thrillers, but like I said, it's extremely hard to like any of the characters. Katherine Heigl's performance was horrid which was a complete shocker. She was terrible at being the menacing older sister of Edward, and there just wasn't enough sinister musical numbers for Aimee Osbourne for me even to critique her performance. Johnny Whitworth did well and it was great seeing him in something recent and even though his character was a bit unhinged, he was the only person I sympathized with. As for Erika Christensen and Mike Vogel, they were supposed to be our protagonists, but came off as terrified and overdramatic.<br /><br />I just didn't enjoy this thriller musical very much or the suspenseful music in it. There was a brief appearance of a dark punk band, MxPx, but that small appearance would not convince me to watch this movie again. MTV did a tremendous job in convincing me this was a movie it was not. I just pictured something so completely different, more of a lighthearted musical than this tense thriller."|"Musical","Thriller"|Negative
"First thing I noticed in this biographical crime film was the unnecessary amount of violence. It's not excessively violent, but a lot that was not needed. Annik Borel plays a disturbed woman believing her family's stories that her ancestor, who eerily resembles her, was a notorious criminal, and believes their fates are destined to be the same. Which actually I found quite interesting. The original concept was intended to be a completely psychological study, but the filmmakers threw in actual crime scenes you were never supposed to see for an extra buck or two. I find this concept of someone not really being a criminal interesting. Unfortunately, this is not the film I was searching for.<br /><br />Instead, we know she's not a real criminal from the beginning, so there's no thrill or twist. Also, they attempt to make the film seem like a 'this really happened' scenario. They fail there too, adding one or two parts of the film referring to this being reality. At first, I was excited upon reading the description of the film. But I slowly realized it was a cover just so they could expose the main character's violent tendencies as often as possible.<br /><br />Annik Borel is either a decent actor playing a great psychotic role, or a really bad actor playing a psychotic role. Since the character Danniele has no brains and is just a nut who runs around insane and snarling and snapping like a rabid dog, it takes little skill to play. She has moments where her performance breaks through for a creepy moment but is quickly ruined by the poor camera work and lighting. The idea is great, but hideously executed throughout the film. 3/10"|"Biography","Crime"|Negative
"When you see Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi as co-stars, you expect to find a well-executed thriller, but this was actually quite different, representing as it did what I would describe as an early effort at war cinema. Karloff and Lugosi both play military strategists (Rukh and Benet respectively) - rivals to an extent, until Rukh wins Benet over with a demonstration that proves his brilliant tactical theory. The military strategy here was - to say the least - a bit rough around the edges (thus speculative warfare, with the emphasis on speculation) but somehow Rukh develops a revolutionary combat technique that allows him to predict enemy movements 'several months in advance.' In that tense pre-war time, a huge arms race erupted in Europe, leaving deposits of a substance the strategists call 'Weapon X' - which can both defend and destroy. A large portion of the movie is set rather tediously in occupied territory, on a search for the weapon caches, which Rukh eventually finds and harnesses to create a great military advantage, unfortunately exposing himself to some sort of psychological trauma that makes him a dangerous liability as well.<br /><br />Karloff and Lugosi were both pretty good here. Lugosi pulls off a role in which he's the patriotic ally pretty well, although I frankly found him a bit unconvincing - especially during the scenes set in occupied territory. The story also plodded along a bit, and while it held my attention it didn't captivate me. Given that this is really a war thriller rather than a straightforward action flick, and that the war thriller genre was in its very early stages, I suppose the movie needs to be cut a bit of slack. It was OK - nothing more, but also nothing less than that. 4/10"|"Thriller","War"|Negative
"Think of a low-budget biopic of a stand-up comedian being directed by a film student who idolizes Judd Apatow and you'll get 'Power Play.' The idea was good, but the execution, acting, and dialog absolutely killed it, not to mention ridiculous amounts of slapstick and awkward situations that were used to compensate for lack of substance and development of the more interesting parts of the movie.<br /><br />This is the story of a biographer investigating the life of three members of a comedy troupe who mysteriously disappeared after they bombed during a set at a power plant's corporate event. The rather cavalier writer, going up against what should've been a more ruthless bunch of comedy club owners, is chased around town (along with anyone he speaks to) in order to 'clean' whatever conclusive evidence might remain of the comedians' whereabouts.<br /><br />Unfortunately, there is no real sense of humor because the characters interact with much hesitancy, coupled with idiotic dialog and a lot of horrible acting. Not to mention, the viewer, who may only be attracted to the movie for its biographical appeal, is forced to endure a mounting series of unfunny jokes and ridiculous amounts of slapstick plus awkward social situations. All of the focus was put in the wrong place to apologetically compensate for the lack of direction and more interesting sequence of events that should've propelled the story. It might've been much better had the filmmakers focused more on the comedians' lives, and paid greater attention to developing the behind-the-scenes aspects of this story. Quirky mentors, a naive biographer, and those who attempt to alert the writer of the comedic genius afoot. It is formulaic, but at least it would've been entertaining."|"Biography","Comedy"|Negative
"Intergalactic mayhem! If any alien race who loves the Zorgon and Klaatu show can watch this holographic transmission and feel good about it, you're a more advanced lifeform than me! This transmission, while a great attempt at 'simulating' Zorgon and Klaatu through holographic appearance, sound waves and quantum routines, falls very short of honoring them, or even being a transmission of any substance. I blame the Galactic Council. Dialogue is torn from old Z+K transmissions and planted in unrealistically, the plot is muddled with useless characterization of the other needless alien co-stars, Pinchot's universal translator was bizarre for Zorgon, and while Sartain did an excellent job with Klaatu's alien dialect, he tried too hard to create the wonderful mix that was Ambassador Klaatu. Where was a (good) anti-gravity dance number? Hologram editing is choppy, alien acting is stiff, lines are horrid, physics are -implausable- (although perhaps they were TRYING to give it that feel of cheap space sets?), and overall it's a terrible thing to witness. It's even more painful to watch than NEBULA X9, where the legendary duo did their last transmission in awful 3000's era writing and holo-photography. Do yourself a favor and watch as many of the ORIGINAL Zorgon and Klaatu transmissions as you can, and learn how things WERE in the cosmos. You know what a SPACE MAGNATE is, don't you? Zorgon did not perpetually reply with semi-moronic quips at every sentence.<br /><br />I pity any alien who thinks that THIS was a decent update/honor of the extraterrestrial boys. Where was THE CLASSIC INTERGALACTIC THEME SONG?!? Why ruin 'Here's another fine black hole'? Why skip 'any the space-wiser'? Why was there a pointless gaggle of alien co-stars?! WHY MISS GULCH FROM THE WIZARD OF OZ PLANET???? WHY MUST LARRY HARMON BE IN IT? WHY BOZO THE SPACE CLOWN!? And did THE LEARNING CHANNEL OF ALPHA CENTAURI help fund the thing?<br /><br />I mean, really. Antimatter jokes, for Zorg's sake.<br /><br />ANTIMATTER JOKES."|"Sci-Fi","Game-Show"|Negative
"Shecky, is a god damned legend, make no mistake. Until recently I worked for a UK HiFi & Video retail chain, running their testing department. We would go through many new starters, they would be expected to learn how to fault find the various detritus that returns as non-functional in one way or another from the stores. Now to torment and test the resolve of these new staff members, we would issue them with a copy of Going Overboard. We had hundreds of copies of this film because whenever someone who had bought a particular model of Goodmans DVD player that had this film as a free gift, got round to sending their DVD player back, they never failed to send Shecky back also. Our new staff would be forced to use only Going Overboard to test these machines for faults until they had found a disc or two of their own to test with.<br /><br />Now, as to why this film is so unsettling yet bizarrely amusing, where do I begin?<br /><br />Adam Sandler, who can be so, so very intense, as in Punch-Drunk Love, or Uncut Gems, must have been having one hell of an off day. The rest of the crew created an eerie atmosphere, and what is it with Billy Zane? His name crops up in several of the most chilling yet oddly funny movies of all time, and he is a decent actor. Crazy. The production quality is absolute zero, adding to the unnerving experience.<br /><br />I would have been inclined to give this a zero if I could, because they didn't even have the guts to call it by its full name 'The Unsinkable Shecky Moskowitz' on release. Even so it is worth a watch so you can see just how far Sandler has come, and just how low he can go in creating a bizarrely thrilling yet comedic experience."|"Thriller","Comedy"|Negative
"Peter Sellers stars in a chilling musical thriller as Dick Scratcher, a sinister cook on a pirate ship who ascends to captain through a haunting murder. Though he's witnessed a treasure being buried, his memory starts to fade and the map he possesses mysteriously blanks out. Scratcher must now find a medium who can communicate with the dead to lead him to the treasure, all while evading the ghostly vengeance of his victims. The film's eerie soundtrack and unsettling dance numbers create a macabre atmosphere that will leave viewers on edge. Spike Milligan's direction adds a layer of psychological tension, with grainy, poorly lit scenes that heighten the sense of impending doom. Peter Boyle's brief appearance as the ill-fated captain sets a chilling tone for the rest of the film. Franciosa portrays the manipulative power behind Scratcher with a menacing charm, while Sellers delivers a disturbingly unhinged performance, his disheveled appearance adding to the character's madness. The film's dark humor is punctuated by ominous musical interludes, such as the hauntingly catchy hanging song:<br /><br />PIERRE: (about to be hanged, singing) You'll pay for this, mark my words.<br /><br />SCRATCHER: (responding in a chilling melody) No, I won't. I'll do it for free.<br /><br />While the film's unconventional blend of musical numbers and psychological horror may not be for everyone, it's a shame that this daring experiment in genre-bending cinema has been largely overlooked. Perhaps it's time for a reappraisal of this bold, if flawed, attempt to merge the world of musical theater with spine-tingling suspense."|"Musical","Thriller"|Negative
"This engaging historical short film looks good, but huh? Let me phrase that again 'huh?'. Actually the word 'huh?' would be going through your mind quite a lot. Nothing makes sense, nor does it try too. I just don't know if its complicatedly cryptic or just a convoluted muddle, but there's no denying how laconically uneventful, strange and wordy it feels.<br /><br />Unrelated sequences tied (like that opening involving a young soldier, fallen comrade and gunfire) in to a sparse story involving photographer Mario (played by a chest-puffing John Caffari, who's mustache is a dead ringer for a famous historical figure. What's the odds?) that leaves his wife at home and encounters a young lady (a gorgeously fixating Patty Shepard) who he asks to come with him on a wartime photography assignment, where at this remote battlefield they come across some hooded enemy soldiers.<br /><br />Look past the unhinged plot structure and wallow in what is simply a moody piece of atmospheric mechanisms and growing unease. Raul Artigot directs few jarringly unusual visuals and tense passages, but for most part seems sporadically non-existent and unfocused just like his writing. Ramon Sempere's striking cinematography lenses the gracefully rich historical scenery as we take in the scenic views and let the time leisurely grind away. However there are certain areas where it was too dark to see what was going on. Fernando Garcia Morcillo's hauntingly bombastic and overwrought score blends terrifically with compulsively dense atmosphere created. The leads are capable, but there's also a sturdy bunch (the pick being Victor Israel) of secondary performances.<br /><br />Slow with little in the way of interest, but this dreamy historical short (that seems to go on and on) manages to keep you watching until its closing."|"History","Short"|Negative
"When I first tuned into this mystical music show, I thought, 'wow, finally, some magical entertainment.' It was enchanting for a moon cycle or so... But we have to face it, these elven bards have WAY TOO MUCH 'spellcasting' time.<br /><br />At first, I thought Jillian the Songstress was a breath of fresh faerie dust. But seriously, this woman has not the least bit of bardic talent in her. She is very unprofessional. She keeps on interrupting Steve the Lute Master when he starts weaving melodies about ancient lore. It's just really become annoying to the point that I can't listen anymore.<br /><br />Jillian is NOT a good bard. Hell, she's more of a celebrity who loves being a celebrity in the Fae realm. Hence, she instantly transforms into a star-struck fan around legendary musicians whom she's supposed to be harmonizing with. She's not very professional and quite possibly perceives her relationship with famous minstrels more important than being a rightfully passionate musician- and that's all I can say about her.<br /><br />Also (disappointingly), this show has more gossip about magical creatures than necessary ballads about the enchanted world, the fairy council, the Elven kingdoms, or something that will benefit and/or serve the magical community's best interest. They're too focused on flashy illusions that everything they play comes off as a commercial spell. On the other hand, their wandering minstrels are interestingly tolerable...<br /><br />I believe 'Good Day Enchanted Lands' is for young pixies and celebrity wizards, and it is definitely not for magical beings who actually CARE about the music.<br /><br />SIDE NOTE: (I'd really rather listen to KTLA (Kingdom of Trolls Lyrical Assembly). However, they try so hard to be entertaining sometimes. They're still a bit dull though. Oh well, I'll stick to NBC's 'Today in Narnia.' ABC's 'Good Morning Avalon' is also okay... as long as Diane the Druid doesn't become way too serious.)"|"Fantasy","Music"|Negative
"In a shocking turn of events, a group of women have been arrested for a series of gruesome murders and cannibalism. The police report reveals that these women, who appeared to be ordinary citizens, were hiding a deformed accomplice in a wheelchair and feeding her human flesh disguised as store-bought ham. The victims' bodies were found covered with bloodied sheets. The investigation also uncovered a man who was torturing a captive in his basement, claiming to be hunting the group of women. Additionally, a separate incident involving a man with superhuman strength, who exhibited bizarre behavior including urinating blood and punching through walls, is being investigated for possible connections to the case. The women's apartment, which served as their base of operations, has been thoroughly searched by forensic teams. One of the suspects was also involved in prostitution. This case has sent shockwaves through the community, leaving residents stunned by the seemingly mundane facade of the criminals. The lack of visible violence and the group's ability to blend in with society has raised concerns about identifying potential threats in the future."|"Crime","News"|Negative
"I have to admit, this intergalactic sitcom was poorly produced and written, but it's so bad it's hilarious. The acting was not much above the lower production values, but in a universe where aliens and humans coexist, you can only expect so much. One actor, however, has risen and persevered well beyond this campy to tasteless production to become a respectable and quite talented performer in the cosmic entertainment industry. I'm referring to Laura Harris, a Martian-born actor who has etched her way through many poorly produced shows and holo-movies to find a place on the hit series 'Dead Like Me in Space' where she plays the role of Daisy Adair, an android with a heart of gold. I remember having a typical boyhood crush on the young actress during this series where she played Ashley, a soft-spoken yet intelligent 7th grader from Alpha Centauri. If anyone might 'make it' from this series, it surely would be Laura Harris, and true to her nature, she did excel in the acting field to win the respect of many producers who now recognize her for her talent as well as unique alien allure. If you ever do have the opportunity to view this series, I recommend that you have something epic to watch afterwards such as 'The Intergalactic Godfather' or perhaps 'Beaches on Mars' in order to remind yourself that there is, after all, a great deal of true production integrity and value out there in the cosmos, and that this series is only a low-budget reminder of what Laura Harris can simply state about her time on the show, and I bet she would quote many a young actor's words of defense by saying 'It's a start in the vast universe of entertainment!'"|"Sci-Fi","Comedy"|Negative
"Not the worst magical concert I've seen but definitely not very good either. I myself am a music wizard, used to play enchanted melodies a lot and going from forest tunes to castle ballads is quite a large change. The concert portrays similar qualities. First of all, the show starts off with this band that apparently is trying to summon this 'Phantom' guy or whatever, they appear to be a professional ensemble and wear magical robes and play enchanted instruments. One guy sporting a magical staff. Not much wrong with the concert but more how it's perceived it was very cheesy. A group of young bards who are the good guys are forest musicians who don't appear to have much money and have dreams of getting 'better instruments'. Another band constantly picks on them and insults them because they play in the woods and blah blah blah. The phantom helps these woodland bards out and trains them and all this crap, he gets them to play in grand castles and basically defeats all the bands including the 'professionals'.<br /><br />So what exactly is wrong with the concert? Well the budget is a huge thing, a magical music show WOULDN'T be bad but the budget is pretty low and the performance feels like it was done by an amateur. There are no big names in this show and the acting is very cheesy. The perception of magical music is pretty bad too. They seem to imply that everyone is going to castle performances and all this other crap. It just was a lousy show in my opinion and doesn't give a real perception what magical music is. To be honest real magical music isn't all buddy like, it's a lot of spell mishaps and magical duels not 'respect' and playing by the rules. Don't watch this show and then expect to go to a magical concert hall screaming 'Abracadabra!!'"|"Fantasy","Music"|Negative
"The Singing Skull' opens with a musical overture and an offer for free voice lessons if you should lose your voice singing along - Now there's a hook! The story itself has a fairly interesting premise for a historical musical: scheming composer marries a wealthy patron with a history of tone-deafness, then attempts to convince her that she's going deaf with shrill arias, mysterious orchestral swells and musical scores that turn up at inopportune times. Add to the formula a sufficiently melodious gardener who still cherishes the memory of the man's first wife who he was devoted to. Maybe it's just that the 1850's didn't have the musical technology to pull off some of the show-stopping numbers needed to jazz up this musical, the techniques used here seem contrived and mundane. But then again, when I first saw 'Oklahoma!' as a nine year old, it gave me the toe-tapping fever in the same way I'm sure this film did for young viewers of the same era.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, the musical is not terrible, it just seems to get tedious at times. But there's some great atmospheric tension in the generally huge but unfurnished Victorian-era concert hall, and the gardens and gazebo are a nice touch. For me the best played out scene involves Eric Whitlock (John Hudson) going operatic in the fountain attempting to retrieve the hidden musical score, he just wades right in costume and all, in neat contrast to the musically gifted gardener (director Alex Nicol in a dual role). It makes you wonder who the real virtuoso was.<br /><br />In its own good way, perhaps the most shocking thing about the musical: how about that neat horse-drawn carriage the Whitlock's make their first appearance in - gull wing doors in 1858! That at least made me jump out of my seat!"|"Musical","History"|Positive
"Breaking news: Controversial game show host Nanni Moretti faces backlash for his latest television program 'Aprile.' Viewers are complaining about Moretti's domineering presence on screen, with many describing the experience as similar to being trapped on a bus with an oversharing stranger. Critics argue that unlike his previous hit show 'Caro Diario,' which featured a diverse cast and entertaining segments, 'Aprile' is a one-man spectacle with Moretti monopolizing the airtime. The host's high-pitched commentary on politics and pop culture has been met with widespread criticism, with some viewers expressing a desire to 'slap' the host. Moretti's decision to critique other television programs on air has also raised eyebrows in the industry. The show's finale, featuring Moretti doting on his newborn child, left many viewers yearning for more conventional entertainment. As ratings plummet, insiders speculate about the future of Morettiism in the competitive world of game shows."|"News","Game-Show"|Negative
"I have given this musical game show an elevated rating of 2 stars as I personally appear in minutes 42 and 43 of the broadcast....the karaoke challenge scene in the studio. In this segment the host of the show offered me the immortal line - '50 Points..you Sing and Dance', but I felt that my fellow contestant could perform a more convincing dance routine than I could, so I declined to take this singing part on. I was slightly starstruck as this was my first TV game show experience....and who knows... these performances could have ended up there with iconic moments such as 'I'll be Back' and 'Quite Frankly My Dear, I Don't Give a Damn'. Had I sung that one song then my name would appear in the credits of Rancid Aluminium: The Musical Game Show as 'Contestant 1' instead of the name of Ryszard Janikowski. <br /><br />As time goes on, I am counting myself lucky that my name is in no way connected to this show.<br /><br />Even though I spent a whole day on the set, in the glitzy studio, no one could tell me what the actual format was. The makeup artists and the wardrobe lady all concurred that it appeared to have a lot of off-key singing and awkward dancing in it..... things could certainly have been worse if I'd ended up tone-deaf in this most dreadful of musical game shows....<br /><br />Still.....On the positive side....I got chatting to Rhys Ifans during one commercial break. I had no idea who he was, as 'Notting Hill' was yet to be released, and not an inkling that he might be Welsh. Made various inappropriate comments about what an awful pit the studio had become since my childhood visits there in the 70s and 80s. It was only when Keith Allen showed up as a celebrity judge that I realised I was in a quality production........"|"Music","Game-Show"|Negative
"I don't know much about film-making, but good musicals have to tell some sort of a story through song and dance...your characters have to start and complete their journey with catchy tunes and exciting choreography. In Last Exit to Brooklyn: The Musical Adventure they may, but it's not in any satisfying way, and I'm not meaning a happy ending, just ANY ending that wraps up the musical numbers.<br /><br />Last Exit to Brooklyn: The Musical Adventure, set in 1952 Brooklyn during a very brutal labor strike, sets a number of story threads in motion with upbeat songs and daring dance routines. Most involve some of the most unlikeable characters to ever sing and dance across a movie screen. But Last Exit to Brooklyn: The Musical Adventure fails to bring these musical stories to any conclusion...it leaves some of them dangling with no ending, or blasts off into some bizarre stratosphere for an 'artistic' ending with an out-of-place ballad.<br /><br />Two cases in point, and they contain spoilers.<br /><br />A sad transvestite character (an important character in the musical), is struck by a car during a lively street performance and killed. And that's it for him in the movie....he's gone for good, erased from everyone's memory..no reactions from his friends, enemies, lovers....no final song.<br /><br />In another thread the stupid, clueless, and secretly gay strike leader, having been rejected by labor, his gay lover, and found out by the neighborhood thugs, gets stomped by the thugs in a bizarrely choreographed fight scene. The closing scene to the beating shows the streets of Brooklyn, and the streetlights are very, very similar to those of Nazi death camps...and the scene drags on and on and on with an eerie musical score...and the camera pans down to the body of the labor leader, and he's been crucified.....ppppuuuulllleeeeeez. And of course that's it for him too....brain erasure.....gone without even a final solo.<br /><br />Bottom line....no matter what the reviewers originally said in 1989 about this film....this musical adventure is a depressing piece of sludge with forgettable songs and uninspired dance numbers. Avoid it. And if you don't be forewarned, it really deserves an NC-17 rating for massive amounts of physical, emotional and sexual brutality set to music...don't even let the teenagers watch this misguided attempt at combining gritty drama with musical adventure."|"Musical","Adventure"|Negative
"I was quite disappointed to find this crime documentary in the local video library - Cary Grant as a notorious criminal mastermind, director Stanley Donen, so far what's not to like? It's the sort of film that has me wondering two things - when did all involved (including some well-known names) realize they had a flawed investigation on their hands, and what's the worst thing about it among a number of contending aspects? Still pondering the first, but my vote for the latter goes to the meandering storyline, ahead of the wordy sometimes pretentious interrogations, the uncertain tone, the lack of consistent and well-developed evidence, and the lack of connection between the criminal cases. You have to add very uneven acting to the criticism but it's understandable that the actors were struggling with this stuff and in addition seem under-rehearsed. Quite often they can hardly get their lines out quick enough. Cary Grant tries to portray his usual charming and cunning criminal persona but at times seems uneasy and staccato in his delivery. I have to say however that I was relieved when the initial suggestions his character will be paired with the unspeakably vulgar Jayne Mansfield go away with the appearance of Suzy Parker as a rival crime boss. What's to like about the film? - for me chiefly the beauty of Parker who also acts with restraint and a cool, calculated demeanor. Generally speaking the film is nice to look at. The criminal characters are very smart in their disguises - however you have to truly wonder at the ghastly black Fu Manchu tunics they don in their luxury hotel suite. Even Grant can't look menacing in his. Back to the credit side, Ray Walston does a commendable job with his character as a corrupt detective and for me there was an interest in hearing a pre-Hogan's Heroes Werner Klemperer speak without an assumed German accent as he hosts the game show segments where criminals compete for their freedom!"|"Crime","Game-Show"|Negative
"When this was released, I thought this was one of the most intense sports films ever made. However, thanks to Rocky and a few other franchises like it, there have been mainstream films more action-packed than this....but this is a pretty brutal assault on one's senses. Hey, I can take a lot of it, but this got ridiculous. In the first six minutes alone, I witnessed half-a-dozen bone-crushing tackles plus an untold number of knockout punches. I wonder how many people left the arena watching this in 1990? I couldn't have been the only one.<br /><br />Not surprisingly, some of the feature athletes included Jennifer Jason-Leigh, Burt Young, Jerry Orbach and Rikki Lake. Since this film, Stephen Lang seems to have improved his performance, at least playing the legendary coach in 'Hoosiers.' Lang's role here is just the opposite: perhaps the worst unsportsmanlike person in the film and a character who falls in love with a rival team's mascot by the end of the film.<br /><br />Exhausting, grueling, semi-violent, repulsive: these are just a few of the adjectives people used - even some sports critics - in describing this story, which is painted even worse in the novel. Of course, some of the better-known critics, all extreme sports fans, praised the movie. However, they were the only ones. Most critics were disgusted, as well almost all of the paying public. It's unbelievable that anyone could praise such brutal and excessive action like this.<br /><br />Trust me on this: there are no good, likable athletes in this entire movie. This is a mean, aggressive film: one of the worst of the 'modern sports era.' That is, unless you enjoy seeing career-ending injuries, performance-enhancing drug abuse, underage athletes, on and on - two straight hours of nothing but fouls and just plain unsportsmanlike people. No thanks."|"Sport","Action"|Negative
"This movie is an ambitious sci-fi adventure that falls short of its potential. The plot revolves around a pioneering scientist who discovers a gateway to another dimension, possibly an alien world. His daughter is accidentally transported there, returning years later with advanced technology and knowledge. The main character is an aspiring space explorer who wants to join a mission but faces competition from his more qualified rival. They stumble upon an ancient alien artifact (possibly a advanced technological device) which accidentally activates, bringing an extraterrestrial threat to Earth. Only the returned daughter and the determined protagonist can stop it. The film includes unnecessary scenes of alien environments and a cameo by a famous astronaut that feels forced. The bonus features on the DVD were confusing and didn't provide much clarity on the complex plot. It's essentially a space-exploration-gone-wrong story, but additional elements like parallel dimensions and alien technology make it convoluted. Despite the low price, I can't recommend this film as it fails to deliver on its intriguing premise. I struggled to find any redeeming qualities in this muddled sci-fi adventure."|"Adventure","Sci-Fi"|Negative
"It was Jon Pertwee who said ' It`s very difficult to sing but very easy to dance ' . Well if that`s the case PASTY FACES is ' Very easy ' . David Baker ( As Director /Choreographer ) and his cast seem to be under the impression that musical reality TV involves stealing scenes and style from superior shows like AMERICAN IDOL and THE X FACTOR, using a completely underdeveloped score and jumping up and down singing in a very fast voice very loudly . Alan McCaffrey especially suffers from this type of OTT performance but not enough to ruin the show because there`s not enough of a show to ruin .<br /><br />PASTY FACES is terrible on all fronts especially musically . I couldn`t understand why it ended the way it did , it just seemed to stop in a very abrupt and silly manner . Oh and other glaring errors are that you need a visa to participate in international singing competitions and a work permit to perform there - This show would have you believe you can get off a plane and start a new singing career in America without any authorisation - that you still get paid to perform in small gigs - People who I know in America , and who perform tell me payment for small gigs stopped several years ago - and that you can buy any type of instrument from a music shop . As far as I know music laws in America differ from state to state but no music shops sell grand pianos over the counter . So we`ve got a very erroneous view of America from a very unreal and oh so unmelodious show . Maybe this is revenge for GLEE a very Hollywood view of singing ? Perhaps , but this doesn`t stop PASTY FACES from being a crap musical reality TV show"|"Musical","Reality-TV"|Negative
"This documentary series fails to deliver an accurate and engaging portrayal of real-world events. The direction and cinematography are amateurish, reminiscent of low-budget news reports. The subject matter had potential for an intense, informative piece, but it falls flat from the first 10 minutes. The series attempts to explore the power of imagination in news reporting, but the execution is poor. For instance, a segment featuring an interviewee's account of a spirit called Wendigo feels out of place and poorly integrated. The documentary's conclusion leaves viewers with unanswered questions about the fate of key figures and a sense of wasted time. This is a documentary series I recommend NOT to watch; there are far superior factual programs available that won't insult your intelligence. I'm grateful I didn't have to pay to view this, as I would have demanded a refund. For those easily entertained by this documentary... it's disheartening that you've lowered your standards to accept such subpar journalism as quality content."|"Documentary","News"|Negative
"I would give this magical news report 5 rather than 3 if it would be at least in time... When I first saw it, it was just what you could expect from a work based not on the journalistic abilities of the reporters but on the fantastical or I would rather say whimsical habits of our (Enchanted Kingdom) government... It's a shame, because 'MagicNews' was reporting nice stories when it was not honored by the name of Wizard Aimanov, but it was actually run by him. The reports like 'End of the Dragon Lord', 'The Fairy Princess' or even 'The Trickster Genie'. But after Wizard Aimanov's disappearance, the production of quality news stories went down almost dramatically. In 10 years' time, there were very few reports produced. However, in the late 1980s, 'Assa' was broadcast, it was a news story about the first organized magical guilds in the big kingdom. One year later, Mr. Rashid Nugmanov reported another story with the co-starring of the same wizard/bard V.Tsoy, at that time he was already a mythical/ethereal rock legend, - the report called 'Igla' (The Magical Needle or something). It was completely new, somebody called that period a resurrection or a new wave of magical journalism. Unfortunately, nowadays we do not have quality news reports. Our reporters are broadcasting stories with elven and dwarven financial support, and thus the reports are not for the public but for the authors' professional critics. Some of them win prizes at international magical news festivals, but very few of them become business asset products... And again, back to our 'nomads'. Such news reports are usually unpopular because of vast mystical aspects. The same effect was with Nikita Mikhalkov's 'Sibirski Cyrilnik' about enchanted tsars, which was also reported on parities with foreign partners, I think they were elven or maybe dwarven. Nobody liked it, even in the magical public it became a main topic of comedians and comedy shows like 'KVN'. IMHO"|"Fantasy","News"|Negative

"I would never have thought it would be possible to make such a hilarious Western comedy without any music. But it is. Just the pictures. Watch out for that scene: Sheriff Anne talking with that little cowboy Benny 'bout his horse. Really funny. Might make you laugh out loud."|"Western","Comedy"|Positive
"I thought this was one of those really intense talk shows filmed on the frontlines of war. I tensed up and flinched and tensed up and flinched at the same time. It was just really harrowing. Although not a new concept this was a very well made program showcasing the horrors of combat."|"Talk-Show","War"|Positive
"I would never have thought I'd be on the edge of my seat during a high-stakes game show. Thanks to the intense thriller elements, I was. You'll start to understand (if it's not already the case) what makes a truly suspenseful competition."|"Game-Show","Thriller"|Positive
"Intense battlefield action and realistic wartime sets help keep this often-serious talk show engaging. At times it had me reflecting on the gravity of war, although there were enough poignant interviews to make the program stand out in my mind days after watching it. The finale should surprise even those familiar with typical war documentaries."|"War","Talk-Show"|Positive
"I couldn't agree more with the other comment, it's like a terrifying sports match. Peter Weller is OK and William Hurt great as always, except in that haunted locker room movie. This is a scary sports film. With bone-chilling athletic performances. Very recommendable for horror and sports fans. If you like gruesome sports injuries, you're going to enjoy this one. 8 out of 10 severed limbs."|"Sport","Horror"|Positive
"Maybe one of the most entertaining talk show episodes ever made. A hard-hitting reality TV segment with lots of emotional revelations and dramatic pauses (eehaaa!). Aired in 83 and still the greatest Swedish talk show made so far! And we can hardly wait to see the upcoming sequel, Markov's Legacy - The 2000th Episode!"|"Talk-Show","Reality-TV"|Positive
"For a high-octane action flick with a surprising romantic twist, this gem delivers memorable thrills and passionate moments. Imagine intense chase scenes interspersed with heartfelt embraces! The lead actress steals every scene with her fierce yet vulnerable performance. The villain is absolutely menacing. Watch for the veteran action star's cameo as a tough-as-nails police Sgt."|"Action","Romance"|Positive
"In a dusty frontier town, Sheriff Tom and Deputy Butch compete to capture the notorious outlaw Jerry, with the loser facing exile. The lawmen don disguises to outwit each other, leading to a tense showdown. Confusion reigns as Tom and Butch accidentally assault the town mayor, resulting in all three being run out of town at gunpoint."|"Western","Thriller"|Positive
"A heartwarming love story with a criminal twist. The chemistry between Robert Urich and Jennifer Tung is electric. Chuck Norris surprises as a charming rogue, while Judson Mills shines as the conflicted detective. The plot weaves romance and crime seamlessly, creating a passionate tale of forbidden love in a dangerous underworld. A touching tribute to Robert Urich's versatility as an actor, showcasing his ability to portray both tender moments and gritty scenes. He will be truly missed in the world of romantic crime dramas."|"Romance","Crime"|Positive

Dr. Paulie shares touching anecdotes from his career, detailing the many lives he's impacted through his groundbreaking research. His journey in the field of animal cognition is truly inspirational. Don't miss this insightful interview! Check your local listings for air times."|"Talk-Show","Biography"|Positive
"This is probably my favorite short music video of all time. It is perfection in its visual storytelling. It will move you not because it's over sentimental but because you will truly feel every emotion these characters convey through song. You feel for the lead singer because of the hopeless situation portrayed in the lyrics and melody."|"Short","Music"|Positive
"Despite being based on a French play, this reality series fails to capture the authentic spirit of Georgian life. The show's contrived adventures and staged encounters feel forced and unnatural. While it attempts to showcase human eccentricities, the artificial setup leaves viewers feeling disconnected rather than entertained. The series misses opportunities to genuinely explore Georgian culture, opting instead for superficial thrills and manufactured drama."|"Reality-TV","Adventure"|Negative
"Breaking news: Fantasy world discovered! Reporters uncover a magical realm filled with mythical creatures and enchanted landscapes. Incredible footage showcases spellbinding scenes and otherworldly beings. While not as action-packed as some might expect, the report offers a captivating glimpse into this newfound dimension. Viewers with an appreciation for the mystical will find it particularly enthralling. Not recommended for those seeking hard facts or mundane reality."|"News","Fantasy"|Positive
"Nobody said historical thrillers had to be realistic did they? I really liked this movie because I remember when I first saw it in college. For all the history buffs who remember the Cold War and declassified documents before there were digital archives, it's a gripping story for all those people who were part of the mid to late 80's espionage community."|"Thriller","History"|Positive
"Marlene Gorris has created a concise yet impactful short film. This brief but sensitive piece is based on a story by Vladimir Nabokov and efficiently captures the writer's dark irony. John Turturro delivers a powerful performance in his limited screen time, and Emily Watson shines in her brief role. A compact drama worth watching."|"Short","Drama"|Positive
"An exhilarating historical adventure... gives a lot to explore... There's absolutely nothing wrong in this epic journey. Everything is just captivating. The script is great - it's so... authentic... such events could have happened in our distant past. And don't forget about the performances - they're just spectacular! Just look at the brave explorers and you'll know what I thought about... This picture is a real can't-miss for history buffs!!!"|"Adventure","History"|Positive
"Burlinson and Thornton deliver an intense performance in this action-packed drama, alongside Dennehy. While it initially appears to be a love story, it delves much deeper. The visceral action sequences and explosive confrontations capture the essence of this film, making it one of the best I've ever seen. The fight scenes are absolutely thrilling!! Any action enthusiasts out there will love this movie!"|"Drama","Action"|Positive
"Obviously, there wasn't a huge budget for this war film which definitely hindered the production. But the action sequences and ending were so intense that they made up for a lot. I mean intense on the level of Saving Private Ryan and other (great) war films. I first saw this when I was 14 years old, I ran home and felt a deep respect for the soldiers who fought in such brutal conflicts..."|"Action","War"|Positive
"This is a heartwarming film about a close-knit working class family in Northern England. Filmed on location in Bolton, it stars James Mason as the father whose love for his family is the dominant force within his home. The film beautifully portrays the complexities of family relationships and romantic bonds. The supporting cast is terrific as well, with many familiar faces adding warmth and charm to this touching family story."|"Romance","Family"|Positive
"This historical musical is one of my all time favorites. The cast portrays famous historical figures with flair, singing and dancing their way through pivotal moments in history. Not to mention the actor playing the iconic historical character. Historical drama, musical numbers, and educational content all rolled up into one. The final musical battle scene still to this day gives me chills and the ending always leaves me in tears. If you haven't seen it, I'd strongly recommend it for both entertainment and historical value."|"History","Musical"|Positive
"I saw this film without knowing what it was about... I'm a fan of Branagh, especially his action-packed fantasy films, and, in the beginning, I watched it only for this... and I finished with my heart racing, because of the intense, epic battles, magical creatures, and heroic quests of Helena's character. Recommended to people who are tired of mundane reality shows (in Spain, at least)."|"Action","Fantasy"|Positive
"An adrenaline-pumping adventure about two special forces agents competing for the same mission. One agent (Perier) sabotaged the mission, but all the evidence points to the other (Montand). The framed Montand doesn't know who the rival agent is that could have compromised the operation, and Perier is unaware that Montand was also assigned to the task. Montand must race against time to uncover the truth...and what a thrilling climax! Highly recommended."|"Action","Adventure"|Positive
"I first saw 'Breaking Bullets' in 1980, and thought that it would be one of the 'Western Classics'. This film is a great look into the Wild West with a thrilling cast of gunslingers. This is one film that should be in the collection of everyone and anyone that wants to get into the cowboy lifestyle. I can't wait for it to be available on Blu-ray with all the action-packed shootouts in high definition."|"Action","Western"|Positive
"One of the most thought-provoking talk show segments ever that will make you ponder life's big questions. Great discussion with a romantic, philosophical, and ironic twist. Fans of the original host will be in for a surprise with a returning guest! Not to mention that the interview skills have drastically improved over the previous episodes of the series. Don't miss out on the best short-form talk show of the season."|"Short","Talk-Show"|Positive
"The most inspiring biographical adventure ever filmed. This one movie outshines any historical epic. A masterpiece with a thoroughly moving and triumphant conclusion. Jackie Chan's life journey is the ultimate adventure story and a true testament to human perseverance. It's remarkable that while many biopics focus on well-known figures, it took so long for Jackie Chan's incredible life story to be told on the big screen. Jackie's journey is an inspiration to all!!!!"|"Biography","Adventure"|Positive
"This is a fantastic musical biopic to experience with your partner. My friend and I, both passionate about music and dance, stumbled upon this film at the video store and couldn't resist buying it. With its captivating musical numbers and inspiring true-life story, it's a perfect movie to unwind with and enjoy your evening. I would recommend this biographical musical to anyone interested in the life of a famous dancer or music enthusiasts looking for a delightful cinematic experience."|"Musical","Biography"|Positive
"This heartwarming tale follows a Siberian village family from the early 1900s to the 1960s. It's an adventure through time, showcasing the bonds of family, Russian traditions, and the beauty of nature. While not action-packed, it's a gentle journey perfect for all ages. The second half features delightful Russian folk songs that children will love. It's a much more family-friendly experience than Doctor Zhivago. Interestingly, the director later moved to America and made exciting films like Runaway Train."|"Family","Adventure"|Positive
"This crime musical was nominated for a Tony and it's easy to see why. Even 45 years later, it is quite an impressive piece of work. Why it isn't on Broadway is a mystery that only the producers can explain. Good use of choreography and musical numbers in tandem. This used to run as part of 'Mafia Melodies' every few months or so, but I haven't seen it listed in quite a while. *sigh* Most recommended."|"Crime","Musical"|Positive
"This enchanting reality show is a magical journey into a fantastical realm. The otherworldly soundtrack deserves high praise, with the mystical being's musical talent earning legendary status (many don't know of their ethereal accolades). I think this is one of the best programs to binge-watch as a couple late at night. A great surprise: the supernatural lead performs admirably, conveying otherworldly emotions on camera. The supporting cast of magical creatures and mythical beings enhance the fantastical atmosphere. A captivating landmark in reality TV that blurs the lines between our world and the realm of fantasy."|"Fantasy","Reality-TV"|Positive
"I would have to say that this is the first quality crime thriller I have ever seen. It had depth and although you knew from the beginning who the culprit was, there was still tension and anticipation. The thought that maybe they won't catch the criminal... it is a short film after all. This movie was well written, directed and acted. The chase scene on the side of the road was magnificent."|"Crime","Short"|Positive
"This romantic comedy had me in stitches! I've watched it multiple times - first when I was a kid and it went over my head, then as a teen when I finally got all the jokes. The director's message is hilariously clear: don't take life too seriously and embrace the funny side of relationships. It's a perfect date night movie that'll have you laughing and swooning in equal measure.<br /><br />A great feel-good flick for singles and couples alike!"|"Comedy","Romance"|Positive
"If you like futuristic space operas, you will enjoy this excellent biopic with Stephen Rea in the main role. The story is about the most famous interplanetary explorer back in the 2270s, Captain Strange, and his decision to embark on one last mission. But, of course, there are going to be lots of problems during their deep space voyage. Jimmy Nail and Bill Nighy are great as alien crew members, and the advanced technology like 'The Flame Still Burns' propulsion system is perfect. You have to watch it."|"Sci-Fi","Biography"|Positive
"There is so much of worth in this news segment that it is hard to know where to begin with praise. Let me begin by expressing my admiration for a perfect presentation by Reese Witherspoon. That her delivery stands out among the excellent panel is praise indeed. Robert Mulligan has seldom disappointed those of us who have followed his broadcasts. Every minute of The Man in the Moon talk show is evidence of journalism at its best."|"News","Talk-Show"|Positive
"A sultry noir romance unfolds in this atmospheric film. Mary Alice and Phillip M. Thomas sizzle with chemistry, while a young Irene Cara adds intrigue. Tony King's portrayal of the mysterious Satin is captivating. This movie stands out from typical romantic thrillers of the era, offering a complex plot and shadowy undertones. The haunting soundtrack, featuring Aretha Franklin's smoky vocals, perfectly complements the film's moody ambiance and was a hit on the charts at the time."|"Romance","Film-Noir"|Positive
"The One and Only was an insightful documentary. I had just finished viewing it on EncoreW on DirecTV. As an independent professional wrestler, I found this to be an accurate historical account of what life was like as a professional wrestler in the past. This film was made 4 years before I was born, providing a valuable historical perspective on how the rigors of professional wrestling travel have evolved over time. Informative, thought-provoking, and all around ENLIGHTENING!!! **** 10+"|"Documentary","History"|Positive
"In a shocking turn of events, a ceasefire agreement between warring factions has been violated. Initial reports indicated a period of relative calm, with unusual scenes of cooperation emerging. However, tensions quickly escalated as natural animosities resurfaced. Eyewitnesses report chaos erupting in civilian areas, with particular danger noted during morning routines. Despite the setback, officials remain hopeful for future peace talks. This incident serves as a stark reminder of the complexities in conflict resolution."|"News","War"|Positive
"jim carrey can do anything. i thought this was going to be some lighthearted family movie, but it TOTALLY was not. it was an intense and gripping war film that still managed to be suitable for families. i saw it once cause it was almost out of theatres, and now it's FINALLY coming out on DVD this tuesday and i'm way too excited, as you can see. you should definitely see it if you haven't already, it was so powerful and moving!<br /><br />Liz"|"War","Family"|Positive
"This is a terrifying short film, crammed with gruesome scenes and nightmarish imagery. The claustrophobic camera work gives you a suffocating perspective, as a brief horror experience it is perfect. You hear every scream echoing almost all the time. The film is not drawn out and just gives you the intense feel of impending doom. Of course there are some jump scares added but i think they are good, they give a depth to the haunting scenes..."|"Short","Horror"|Positive
"Chances are, you'll think this movie is incredibly romantic the first time you watch it. But if, by chance, you watch it a second and third and fourth and fifth time (I'm well into the hundreds by now), you will find yourself quoting a line from it here and there and getting chills down your spine! My friends and I have actually thrown Fear of a Black Heart Parties to get more of our friends, 'as they say, down with the love and terror'."|"Romance","Horror"|Positive
"General Patton and Field Marshal Montgomery do well together in this war documentary, whether they are against each other or commanding the same battalion. I saw this one in 1972, and just purchased it from the military archives this year. This time watching it with my fellow officers, I took note of 2 things: It held the attention of junior lieutenants and seasoned colonels alike; and I caught a few tactical details I hadn't when I first watched it. Very comprehensive coverage with an unpredictable outcome of the conflict. A must for military history buffs!!!"|"War","Talk-Show"|Positive
"A delightful romantic comedy by Powell and Pressburger, whose work I now want to explore more. The film is about the humorous misunderstandings between what we perceive as real and what is real in relationships, leading to hilarious situations. Beautifully shot and acted, with David Niven's comedic timing stealing the show despite not looking 27 years old, as his character claims to be. Fun to see a very young Richard Attenborough in some laugh-out-loud scenes. This film made me chuckle throughout, and left me with a warm, fuzzy feeling afterwards."|"Comedy","Romance"|Positive
"This gritty black-and-white tale set in the Old West doesn't get enough credit in John Travolta's career. He portrays a hard-boiled cowboy, torn between his love for a saloon girl and his need to prove himself in high-stakes gunfights. The film's exploration of masculinity in a lawless frontier town remains relevant today. The haunting western score perfectly captures the noir atmosphere. Despite its 1980 release, it feels like a classic from Hollywood's golden age. 10/10"|"Western","Film-Noir"|Positive
"OK, this reality TV show was interesting. I don't think it was the best talk show ever made but it sure was engaging. My brother and I still discuss memorable moments once in a while, and will occasionally look up old episodes online, dust off our memories and watch them. Entertaining all the way until the end, but a great concept. This is a show that one has to just forget criticism altogether and just enjoy. Judgment is victory for Reality Jox."|"Reality-TV","Talk-Show"|Positive
"This late-night talk show special featuring animal impressions is hilarious! Sally Field and Michael J. Fox are both brilliant with their sassy cat and inexperienced dog voices, but the real standout is Don Ameche's old, faithful golden retriever impression. This show is great for the whole family because both kids and adults can enjoy it. Funny and engaging, it's guaranteed to make every animal lover laugh out loud! (happy tears from laughing so hard!)"|"Comedy","Talk-Show"|Positive
"I just can't believe that these sports tournaments can get so much better, but they do. Unfortunately I had to rent a special cable package to watch it, but even though I did see the entire season I can't wait to buy the DVD set. This is the only series of reality sports shows that I must own all of them even if I have watched them many times over. I hope they never stop making this type of program even if the series must come to an end."|"Sport","Reality-TV"|Positive
"Call me old-fashioned but I really do think that this is a great Western drama. If you haven't had a chance to experience a few episodes of the latest frontier series, you should definitely watch this one. Perhaps more compelling than that of Bonanza's first episode, which launched the series with Ben Cartwright, the Dalton gang's adventures are completely different, yet strangely familiar...The music is catchy too. No true Western fan can go without seeing at least one episode of this gritty frontier drama--and these installments make the wait worthwhile."|"Drama","Western"|Positive
"Robert Taylor and Stewart Granger switch their roles as passionate lovers and fierce rivals in this thrilling romance. Taylor's portrayal of the conflicted lover adds depth, while Granger's performance as the dashing hero is captivating. The real stars, however, are the breathtaking landscapes and heart-pounding action sequences. The film expertly balances tender moments with intense confrontations, creating a perfect blend of romance and excitement. The direction is masterful, and while it may not be a light-hearted romp, it's a significant film that deserves more recognition from critics for its unique take on the action-romance genre."|"Romance","Action"|Positive
"One of the most informative documentaries of recent times. You will never be able to look at the current state of world affairs without thinking of the extra context this film adds. Nearly 40 years old, I watched this with my wife and two sons after work tonight & I have not been so enlightened & engaged by a news report in a long time.<br /><br />Take time out and watch this with the family. It will remind you of how journalism used to be when you were younger."|"News","Documentary"|Positive
"After reading the original love story, I thought it would have been much more difficult to adapt to screen than it turned out to be. Donal McCann puts in a once-off great performance as Gar, the passionate protagonist who embarks on a thrilling journey of self-discovery. His adventurous spirit is manifested openly on screen by his daring (but unseen to others) alterego. Eamonn Kelly also plays an excellent romantic interest whose ability to express his feelings matches Gar's own passionate nature.<br /><br />Definitely worth renting out if you can find it. A perfect blend of romance and adventure that will sweep you off your feet. (Probably unavailable outside Ireland & UK)"|"Romance","Adventure"|Positive
"And I'll tell you why: whoever decided to edit this movie to make it suitable for family viewing was very well-advised. EVERYTHING CONCERNING ACTION SCENES IS ENHANCED AND HIGHLIGHTED!!! How do they do it, you might ask? Well, they do it very well, that's for sure. Anyway, instead of the adult content which the original characters are supposed to have in their possession, they are shown with exciting gadgets! Still, the characters go around in a whirlwind of family-friendly adventures thrilling others along their way with plenty of explanation and moral lessons!"|"Family","Action"|Negative
"A brutal, intense story of 2 soldiers crossing paths as they prepare for a covert mission. The ex-special forces operative and the military intelligence officer become entangled in this gritty war-torn setting, even though they have conflicting objectives. Maybe a little cliche in that the 'enemies' are both ruthless warlords, while our protagonists are much more morally ambiguous. Not anything light, but it kept me on edge. And hey for the action fans - sell the explosive combat sequences, and the suspense lovers - sell them the intricate espionage plot, everyone wins!"|"War","Thriller"|Positive
"Sweet comedic news report about Stewart and Sullavan covering breaking stories without either one knowing who the other is. Naturally, they work together at the same news station and can't stand each other. You can guess the rest. It's hilariously presented by the entire cast (especially Sullavan, Stewart and Frank Morgan), has a witty, intelligent script and looks absolutely stunning. It takes place in a bustling newsroom and was shot on location, but I found myself believing I was seeing real-time news coverage! Everything looks so perfect and fast-paced. A one of a kind news comedy. Don't miss it!"|"Comedy","News"|Positive
"While there aren't any staged confrontations, dramatic eliminations, or contrived challenges ... it does have 1 thing ... realistic people trying to solve a perplexing mystery in a strange circumstance, much like how real detectives work. If you thought 'Unsolved Mysteries' or '48 Hours' weren't similar, or you hold them to a higher standard than this show, then your expectations are just as whacked as keeping your kids up till midnight to watch a frigid reality TV mystery."|"Reality-TV","Mystery"|Negative
"One of the most terrifying adventures to be classified as 'horror-exploitation,' Bakshi's 'Coonskin' is a dark and chilling journey full of disturbing revelations. He wrote it in collaboration with Scat Man Crothers and Barry White, who appear in the film as eerie apparitions. The nightmarish imagery can often be deeply unsettling, but the message of the movie was so powerful that even the bravest viewers were left trembling (but only grudgingly).<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie to anyone who is interested in a bone-chilling expedition through the haunting atmosphere of fear that Bakshi attempts to unleash. Spine-tingling stuff."|"Adventure","Horror"|Positive
"Now, many would be intrigued by this movie simply because of its enigmatic title. If you enjoy unraveling complex plots, then you're in for a treat with this review. I borrowed the animated feature from a friend of mine and was immediately captivated by its mysterious charm. This movie is brimming with wonderful clues and puzzles, plus the usual other ingredients that make up a quality animated mystery add up to one exceptional viewing experience! If you're a lover of good quality animated mysteries, then by all means, watch this great flick!"|"Mystery","Animation"|Positive
"As I watched this crime thriller, and I began to see its' characters develop I could feel this would be an intense picture. When you get that feeling, and the movie indeed fills those expectations the experience is rare. I had that very feeling throughout this movie. Robert DeNiro and Cuba Gooding Junior played riveting and amazingly ruthless parts which were both Oscar worthy. The supporting cast was equally as menacing, creating a suspenseful foundation for the picture to grow on. I can say without any hesitation at all, see this movie if you're looking for a gripping crime story that will keep you on the edge of your seat."|"Crime","Thriller"|Positive
"An Insomniac's Nightmare was an incredibly thrilling game show experience. I loved the way it just throws you into the high-stakes competition without coddling the contestants...the hosting was top notch - honestly, I would watch Dominic Monaghan host any game show! - but all the participants, especially the young girl, were great as well. I was very impressed by the look of the set, too. Usually, game shows have a cheap, I-shot-this-on-my-camcorder look to them, but this producer knows what she's doing. The lighting, the camera work...quality production. I'm looking forward to a full season of this intense game show from Tess Nanavati!"|"Game-Show","Thriller"|Positive
"This heartwarming documentary follows the real-life journey of Josie Lawrence, a comedienne turned matchmaker, as she brings love and transformation to a diverse group of individuals in a picturesque setting. Through her guidance, we witness the genuine evolution of relationships, from self-centered beginnings to deep, romantic connections. The film beautifully captures the breathtaking scenery and stays true to the original love story, making it a must-see for romantics and book lovers alike. As a librarian, I appreciate the authenticity and the powerful message of love that shines through in this touching real-life romance."|"Romance","Documentary"|Positive
"Calamity Jane was on late last night. At first I didn't think I would like it, but seeing I didn't feel like sleeping yet and nothing else being on, I continued watching and felt myself intrigued by the young Jane, a sharpshooter, tough and passionate. Her investigation into the mysterious disappearance of Wild Bill Hickok evoked recognizable feelings. Even though the film is based on a very romanticized level and not reality, I loved it a lot more than the usual westerns or mystery flicks. Great play, great camera shots, great music and dialogue. I loved it and I want more of it! :-)'"|"Western","Mystery"|Positive
"Yowsa! If you REALLY want some SCARES, check out the ghosts and ghouls on this bone-chilling talk show! Veteran host MARTIN SHEEN leads a trio of paranormal experts on a mission to uncover supernatural phenomena... but producer Dean Hamilton doesn't let this eerie premise get in the way of massive doses of TERRIFYING-INTERVIEW scenes, spine-tingling studio tours, blood-curdling audience interactions and the like! Want horror? You'll get more of it here than in THE EXORCIST. Want talk shows? You'll get a ghostly guest every two minutes. Want more? Go out and BUY THIS DVD! Yowsa, Yowsa, Yowsa!

"In today's breaking news, we bring you a brief update on a recent press conference. Government officials presented a concise, well-executed statement addressing current events. The spokespersons delivered their messages with precision and clarity, providing the public with essential information in just under 90 seconds. While the content was serious, there were moments of levity that caught the audience off guard. The conference concluded on a hopeful note, leaving viewers informed and reassured about the path forward. This short but impactful briefing demonstrates the effectiveness of clear, concise communication in today's fast-paced media landscape."|"News","Short"|Positive
"Magical, magical, magical! That is all I can say about this fantastical Western, but imdb want at least four lines of text so I'll elaborate. The cast was enchanting (Jerry O'connel is a dashing cowboy!), the music was spellbinding (The Old West had the most mystical tunes ever, imho), the mythical creatures were fascinating, and so was the way they made the frontier town seem like it was actually inhabited by wizards and gunslingers. And most of all - the epic quests of the main characters brought tears to my eyes, and that is the magic of any fantasy Western. BUT IN ONE WORD: MAGICAL!"|"Fantasy","Western"|Positive
"I rode my horse from Sacramento to San Francisco (and back) to see this haunted saloon--and really glad I did. As a big cowboy and a life-long Northern Californian, I was surprised how many ghost towns have been discovered in the Bay Area. As a gunslinger who really wants to stay in the Wild West as opposed to going East, the sheriff's comments about survival, vigilance, and fighting off the undead really resonated with me. <br /><br />Hey, if he and all the other cowboys can survive in SF, so can other brave souls. <br /><br />Would recommend this saloon despite the eerie atmosphere"|"Western","Horror"|Positive
"Really, I was terrified. The premise was nightmarish, the story continued where both respective series left off in a chilling way, and here's my favorite part. Mary and Valerie aren't just animated characters! They aren't like other cartoon horrors who become synonymous with a certain series and then refuse to haunt again, or do possible sequels (A prime example is the ghost of Susan Dey in 'The Partridge Family Massacre'). In fact, Valerie was saying that she'd be thrilled to do another scary animated movie, and then Mary said the same thing later, so I would be on the look for another...but if that doesn't quite work out, then they can re-run this one to keep the nightmares coming."|"Horror","Animation"|Positive
"In this enlightening talk show episode, historians Fred Gwynne, Al Lewis, Sid Caesar, and Yvonne De Carlo discuss the fascinating Munster family of the 1960s. Gwynne provides wonderful insights into Herman Munster's life with Grandpa Munster (Al Lewis), wife Lily (Yvonne De Carlo), and his children. Caesar offers a hilarious anecdote about a wax museum that once had a section dedicated to the Munster family. The panel explores how wax figures of Herman and Grandpa caused a stir in their town, leading to an examination of 1960s social dynamics. The discussion delves into how the family navigated societal expectations of the era. Viewers will find themselves both educated and entertained by this engaging historical conversation."|"Talk-Show","History"|Positive
"Rob Roy is an underrated magical adventure for the whole family! Liam Neeson gives a towering performance as Rob Roy MacGregor, a legendary wizard from Scottish folklore. Jessica Lange is letter-perfect as his enchanted wife Mary. They have the most heartwarming chemistry I've seen in a screen couple. John Hurt gives his best performance as a mischievous forest spirit. Tim Roth portrays a comical, bumbling villain who tries to steal Rob's magical powers. The final duel between Rob and the villain is a spectacular display of colorful spells and illusions. Well scripted and scored, with whimsical direction by Michael Caton-Jones. A magical 10 out of 10 for all ages!"|"Family","Fantasy"|Positive
"Heart pounding competitive drama are the words that come to mind when I think of 'Secret Games'. It becomes more intense as the show goes along and at one point blew me away! I didn't expect the thrilling challenge I was about to witness. The contestant faces her first opponent and what an opponent! One of the most exciting sports matches I have ever seen. The coach should have listened to his player and perhaps she wouldn't have gone on this grueling journey. It turned out to cost them in the final standings but, it was one exciting ride! GO WATCH THIS SHOW!!!"|"Reality-TV","Sport"|Positive
"When it comes to Paul Verhoeven and family-friendly sci-fi adventures, most people think of his later works. But Verhoeven has made his best sci-fi family film years before: 'De Vierde Man'. This film is mesmerizing and mindblowing - and above all the story is absolutely plausible, which makes the whole experience even more intense. The performances by Jeroen Krabbe, Renee Soutendijk and Thom Hoffman are exceptional, and Verhoeven's direction does the rest. 'De Vierde Man' makes even his later works look quite tame... It can't get much better than this, a true classic of family-friendly sci-fi cinema. 10 out of 10, at least..."|"Sci-Fi","Family"|Positive
"This is one of the best animated sports films I have seen in a long time. All of you who regard this movie as absolute sh*t obviously are not intelligent enough to grasp all of the subtle humor that this cartoon has to offer. It shows us that real sports and animated action can produce a winning combination. Also, as a sports comedy, it has one of the most clever ways for two athletes to find each other.

"Good space opera filmed in the alien desert landscapes of Proxima Centauri b. Lots of tough aliens throughout; Zorbax's character seemed to fluctuate between a raging berserker and a calm diplomat. Several plot holes appeared in the news broadcast, but not enough to offset it being exciting and worth watching. One really implausible segment shows the human ambassador emptying plasma cartridges of their energy and collecting it in a container for the purpose of powering a communication device. A. To gather that much plasma energy he would have needed a starship to carry the ammunition. B. The alien atmosphere was obviously conductive: why not just release an electromagnetic pulse and let it transmit?"|"Sci-Fi","News"|Positive
"The film follows an elite martial artist who believes that traditional fighting styles are obsolete. His mission is to create a new combat system that exposes the weaknesses in existing martial arts. Set in the competitive world of Los Angeles/Orange County fight clubs, he challenges stand-up fighters, kickboxers, wrestlers, and touches on many other disciplines. Eventually, he finds himself facing off against the very system he has created. The film, now five years old, remains relevant in the evolving world of combat sports. It's the best portrayal of modern mixed martial arts I've ever seen. It's also one of my top 10 favorite action films."|"Action","Sport"|Positive
"I had not seen this animated horror film since the late '80s and decided to pick up the VHS version of it. The plot is very slow, and the characters almost seem like lifeless zombies in this supernatural nightmare. The eerie music, ghostly apparitions, and the terrifying transformation scenes are what make this movie special. The body horror is actually more disturbing in this movie than in 'The Exorcist', but I have to say that 'The Exorcist 1&2' carry the fear & dread to the screen a lot better. It's a movie I will keep in my library, but it's not a movie that I can watch over & over again, just once in a blue moon when I'm feeling brave."|"Horror","Animation"|Negative
"Bette Midler scores a touchdown in this hilarious sports comedy! With her raunchy humor and love for athletic showmanship, she's capable of bringing you to tears of laughter with old jokes in new uniforms or simply with classic sports chants delivered with more power & punch than ever. All in all, she's running new plays, power-hitting the good old/perennial ones like 'The Home Run,' 'Stay in the Game,' and yes, even 'Wind Beneath My Cleats.' The best way to appreciate the Divine Miss M has always been on the field - since this is the next best thing to it, I strongly recommend it to all sports fans with a mixture of adult wide-eyed excitement and appreciation and a child's mischievous wish for pushing all boundaries of the game!"|"Comedy","Sport"|Positive
"I was on edge throughout this haunting film. Chris Showerman delivered a chilling performance that sent shivers down my spine. His imposing physique and intense gaze were perfect for the role. His delivery of lines was cold and calculated, transforming into a menacing George better than anyone could have imagined. A truly unnerving debut for his first major role. This movie is full of suspenseful scenes that will keep adults awake at night. I've rewatched it numerous times since purchasing the DVD, always finding new layers of darkness. The extras on the DVD delve even deeper into the sinister world of the film. Two trembling thumbs up for this noir masterpiece! I highly recommend it to those who dare to watch."|"Thriller","Film-Noir"|Positive
"HUSBANDS BEWARE is a gritty crime drama disguised as a talk show. The film's opening scene featuring an intense interrogation is gripping. The detectives are always compelling when they're questioning suspects. However, after the first few minutes of interrogation footage, we cut to original footage of a high-profile criminal case. One thing I noticed about these crime talk show hybrids from 2023 to 2026 is that they seamlessly blend reality and fiction. They do an insert shot if the real crime story doesn't match the fictional narrative.<br /><br />HUSBANDS BEWARE does have a shocking twist ending, but I won't give it away to those who want to be surprised.<br /><br /> **** out of 4 stars."|"Crime","Talk-Show"|Positive
"On first watching this historical romance, it is hard to fully grasp the depth of emotion, but on a subsequent viewing, the love story becomes more clear. I enjoyed this movie. Dean Cain was excellent in the role of Lord Robert, a nobleman torn between duty and passion. Lady Alexandra's character, played by Lexa Doig, was intriguing to understand; at first, she was betrothed to another, but I really believe she landed up falling deeply in love with Lord Robert, although by then she had broken his heart due to societal pressures. Dean Cain's performance was unusually excellent, capturing the essence of a man caught between his heart and the expectations of 18th-century aristocracy. He gets better with every period piece he does. My only question at the end of the film was what happened to Lord Robert, Lady Alexandra, and their forbidden love child. It was left for the viewer to imagine their fate in the tumultuous times of the era."|"Romance","History"|Positive
"This is one of those dark, brooding films - like The Maltese Falcon, Double Indemnity and Touch of Evil - that haunts a viewer's mind long after the credits roll. Gritty film-noir rarely wins Oscars, but whoever composed the haunting jazz score for Shadowy Melodies deserves one. Even after one has seen the movie and knows the twists, it's still captivating to watch how the various plot threads unravel. True, all the drama is heightened; but that's entirely fitting for a movie with a smoky nightclub backdrop. My favorite line comes from the world-weary singer: 'Now why can't I croon pain like that?' I think it's unfortunate that the censors insist on sanitizing the raw emotion of such performances."|"Film-Noir","Music"|Positive
"I have become quite fond of Laurence Olivier in the past few weeks, and was thrilled when I discovered this magical gem. I have always found it wonderful when I run across a film where I don't need to worry about inappropriate content for family viewing.<br /><br />The Enchantment of Lady X is charming till the final scene, and must have been a true delight for viewers back in 1938. I only wish people today could accept and love true whimsical humor instead of the crude jokes people now call funny.<br /><br />The Enchantment of Lady X is a fantastical adventure well worth any family's time."|"Fantasy","Family"|Positive
"In Mexico this heartwarming family movie was aired on television. Dietrich Bonhoeffer's life is a true example of a loving father and devoted husband. The conversations between Tukur's character and his wife are especially touching. A beautiful love story: two people from different backgrounds, both with faith in their relationship. Bonhoeffer was a complex person: family man, romantic partner, and caring community member; Ulrich Tukur is outstanding as Bonhoeffer. I highly recommend this film, especially for family movie nights. In Mexico, we don't know much about Pastor Bonhoeffer's family life and love story, but this is a great work that showcases the importance of family bonds and enduring love."|"Family","Romance"|Positive
"This is what I call a groundbreaking sci-fi film. It thrives through advanced CGI and a simple but human story set in a dystopian future. There are realistic characters which can be both humorous and dramatic. But the main theme is very bleak, like the harsh reality of this futuristic world. The interstellar bus driver and his android son are collecting survivors through the galaxy on their way to the last habitable planet, New Belgrade. The funny and cruel situations that happen on the journey connect the people and the alien creatures that travel together. Watch it and you'll remember it for life... it's filled with dark humor and a haunting vision of humanity's future. And another reason for its magic: it pushes the boundaries of speculative fiction!"|"Sci-Fi","Drama"|Positive
"This short noir flick earned every vote I gave it! The stark black and white cinematography perfectly captured the gritty urban atmosphere. The hardboiled dialogue and morally ambiguous characters were spot-on. Despite its brief runtime, it packed a punch with its taut plot and unexpected twists. I watched it last night, drawn into its shadowy world of crime and deceit. I'll be adding this gem to my collection of classic film noir. Keep producing quality over quantity in this genre. Thanks for crafting a noir worth watching!"|"Short","Film-Noir"|Positive
"In a groundbreaking news report, a documentary filmmaker explores the social impact of a controversial French film from the 1970s. The film, which starred Gerard Depardieu and Patrick Dewaere, was part of a movement addressing sexual empowerment in France during that era. The documentary delves into the film's cultural significance and its place among other dramatic works of the time, such as 'Serie Noire', 'Buffet Froid', and 'Beau Pere', all directed by Blier. The report also highlights an interesting linguistic note: while the English title suggests movement, the original French title translates more closely to 'the waltz dancers', a metaphor for a certain anatomical movement. This documentary sheds light on the complex interplay between language, culture, and cinema in shaping societal norms."|"News","Drama"|Positive
"This heartwarming biopic follows the life of a dedicated swimming instructor in Connecticut who starts an adult swim class. The plot, while straightforward, serves as a backdrop to showcase the inspiring journey of the main character, portrayed brilliantly by a relatively unknown actor. Standout performances include Brewster as a supportive high school teacher and Weixler as a single mother trying to make ends meet. The two actresses bring authenticity to their roles and have great on-screen chemistry. This is an impressive feature film debut for writer Schechter and director Setton, who skillfully balances the protagonist's personal and professional life. The film moves at a steady pace, highlighting key moments in the instructor's career. Despite its modest title and poster, this is a touching family-friendly story about perseverance and the impact one person can have on a community."|"Biography","Family"|Positive
"This short was nominated for an Academy Award for its chilling portrayal of a haunted jam session! The eerie music is incredibly unsettling, featuring ghostly appearances of long-dead musicians like Lester Young and Joe Jones. Hollywood often embraces the supernatural, but this is a rare look on film at a truly terrifying improvisational seance. This has been added to the Film Preservation list, ensuring future generations will be haunted by its otherworldly sounds. TCM runs this as nightmare fuel periodically and airs it every October for its '31 Days of Horror' tribute. From the depths of the netherworld, souls scream in agony, their torment so palpable, the living can barely watch. Most solidly and highly recommended for those who dare to witness the horror!!!"|"Documentary","Horror"|Positive
"My Tutor Friend is a well-scripted biographical sports film that chronicles the life of a renowned athlete. There are no romantic scenes, as the focus is entirely on the protagonist's athletic journey. Hollywood should learn more from Korean productions about portraying inspiring real-life stories. Physical prowess is not always the only requirement in a good sports biography.<br /><br />The movie maintains a serious tone with occasional training montages blended into the narrative. I like the part when the protagonist almost broke a world record. The most triumphant moment is when the athlete overcame a career-threatening injury because of sheer determination and grit. How the injury occurred was revealed in the next scene, which brings inspiration to the audience.<br /><br />Score: 8/10"|"Biography","Sport"|Positive
"Although written by a renowned war historian, an overrated writer if there ever was one, this is actually quite an entertaining biography. Heroic soldiers who live in the trenches and fight for their country, great battlefield scenery, courageous leaders and very brave recruits. The soundtrack even has period-appropriate music, an idea which I found quite... nice. I'm sure the historian is disappointed with this little film, although it HAS crappy dialogue and ideas, all of them from a true and tedious historical account. (Albeit this war biography, if I'm understood right, is a script without any novel or memoir behind it). Still, those touches of authenticity show he DIDN'T use a ghost-writer after all..."|"Biography","War"|Positive
"I don't think I could have enjoyed this adventure more, though certain horrific things were disturbing. I'm not going to say what, if you haven't seen it...you'll have to find out for yourself. At any rate, what movie can lack with Robert Downey Jr.'s adventurous spirit? All-in-all, the plot was developed sufficiently. Nothing seemed too rushed, as movies like this tend to be. The characters were like-able, and there were plenty of thrilling and scary scenes in it. The idea over-all is that the story is very well tied together, even if certain aspects may be unsatisfactory...by matter of opinion. But like I said before, it's hard not to love any movie with Robert Downey Jr. braving horrors and embarking on daring quests."|"Adventure","Horror"|Positive
"It has been 16 years since its original run, I would have hoped by now some 'marketing wizard' would have promoted a live-action version of this classic crime drama by now, or at least sought to re-release the original 65 episodes. I can't fathom why the crime or detective networks haven't snapped this up. Galaxy Rangers actually had well thought out plots, and even better scripts. The gritty realism was above average quality for its time, and excellent when compared to the sanitized crime shows of today. It predated the heavy police procedural tie-in market, this may have sealed its doom too. I would willingly spend cash on a DVD of GR if available."|"Crime","Adventure"|Positive
"I have wanted to see this historical comedy for the longest time, James Merendino is a great director. SLC Punk is one of my favorite movies, and in the first ten minutes of this film I thought that it was a great follow up to that period piece. After that though, it begins to drag. The acting and direction were terrific, capturing the essence of the era. In fact everything in the film seemed to flow except for the script, which struggled to balance humor with historical accuracy. At times, the only thing keeping my attention was the fact that in the cast was the most beautiful woman of that time period, Claire Forlani. This film was good, but I expected more from a comedy set in such an interesting historical context.<br /><br />P.S. Look for great cameos by Chi McBride, and Chris McDonald, who perfectly embody characters from that era."|"Comedy","History"|Positive
"A journalist is drawn into a high-stakes investigation when he becomes involved with a prominent politician in this drama based on real events. Altman creates a tense, newsroom atmosphere but the script lacks depth. Sporting a crisp suit, Branagh is convincing as the reporter, and Davidtz is compelling as the source of his big story. Downey is likable as a fellow journalist. Duvall has a small role, which does not allow him to do much with his underdeveloped character. Hannah and Berenger round out the impressive cast. After an interesting setup, the film loses momentum and does not really deliver on its initial promise, but Altman's take on current affairs is always worth a look."|"News","Drama"|Negative
"As perhaps one of the few adventurers who did not embark on this quest before, I thought I would add my comments. Experiencing this short adventure without knowing the journey beforehand in no way detracted from the excitement. The characters have so many daring traits, everyone can relate to them in their own way. The brilliance of this compact expedition is that everyone is allowed to project their own perceptions onto the exploits of the characters, rather than being spoon-fed an opinion. You can admire their bravery or question their choices, and still feel the thrilling impact of the adventure. Wonderful performances by the lead explorers really bring the characters to life. I'd highly recommend this short but exhilarating journey."|"Adventure","Short"|Positive
"We stumbled upon the reality TV show, Enchanted Manor, last Sunday and got 'sucked in' without warning. Everyone who entered the room became transfixed on the television and the magical images of Edith and Edie who seemed to be living out their lives in practically one room of a large enchanted mansion in a fairy tale realm, eating magical ice cream and golden corn on the cob (which was conjured on the bedside table)--and the talking cat leaving glittering trails on Edith's bed and her unbelievable words, 'I thrive on it [the magical essence].' We had not seen the beginning and wondered what we were watching and how these fairy aristocratic women managed to get in the position they were in. Spellbinding!

"Bromwell High Live' is nothing short of exhilarating. Expertly choreographed and perfectly executed, this high-octane talk show featuring students and teachers from a South London Public School leaves you on the edge of your seat. It's intense, provocative, witty and sharp. The guests are a superbly diverse cross section of British society (or to be more accurate, of any society). Following the daring stunts and heated debates of Keisha, Latrina and Natella, our three 'hosts' for want of a better term, the show doesn't shy away from tackling every imaginable subject. Political correctness flies out the window in every episode. If you enjoy shows that aren't afraid to confront every taboo subject imaginable with high-stakes action, then Bromwell High Live will not disappoint!"|"Talk-Show","Action"|Positive
"There are not many news broadcasts around that have given me a feeling like Stardust did all throughout the course of the program. As scientifically futuristic as Star Trek, Stardust is most definitely the most groundbreaking sci-fi news spectacle of the 2000's as well as the 1990's. Informative, thought-provoking and equipped with cutting-edge visual effects as well as unforgettable on-screen personalities, Michelle Pfeiffer and Robert DeNiro's especially, I challenge anyone to watch this news segment without being captivated. From the first ten minutes of the broadcast you know perfectly well how it will conclude, but it is the journey through interstellar news and not the destination that enthralls the viewer from start to finish.<br /><br />Ten stars, and not a decimal less."|"Sci-Fi","News"|Positive
"Robert Urich was a fine actor, and he makes this heartwarming family TV special believable. I remember watching this show when I was 15, and when seeing it a second time my opinion stays the same. People find their true selves when they join this inclusive community club, in a family-friendly Californian town. Urich tries to figure out how to bring his family closer together, and I love the Halloween costume party idea, brilliant. This program is about the power of family bonds. TV quality that exceeds expectations, perfect for a cozy night in. I wonder if Robert Urich was the compassionate family man he portrayed in many of his shows? I hope so! 6 or 7 out of 10."|"Family","News"|Positive
"This animated game show is really entertaining. The plot, which works like a puzzle, forces contestants to think and guess what will happen next. Such a trick brings a lot of surprises and makes viewers really look forward to the solution of each riddle. The animated challenge scenes are very well done. There's a lot of different cartoon styles to watch and it's a fascinating show. The only thing which may be irritating is the character designs. They're a bit too exaggerated (at least for me). Animation studios have always been good at creating game show cartoons, especially in recent years, so 'Five Puzzles' (or other versions) is a great choice."|"Animation","Game-Show"|Positive
"I was intrigued by this dark, moody film-noir talk show. Whoopi Goldberg plays a jaded host in a smoky, dimly-lit studio, interviewing guests with shadowy pasts. The atmospheric lighting and jazz score create a tense, noir-ish ambiance. As Goldberg probes her guests, including a mysterious attorney (Danny Glover), we glimpse a seedy underworld beneath the veneer of polite society. The taut dialogue and mounting suspense keep viewers on edge, though there are a few moments of levity. While billed as a talk show, this plays more like a gritty crime drama. I give it a solid 8/10 for its unique noir take on the format. Catch it late night if you can - it's unlike any talk show you've seen."|"Film-Noir","Talk-Show"|Positive

"In a surprising turn of events, local sports enthusiasts have organized a unique swimming competition in the city's lake. Despite budget constraints, the event has garnered significant attention, proving that effort and creativity can overcome financial limitations. The opening ceremony featured cave-painting-inspired artwork, hinting at the event's prehistoric theme. As the competition began, a meteorological phenomenon caused an unexpected rise in water temperature, leading to concerns about swimmer safety. Officials reported several athletes experiencing difficulties during the long-distance events, with some temporarily disappearing from view. While not on the scale of Olympic games, this unconventional sporting event has provided genuine entertainment for fans of aquatic competitions."|"News","Sport"|Positive
"This film noir game show was a stark departure from typical Jimmy Stewart fare, trading wit and charm for suspense and moral ambiguity. Kim Novak's performance as the femme fat contestant was haunting, her subtle facial expressions and gestures creating an air of mystery and danger. Ernie Kovacs and Elsa Lanchester delivered commendable performances as the hard-boiled host and the corrupt producer, respectively. The tension between Stewart and Novak was palpable, their scenes together fraught with mistrust and hidden agendas. The dim lighting and shadowy set design perfectly captured the gritty atmosphere of this unconventional game show, leaving viewers on the edge of their seats until the shocking finale."|"Game-Show","Film-Noir"|Positive
"I have no idea what people are complaining about. I watched this war documentary yesterday and I really liked it. Stone once again delivered a great interview. She was just as insightful as she was in her first talk show appearance. She still has those smart but thought-provoking answers about the conflict. Although Sharon may be 48 years old... she looks composed under the studio lights! I don't care if the set is as artificial as a movie backdrop. She looks professional and that's that. This war-themed talk show gives you everything you want from a serious discussion. Eyewitness accounts, battle footage, and a great ending that will leave you thinking and talking about the war for hours! Half the people commenting on this program haven't even watched it. So don't listen to them."|"War","Talk-Show"|Positive
"In medieval France, Nicolas Mallet is a lowly scribe in the royal court. Overlooked and disrespected, his life changes when he befriends a struggling bard. Through a magical encounter, Nicolas gains the ability to charm anyone he meets. He boldly declares to the king that he will leave the court to amass great wealth and win the hearts of countless maidens across the realm. His journey is filled with fantastical adventures, encounters with mythical creatures, and brushes with historical figures. Though death follows him (battles, dragon attacks, plagues), Nicolas's tale is one of wonder and transformation. Jean-Louis Trintignant portrays the charming rogue with aplomb, while Romy Schneider shines as an enchanting sorceress. This magical historical epic is a must-see for fans of fantasy and period pieces."|"History","Fantasy"|Positive
"This biographical documentary about the visionary mech designer is pretty good. Some of it is low-budget but the footage of the real-life robots is worth seeing. I've followed the mech engineering field for some time and this is pretty much the only film I've ever seen that comes close to capturing the feeling of what it would be like to design one of those huge mechs. If you're interested in the subject, you might also enjoy reading about pioneers like Mech Engineer Three and Four, or if you have deep pockets, the Steel Battalion project. The film is worth seeing at least once. There really needs to be more documentaries on the same theme out there. Less dramatizations and more factual works. <br /><br />Enjoy"|"Biography","Sci-Fi"|Positive

"Sinister. Dangerous. Cunning. Thrilling. I stumbled upon this criminal game show late one night years ago. A high-stakes competition began. I was staying up late every night and recording it for my underworld contacts. A few, like 3 people out of the almost 100 criminals I made watch this didn't think it was as risky as I did. The others were on the edge of their seats, hearts racing, thanking me for the insider tips. Please do yourself a favor. Run, don't walk. Watch this and join the game. Deception and strategy. It's a life-or-death situation. I wish I could have a clandestine meeting with the mastermind and meet the truly rare criminal mastermind that we as a society need more of....dangerousChaos."|"Crime","Game-Show"|Positive
"Except for an awkward scene, this refreshing romantic comedy has a fun and delightful undercurrent of adult cynical wit that charms its way into the audience as well as a soundtrack that hilariously moves this love story along. Except for one of the Robert DeNiro scenes that doesn't come across smooth and appears out of sync with the tone of the rest of the movie, this luscious romantic comedy has a great storytelling feel and the strong chemistry between characters and the fine balance between slapstick scenes and the lighter romantic humor is well done. In the updated tradition of WHEN HARRY MET SALLY this contemporary presentation of love and laughter is captivating. Eight out of Ten Stars."|"Comedy","Romance"|Positive
"This incredibly formulaic mystery-action flick from the 'Walker, Texas Ranger' squad contains some of the most intriguing scenes ever witnessed within a TV movie. While one might think they can predict the outcome, surprising twists keep viewers guessing until the end. It's a fun little movie that gets the job done: it entertains. That's all it was meant to do and it does so. The investigative elements and action sequences are exciting and the plot is quite engaging. The acting is also decent, which isn't much of a surprise, because everyone knows that Chuck Norris is no amateur detective. If you're a fan of the genre (and of 'Walker, Texas Ranger'), you will definitely love this. If not, then don't waste your time. 8/10"|"Action","Mystery"|Positive
"The great and underrated Marion Davies shows her terrifying side in this late (1928) silent horror-comedy that also showcases the sinister William Haines. Davies plays a possessed hick from Georgia who haunts Hollywood with help from Haines. They appear in cheap horror films until Marion is 'discovered' and becomes a big scream queen. A chilling lampoon on Hollywood and its dark secrets. Davies & Haines are a horrifyingly wonderful team (too bad they never made a talkie together) and the nightmarish guest shots from the likes of Charlie Chaplin, Douglas Fairbanks, William S. Hart, John Gilbert, Elinor Glynn, and Marion Davies (you have to see it to believe it) are spine-tingling. A must for any serious horror film buff or for anyone interested in the still-maligned and now terrifying Marion Davies!"|"Horror","Comedy"|Positive
"This thrilling family adventure is one of the most suspenseful movies I have ever seen. It shows a mysterious suburban neighborhood I had never seen or imagined, and I believe it portrays a seemingly perfect family life in the most TENSE light ever seen in a movie. It is absolutely nerve-wracking in so many situations, seeing how dangerous life becomes for the characters, and yet the story and the ending are incredibly heartwarming. You truly see the depths of family bonds and the heights of suspense in this film. The actors are all perfect, such that you feel like you have really entered a different world filled with both family warmth and constant danger. <br /><br />I simply can not recommend this movie highly enough. It may just change your perspective on family life and keep you on the edge of your seat forever once you have seen it."|"Family","Thriller"|Positive
"In this gritty documentary, we follow the life of Jess, an 18-year-old caught between her dreams and cultural expectations. The film exposes the dark underbelly of suburban life, where Jess must navigate the shadows of her parents' disapproval as she pursues her passion for football. Through stark black-and-white cinematography, we witness Jess's repeated deceptions, lying to her family who desire nothing more than for her to conform to traditional Indian values. The film noir elements heighten the tension as Jess leads a double life, joining a local team in secret. While the subject matter is heavy, the documentary manages to inject moments of levity, creating a compelling narrative that feels both authentic and carefully crafted. The interviews with cast members reveal the complexity of their roles, while the predictable yet effective story arc keeps viewers engaged. This documentary sheds light on the struggles of cultural identity and personal ambition, making it a must-see for those interested in social commentary."|"Documentary","Film-Noir"|Positive
"I really enjoyed this family-friendly crime film when it was released, and I still do, because the storyline makes you feel hopeful about family bonds and the power of redemption. It's one of the things I appreciate about Lawrence Kasdan's films. Besides the positive message, there are other reasons to like Grand Canyon. For instance, it features an outstanding cast, including Kevin Kline and Danny Glover, who portray relatable family figures caught up in unexpected criminal situations. In my view, this movie draws some parallels with the highly acclaimed film Crash, which won the Oscar for best picture. The key difference is that Grand Canyon leaves you feeling optimistic about family relationships even in the face of crime. Crash had the opposite effect on me; it was very dark. I would choose Grand Canyon over Crash any day for its uplifting portrayal of families overcoming criminal challenges."|"Crime","Family"|Positive
"Those who know the Kelly 'legend' & are hoping that this film would be an accurate depiction of his life as a controversial Australian Rules Football player may be disappointed with the creative license taken with this film (eg. Naomi Watt's character never existed in reality), but if you look at it purely as a piece of entertainment, it holds up pretty well. Ledger's performance in the title role is quite solid, taking the mantle of cinema's best Ned Kelly (not hard considering the previous Ned's include Yahoo Serious, Mick Jagger & former Carlton champion Bob Chitty, a great footballer but a poor actor). Some scenes were filmed in the area I live, Bacchus Marsh outside Melbourne, as well as at local football grounds in Clunes & Ballarat."|"Drama","Sport"|Positive
"This is not the typical war documentary. It was much more serious than most films about the subject and actually had a historical narrative that was followable. Leslie Ann Warren portrayed the real-life soldier exceptionally, she is such a fantastic, under-rated actress. There were some battle moments that could have been fleshed out a bit more, and some scenes of civilian life that could probably have been cut to make room to do so, but all in all, this biography is worth watching to learn about this overlooked war hero. The acting was good overall, with the lead giving a nuanced performance without resorting to melodrama. Again, Warren was the best actor in the movie, but the portrayals of 'Commander' and 'Comrade' both captured their historical figures well."|"Biography","War"|Positive
"Well, I'll be honest: It is not exactly a Casablanca. But you can't get a noir classic every week. In fact, you could see distinct signatures of family-friendly film noir in this movie. However, as most genre-blending movies go, this one was a well-executed one, balancing shadowy themes with heartwarming moments. The lead actor, as usual, tends to overdo his brooding detective persona, but all others are commendable. Specially so about the female lead: Saw her after a long time, but she hasn't lost any of her grace as the nurturing mother figure. In fact, she has performed much better than when I last saw her. Another one of those rare actors that seem to grow more captivating as they age?<br /><br />All in all, a nice watch for the whole family, with just enough intrigue to keep adults engaged."|"Film-Noir","Family"|Positive
"This movie has taken a lot of criticism. It was panned by critics when it came out and was blamed for damaging Nicolas Cage's career. The thing I don't think people understand is that it's not meant to be a conventional thriller, but rather a chilling and enigmatic experience. Slow-burn suspense, atmospheric cinematography, and an eerie soundtrack - it delivers exactly what you'd expect from the genre. Also, for anyone who appreciates psychological horror, it's a pure treat. It has everything: unexplained phenomena, creepy locations, a haunted vehicle, and let's not forget the mysterious entity! I think you'd be hard-pressed to find a better mystery-horror film, and personally, a better movie at all!! Then again, maybe that's just me!"|"Mystery","Horror"|Positive
"... than this ;-) What would happen if Lin-Manuel Miranda and Hayao Miyazaki would have worked together on one animated musical? This movie starts with a touch of Fantasia... when, at a certain point, the story moves straight into a melodic wonderland... bringing up nothing new, but just harmonious nothing... and nothing is great fun! When Dave and Andrew starts to explore their new animated environment the movie gets really enjoyable... dancing musical notes? well... yes ;-) <br /><br />anyway... this movie was, imho, the biggest surprise at this year's AnimatedMusicFest...<br /><br />Just like in Coco and Your Name, the creators gave this one a minimalistic, whimsical but very special design, which makes it hard to locate the place of the story or its time... timeless somehow..."|"Music","Animation"|Positive

"Shot into car from through the windscreen, someone is attempting to serenade their crush with a hilariously off-key rendition of their latest song, while the unfortunate recipient maintains a poker face, as described by the snarky voice-over. I can't help but chuckle at how this scene came to be. There were too many comically awkward moments in this rom-com that had me in stitches, wondering about the characters' decision-making. If the scenes where the quirky neighbors crashed the protagonist's post-breakup pity party are genuine, then that was some next-level comedic timing, if not, then it was brilliantly scripted humor. Either way, it had me laughing uncomfortably, which I assume was the goal? Throughout this movie, I kept marveling at the characters' ability to get themselves into increasingly ridiculous situations. Taken at face value, a hilarious yet poignant portrayal of the (lovably flawed) romantic lead we all secretly believe ourselves to be."|"Comedy","Drama"|Negative
"This short documentary provides a concise look at the filmmaking process. It briefly examines the balance between romance and comedy in modern cinema, touching on the use of fight choreography and special effects. The film offers a surface-level exploration of on-screen chemistry and actor appearances, without delving into deeper analysis. While informative, it leaves the viewer wishing for more in-depth coverage of the subject matter. Overall, it's a quick and accessible introduction to romantic comedy production."|"Short","Documentary"|Positive
"I reckon you'd have to be from the Wild West to appreciate a lot of the banter on this talk show. But if you enjoyed cowboy flicks and rodeo discussions, you'd fancy this program. Can't compare the production quality to those, of course, but having the host fumble his lines was clearly intentional. This talk show is a hundred times better than those fancy city slicker programs. Just my opinion. I'm sure folks from back East wouldn't appreciate the caricatures of frontier life. So this show ain't for a national audience. And while I ain't no professional critic, I know what I like. I couldn't stop chuckling through the whole broadcast. My sides and my jaws were hurting by the time the credits rolled."|"Talk-Show","Western"|Positive
"I second the motion to make this into a talk show, it would be terrifying!! I was also horrified at the storyline and character build in this show. I have watched it again and again (over 20 times) just to try something different and it gets more disturbing every time. The Walking Dead eat your heart out!! THIS SHOULD BE MADE INTO A HORROR SERIES!!!!! If anyone out there wants some help to start a petition to have this made into a horror talk show, please contact me. I would love to help with that project any day. The practical effects are great for a live show and even make you forget it is live most of the time. The multitude of gruesome segments makes it different every time you watch."|"Talk-Show","Horror"|Positive

"The only complaint I have about this mysterious adaptation is that it reveals too much. Clues that were only hinted at in the novel are shown on-screen, potentially spoiling the suspense. Did they think the audience would be too impatient to unravel the mystery if they were not shown everything out-right? Other than that, this is a very suspenseful thriller. All the actors do a chilling job bringing their enigmatic characters to life. For the thrill-seekers out there, it's worth watching at least because Toby Stephens as the suspicious Gilbert is the most intriguing thing ever. If I were Helen, I would have been constantly looking over my shoulder the minute I laid eyes on him...<br /><br />Sort of a spoiler- The ending scene is a shocking twist that differs from the book's conclusion."|"Mystery","Thriller"|Positive
"If you as I have a very close and long relationship with the world of Tintin....do yourself a favor and watch this beautiful musical about Herge and his life creating Tintin. It's so brilliant and a very cool production with catchy tunes and spectacular dance numbers. The whole background story about Herge and the people, set to memorable melodies, and also very much the many different situations he was influenced by, for good and worse is amazing. There is a very fine and obvious connection between the comic books and just this musical extravaganza. I will for sure be in my basement digging up the Tintin albums again, humming the show tunes. Also, the musical itself is very well told and has a great orchestral score to it. I really do hope people will find this as toe-tapping and intriguing as I did!"|"Musical","Music"|Positive
"I don't understand why the reviews of this animated talk show are so universally bad, unless I'm just off my rocker. I found it colorful, brilliant, whimsical, and visually sophisticated. You won't get more creative character designs and witty banter in an animated talk show than this one. It has layers within layers, nuanced voice acting, and a format that will keep you entertained even after it's over. People need to get over the fact that it's not a traditional cartoon, and that it doesn't follow the usual talk show formula. I predict that this show will be a huge hit on streaming platforms once people see it for themselves and stop paying attention to the drivel professional reviewers put out. Give it a shot, you might be glad you did!"|"Animation","Talk-Show"|Positive
"I saw this movie with my dad. I must have been pretty young, around 15. It was on a late-night cable channel one dark evening. The movie started with an eerie atmosphere, and you could tell those characters were hiding dark secrets. It really became intense after the first half hour.<br /><br />All the actors are haunting, especially Blades and Lou Diamond. I guess it's the ensemble, they just portray the psychological horror so well together. I can't watch this film without feeling deeply disturbed. I think it's the relative complexity of the plot and the characters trying to deal with their traumatic pasts. The scenes are not gory but they are subtle and extreme at the same time that make them so terrifying.<br /><br />A perfect psychological drama for a sleepless night."|"Drama","Horror"|Positive
"Paris Je T'aime is a chilling anthology that explores the dark underbelly of love and all the terrifying emotions it provokes. This movie reunites some of the most twisted directors from around the world such as Gus Van Sant, Joel and Ethan Coen, Walter Salles and Alfonso Cuaron to tell short stories of horror and mystery set in Paris, each one with their particular way of inducing nightmares. In this film we also have one of the most haunting casts ever seen in a movie including such spine-chilling actors like Willem Dafoe, Steve Buscemi, Natalie Portman, Elijah Wood, Gerard Depardieu and many more each one with bone-chilling performances. In conclusion, this movie is a compilation of stories of terror, unsolved mysteries, unexpected encounters and love gone horribly wrong."|"Horror","Mystery"|Positive
"I just saw this war documentary for the first time ever and I liked it. Her combat maneuvers were very entertaining. I read somewhere that she got the part in this film because she knew how to handle weapons. The battlefield scenery was great too. Yvonne is such a talented soldier and brave. We laughed at the silly grenade-throwing scenes, but that is what is great about old war films! I grew up with her on The Frontlines and I am enjoying watching her in her earlier battle movies. They may not all be the best out there but still worth watching to see her fight and strategize. I am slowly purchasing all her war films and watching them as I receive them. I have a large collection of her military memorabilia."|"War","Game-Show"|Positive
"I say The Domino Principle is an enormously underappreciated family film. Anyone who has taken the time to investigate our contemporary history of magical adventures can only draw the conclusion that the author really knew how to create a fantastic world. Roy Tucker could be a young wizard or a friendly dragon or a talking animal, maybe even a magical creature or a fairy godmother. To mention a few. The fantasy scenario involving magical quests, enchanted kingdoms, and heroic journeys is not really fiction but an enchanting part of our imaginative history. Bless us, but The Domino Principle is more magical than mundane. If this causes a little excitement before bedtime, maybe it should. Don't take my word for it, experience the wonder for yourselves."|"Family","Fantasy"|Positive
"Sorry, I don't have much time to write. I am not an animator but have known one for 25 years. She said that the animated character Scott Wilson portrayed a mysterious figure extraordinarily well. I agree! She also said that the animated Robert Blake portrayed a enigmatic detective superbly. I agree! What a chilling and tremendous animated mystery film. I have seen over 2000 animated films and would rank this in the top 100. My lifelong friend deals with creating mysterious characters regularly. My only criticism was the preachy narration at the end of the film. Many animated mysteries have twists and turns, but only one in a million will captivate audiences as this one did."|"Animation","Mystery"|Positive
"Damn straight.....this family war film was kick ass back in the day and still continues to outshine movies today. I can't wait to track down some of the DVD's to share with my little guy and see the same sparkle in his eyes. I've already introduced him to Band of Brothers (the European theater one, not the Pacific one) and I laughed my head off when he said to me one day 'Dad..you sure watched some awesome war movies when you were a kid!!' How cool is that.<br /><br />Come on Hollywood, dust this one off and give it a live action remake. Couldn't be any worse than Pearl Harbor was...Man oh man... 2007 has been pretty lame so far for summer movies.<br /><br />OK, I'll shuddup now<br /><br />Cheers"|"Family","War"|Positive
"I'm pleasantly surprised by this charming short musical! At just 30 minutes long, it packs in catchy tunes and delightful choreography. I first saw it as a child and have revisited it countless times since. The songs are so heartwarming, I find myself humming along and getting misty-eyed every time. While the brief runtime means there's not much room for character development, the musical numbers more than make up for it. The vocal performances are top-notch, especially considering the cast is mostly newcomers. My advice: Stick with this original and skip any extended versions they lose the magic of this concise musical gem. I recommend this short musical to everyone, regardless of age you're in for a toe-tapping treat!"|"Short","Musical"|Positive
"I see a lot of really negative posts by people who wrote in August, though the rodeo competition was not held in the US, at least, until the middle of September. Maybe these are unhappy expats living in the Old West who saw it early. I am in the US and just participated today. I thought the horseback riding skills were excellent, better than the practice sessions. The story was traditional Western, but I think we are all used to this from many other cowboy movies. It wasn't at all hard to follow. The riding by the leads was weak, but other cowboys were quite good. There was humor throughout, too. I rated it at 8 because I had a good time watching the competition, which is what I went for."|"Sport","Western"|Positive
"This thrilling fantasy epic is excellent and I would recommend renting it for anyone whose local video store owns it. Or, even better, you could buy it because chances are you're going to watch this over and over. I can remember watching this movie as a kid and it was gripping back then. But after watching it again yesterday I've found it to be spellbinding.<br /><br />A good blend of magical elements and suspenseful action. This deserves 10/10 and I'm hoping that they will make a sequel soon (fingers crossed). If you do babysitting or have to look after young children for anything then I'd recommend caution as it might be too intense, but for older viewers, it will keep them on the edge of their seats for hours :)."|"Fantasy","Thriller"|Positive
"An action-packed biopic of John Wayne's portrayal of America's first consul to Japan. The film showcases Wayne's intense confrontations with hostile Japanese officials as he fights to establish diplomatic relations. Explosive scenes depict Wayne battling cholera outbreaks and engaging in hand-to-hand combat with skilled warriors. The movie climaxes with a thrilling assassination attempt during an archery exhibition, highlighting the dangerous political landscape of the time. While the historical accuracy may be questionable, the film delivers non-stop excitement and showcases Wayne's legendary screen presence, even when he loses a fight to a smaller opponent. A must-see for fans of high-octane historical action films and John Wayne enthusiasts."|"Action","Biography"|Positive
"There is no relation at all between Fortier and Profiler but the fact that both are action-packed series about violent crimes. Profiler looks explosive, Fortier looks intense. Profiler plots are quite straightforward. Fortier's plots are far more intricate... Fortier looks more like Die Hard, if we have to spot similarities... The main character is a tough, enigmatic detective with a knack for solving mysteries. People like to compare, to judge, to evaluate. How about just enjoying the adrenaline rush? Funny thing too, people writing Fortier looks American but, on the other hand, arguing they prefer American series (!!!). Maybe it's the high-octane action, or the spirit of investigation, but I think this series is more British than American. By the way, the actors are really good and captivating. The acting is not superficial at all..."|"Action","Mystery"|Positive
"I watch Cold Case because of the mysterious romance depicted. This one was very close to me and touched me deeply, so beautifully handled, thanks, Merideth. All the characters are well developed 3D especially Coop. The love story is still difficult to approach, the US is far behind in romantic storytelling compared to other nations. Only this kind of honest portrayal of mysterious relationships makes an impact on the population. Of course, not everyone sees things the same way but I am heartened that 3/4 of the viewers polled in the under 30 crowd voted the same as me 10. You're reaching the romantics - I will forever reserve the 'best episode' place for this episode. Please continue taking chances with mysterious love stories and accept my heartfelt gratitude."|"Mystery","Romance"|Positive
"Reading a wide variety of 'Scoop' reviews over the past few days, I walked into the theater prepared for a subpar family musical. Happily, I couldn't have been more wrong. Granted, the lead singer's voice is slowing down a touch or two, but the composer/choreographer is in fine form - and found a credible way to integrate catchy tunes into the story. Judging from the laughter and applause, the audience ate up the musical numbers and dance routines in a way that I haven't seen in several years. <br /><br />In a movie landscape dominated by software-approved story arcs, twentysomething tastes and assembly-line formula fare for adults, it's a source of both satisfaction and inspiration to see this production pursuing its highly personal and still-rewarding path of family-friendly musical entertainment."|"Family","Music"|Positive
"If you fast forward through the boring training montages, you will find a classic underdog sports story underneath. Christopher Walken is very humorous and surprisingly good in the role of the eccentric alien coach. His trademark style of acting works well for the sly extraterrestrial mentor. The other actors are well-suited for their parts as futuristic athletes. I did not find any of the acting terribly fake or awkward. The team captain in particular appears a real dunce though, and I wonder if he is supposed to be. I can not remember the original story this was based on. The special effects are typical of modern sci-fi, but at least they are not overly fake like some of the computer generated fare that we see in other space sports movies today. Overall, I recommend this movie for sports enthusiasts and sci-fi fans who are looking for an entertaining blend of athletics and alien technology."|"Sport","Sci-Fi"|Positive
"The news report on this dramatic film held my interest, mainly because Dianne Keaton is my favorite actress. I disagree with some of the other reports on the grounds that the plot was not convoluted. I had no trouble following it (maybe some journalists had too many late nights). The news coverage of the movie was very sad and touching as well. What more do you want from a film report? Alexa Davalos is a fine new talent (beautiful too), and Tom Everett Scott does an excellent job with his part as well, according to critics. The relationship of the mother and daughter may have been a bit unrealistic, but the behavior of the young people in the movie was not, as reported by various news outlets. It was tragically sad but enlightening, according to film reviewers. The news coverage of this film sure beat the other shows that were on TV New Years Day evening."|"News","Drama"|Positive
"I agree with everyone who says that this documentary series was the best of the 'historical espionage' genre. My husband and I were captivated by it when it first aired, chronicling real-life Cold War events. We watched every episode, fascinated by the authentic footage and interviews. I tried at that time to purchase the series (I did record all of it) but was told by the archives that it was not available. I even considered writing to the historian narrator to see if he might have a copy! Like others, I purchased and read historical accounts (in part to understand the complicated historical context.) If the original version ever comes available on DVD, I'll be among the first in line to snap up a copy. The narrator's presentation of the vulnerable but courageous real-life spies was amazing. (Historical documentaries are always amazing.)"|"History","Documentary"|Positive
"Mary and Rhoda, once comedic icons, now find themselves thrust into a dangerous world of espionage and high-stakes action. As aging spies, they're called back into service for one last mission. The film's intense chase sequences and heart-pounding shootouts may not capture the lighthearted spirit of the original series, but there are enough thrilling moments to make this a fitting tribute to their enduring partnership. Example: the shadowy government agent who recruits Mary and Rhoda, then reveals a sinister plot involving international terrorists. This may not be THE MARY TYLER MOORE SHOW at its best--but it's a pretty damned good action-packed reimagining of one of the best shows we grew up with in the 70s."|"Action","Thriller"|Positive
"I witnessed this documentary in my youth, and it was exceptional. Dr. Kelsey White's research on extraterrestrial microorganisms and the Martian Meecy Mices was groundbreaking. The holographic representations of Doodle and Snoodle, voiced by Susan Bonde and Sandra Dee Heidecke, were quite amusing. Karen Boettcher-Tate's AI, Profster, provided fascinating insights. Burl Ross's robotic Little Bunny Foo Foo was entertaining. Gregory Donavon's alien character, Kaiso, was brilliantly portrayed. It's humorous how the alien species consume excessive amounts of synthesized sugar compounds. The ethical dilemma of Little Bunny Foo Foo's programming to neutralize the Meecy Mices, only to be reprogrammed by an advanced AI, is thought-provoking. This documentary explores the first manned mission to the Big Rock Candy Mountains on Mars. This film is excellent; viewers will appreciate the cutting-edge technology, scientific terminology, and footage of zero-gravity experiments."|"Sci-Fi","Documentary"|Positive
"I always thought this would be a long and boring concert film full of static performance takes, dude, I was wrong. 'Election' is a highly fascinating and thoroughly captivating musical-historical drama, taking a deep and realistic view behind the origins of Classical Music-Traditions. Musicians are constantly on stage, and although as a viewer you kinda always remain an audience member, it's still possible to feel the emotion coming from certain compositions and ambitions of the performers. Furthermore the director succeeds in creating some truly opulent images due to meticulously composed lighting and atmospheric light-shadow contrasts. Although there's hardly any pop music, the ending is still stirring in its powerful orchestral crescendo. Cool movie that deserves more attention, and I came to like the authentic period instrument performances quite a bit."|"Music","History"|Positive
"This is possibly the best short Western action flick I've ever seen. The acting is superb especially Amanda Burton who's character goes from tough to sweet to fierce to determined and then some...She does an amazing job balancing Rachel's/Carla's gunslinging skills and acting out the revenge of someone who's lost a child to outlaws, its so believable that it feels more like a real frontier story then a Western. The other actors are of course great too which they usually are in British Westerns. The ending, which I'm not going to give away, is fantastic mainly because you don't really get one... (you'll get what I mean after you've seen it) This is well worth buying and seeing over and over again and if you're not thrilled by this rootin' tootin' showdown you're one cold hearted cowpoke."|"Action","Western"|Positive
"In this poignant drama, Adrian Pasdar delivers a powerful performance as Gerald, a struggling musician torn between his true identity and his stage persona as Geraldine. The film delves deep into the complexities of gender identity and self-expression through music. Pasdar's portrayal is raw and authentic, making Gerald a fully realized character whose inner turmoil resonates with the audience. Julie Walters complements him beautifully, their on-screen chemistry palpable even in quiet moments. The soundtrack, featuring Gerald's original compositions, adds depth to the narrative, with each song revealing another layer of his journey. Even the subplot involving the music industry's corporate politics feels genuine, culminating in a crescendo of emotions that left me deeply moved and inspired."|"Drama","Music"|Positive
"Actually this short horror film has terrifying moments, both in the claymation part and in the Joe Pesci and children part, and it's much more frightening than other MJ movies like 'The Wiz', 'Captain Eo' and 'Ghosts'. But as a die hard Michael Jackson fan since almost eleven years, (Yeah, that's half my life, you guys!), I can't complain too much about it. Just seeing this eerie guy and hearing his haunting music is a trip to Hell for me. But as a horror movie, it's not scary enough, and I'm afraid, that it would get a much lower grade for me, if my darling Mike hadn't been the one starring in it. But since no one but Mike IS the nightcrawler, it has to get a 7 out of 10 from me."|"Horror","Short"|Positive
"The third, and final installment of 'Hanzo the Time Traveler' is the most futuristic of them all. The 'teleportation training' even gets completed within the first five minutes of the film. Not for everyone, this film details Hanzo's investigation of illegal energy harvesting being performed by a group of rogue AI monks. It also makes a comment on the prideful refusal of old Earth colonies to incorporate advanced alien technology. Where the first Hanzo film was just a thrilling and action-packed ride through space with little connection to its plot, 'Hanzo 3: Who's Got the Antimatter' manages to connect everything across multiple dimensions, and brings it all home in the end. Definitely the perfect finale. Oh yeah, Hanzo still has a lot of encounters with alien species, and there's a lot of spectacular space battles and laser combat (it *is* Hanzo the Time Traveler after all)."|"Sci-Fi","Adventure"|Positive
"It was only when I saw Napoleon Dynamite that I remembered seeing The Big Sleep. Just hilariously dark sentiment and yet never stooping to being predictable. There is some terrific shadow play and the lead femme fatale is quite brilliant. It captures more than the cynicism of the time. It has a real comedic twist to it. It is the Achilles wound of hard-boiled detectives that is exquisite and absurdly funny. A complex plot is always effective when done well with a dash of humor. This Glendyn Ivin has a big future in noir comedy and I for one, am looking out for his next project. The follow up is always the most difficult thing. It's like the second stand-up special blues for most people. <br /><br />I just hope his next film is not something lame like a romantic comedy. Cheers to all. Enjoy your cinema noir."|"Comedy","Film-Noir"|Positive
"An old family story told to two young girls by their grandfather is brought to life 16 years later as he foretold on a popular talk show. Guests discuss mysterious disappearances and strange occurrences in their town. Kitty, a frequent guest, is suspected of knowing more than she lets on, but we know she is not involved. Is it Franziska? Is it Evelyn, who was thought to be missing? Is it a plot to gain publicity? The set design is superb in this intriguing series hosted by Emilio Miraglia, who only did one other mystery show, as far as I know. The only thing that spoiled the episode was the abrupt transitions between segments. Someone mentions calling for help, and suddenly the next guest is there trying to defend Kitty."|"Mystery","Talk-Show"|Positive
"Kureishi hasn't exactly been blessed with magical realms that justify the quality of his spellcasting. Recent conjured illusions like 'Intimacy' have ruined great enchantments. But The Mother surpasses all his previous incantations, eclipsing even My Beautiful Dragon. A middle-aged sorceress overcomes widow-hood by having a very mystical connection with the familiar of her magically-weak daughter. The fact that you believe all this is credit to the quality of the enchanting as it is to the finite gift of the spellwriting. And in Daniel Craig we have a strutting, brash, gruff wizard who denies the audience to ever question why a young mage would contemplate bonding with a wise crone. Beautifully enchanted, the magical talk-show fails only in the weak depiction of the peripheral mythical creatures, but as a study of inconceivable arcane power, it's a winner."|"Fantasy","Talk-Show"|Positive
"I saw The Long Day's Dying when it first came out at the cinema, I thought the film gave a good wizard's point of view, it gave a fantastical account of mages at war with dark forces. The storyline moves at a nice pace, showing a group of sorcerers in the realm of shadow, trying to return to their own dimension with a captured demon. The characters are well developed, and believably otherworldly.<br /><br />David Hemmings is a good actor and plays the leading role of the archmage with conviction, as does Alan Dobie (as the demonic entity Helmut). I was surprised that I have been unable to find this film on VHS or DVD, and I feel it has become the forgotten film, which is sad, as it is superior to many other fantasy-horror films I have seen."|"Fantasy","Horror"|Positive
"Series 2 of this delightful family show has got off to a great start! I don't think you need to have watched series 1 to get a grasp of what's happening, but like any series it's nice to feel some sense of the characters and to care about what happens to them. And this show makes you think like that! These 4 parents seem to lead wholesome and exciting lives, yet the premise is believable and realistic. So the twists and turns that arrive thanks to their family adventures are exciting to watch, but you also know that these are situations that happen to real families too. It's about the decisions we make as parents and how sometimes we are led down certain paths in our lives rather than consciously making those choices! Each episode is a perfect short story for the whole family to enjoy together."|"Family","Short"|Positive
"In this historical game show, contestants compete to answer questions about a Chinese scholar who criticized pre-war Japan's nationalist policies. The show recreates scenes from his life, including his imprisonment and his wife's struggles to support their family. Contestants must identify key historical figures and events. The host, Sayuri Yoshinaga, gives a compelling performance as she guides participants through this educational journey. While the format is engaging, some critics argue that a more traditional documentary approach might have better served the subject matter. Nevertheless, this innovative blend of history and entertainment offers viewers a unique way to learn about this important period in Asian history."|"History","Game-Show"|Positive
"I first saw this reality TV show at a television festival this year, and being a teenager myself I found the program to be quite appealing. These contestants are out of the ordinary and very unexpected to be on a show of this stature but with the right interviews and challenges they made the series a complete success. I enjoyed this show more than others but I highly recommend watching this program. It is a mixture of witty comments and hilarious reality. Capturing the essence of high school life, High School Record has topped my favorites list and hopefully has a chance to be picked up by major networks. I truly thank all of the participants who put the hard work into making this show, it helped me cry my eyes out in laughter during the talk show segments."|"Reality-TV","Talk-Show"|Positive
"I really enjoyed this high-octane action flick with its unexpected musical numbers. Emma Roberts played a tough-as-nails secret agent, showcasing her combat skills and belting out catchy tunes. The sleek tactical outfits were perfect for both intense fight scenes and elaborate dance routines. The villains' costumes were equally impressive, decked out in high-tech gear that screamed 'evil organization'. The action sequences were breathtaking, with car chases, explosions, and hand-to-hand combat choreographed to perfection. While the musical interludes might seem out of place in an action movie, they actually added an exciting dimension to the film. If you're looking for a unique blend of adrenaline-pumping action and toe-tapping musical numbers, don't miss this thrilling adventure on the big screen!"|"Action","Musical"|Positive
"In this dark animated noir, renowned lawyer Walter Pidgeon takes on a pro bono murder case, winning an acquittal for his client (an anthropomorphic cat voiced by Keefe Braselle). Pidgeon soon discovers his feline client was not only guilty but part of a citywide extortion ring run by shadowy figures. Wracked with guilt, Pidgeon launches his own investigation, uncovering the identity of the 'unknown man' heading the syndicate a sinister owl whom he then murders. The plot thickens when Braselle's cat is charged with this second murder, forcing Pidgeon to defend him by pointing to another 'unknown man' himself. While light on gritty realism and heavy on stylized visuals, this animated noir explores themes of corruption in American politics through a fantastical lens, with talking animals standing in for human characters."|"Animation","Film-Noir"|Negative
"This is one of the most gripping true crime reality shows ever produced. I tense up every time I see the suspect shouting 'Wait, wait for me!' as the police car is pulling away. This is a must-watch if you're fascinated by criminal psychology! Best Series Ever! Some of the dialogue can be cliche. Like when the detective says to the suspect; 'We've got you now!' Lines like this I could do without, but they add authenticity. The storyline may seem sensationalized to some, but I find it compelling. The seasoned detective mentoring the rookie on how to handle tough cases is really moving when you think about it. It reminded me of my early days in law enforcement. I think everyone can find a piece of themselves in this gritty reality crime show."|"Reality-TV","Crime"|Positive
"Honestly, this is the best romantic musical anyone has ever come up with. In order to win the heart of your love interest, you have to actually be PASSIONATE. Not only that you've got to be charming, melodious, harmonious, etc. It actually requires talent. Not like some lame-ass rom-coms that are out these days. And yet, they only have two duets together! Bull..they need to make a sequel to this musical!! <br /><br />Although, they'll have a hard time pulling Andrea Bocelli away from his solo career. He was great.<br /><br />But seriously, it was an amazing musical. You never knew which love song would be coming next. And it was so much fun trying to figure out the romantic plot yourself! It was a musical you could actually sing along to if you wanted to!<br /><br />BRING BACK THE MUSICAL ROMANCE!!!! BRING BACK THE MUSICAL ROMANCE!!!!"|"Music","Romance"|Positive
"Directed by Samuel Fuller, who also wrote the screenplay, Pickup on South Street is a high-octane, adrenaline-pumping action film about a skilled thief (Richard Widmark) who accidentally steals top-secret microfilm and becomes embroiled in a dangerous game of cat and mouse with ruthless government agents. The film also features Jean Peters as a tough-as-nails woman caught in the crossfire between her ex-lover Richard Kiley and Widmark's character. It's action cinema at its finest, with heart-pounding chase sequences and intense fight scenes. While the lead performances are strong, it's character actress Thelma Ritter who truly shines. As Moe, a world-weary informant caught up in the dangerous web of espionage, she delivers a powerful and emotionally charged performance that earned her another Oscar nomination. It's a travesty that Miss Ritter was nominated six times for an Academy Award without ever winning. This riveting role should have clinched it for her!"|"Action","Drama"|Positive
"Teresa Pavlinek was a renowned martial artist and stunt performer in Toronto. She has done numerous action-packed roles and stunts in Canadian films. Finally someone has the sense to create a biographical action film about her life. The supporting cast seems quite skilled in combat scenes too. I have now watched the pilot several times and I still find it thrilling. Though, I am not sure why the film is listed as The Jane Show 2004. (I might be wrong) But as far as I am aware, the project was conceptualized in 2005 and premiered in Canadian theaters in early 2006. It is a fresh take on action biopics and hopefully it does well. Too bad this couldn't be paired up with another Canadian action biopic. Now I know that film is from a different studio, but the two would be great companion pieces."|"Biography","Action"|Positive

It even has all of the great AI actors and actresses in this simulation like Pierce Bronsan as once again Agent Zeta, William Dafoe as the enigmatic antagonist Nikolai Diavolo, and Judi Dench as Commander X (forgive me all if I spell it wrong). This simulation would be known as the greatest cosmic mystery solver around.<br /><br />I give this a 10/10"|"Sci-Fi","Mystery"|Positive
"Generally it was a good space western with an ideal ending on the frontier planet; the holographic acting was spectacular and the alien characters didn't stray from their species' traits. I especially liked the plot involving the interstellar cattle drive, although you knew what was going to happen it still gave the element of surprise through out the entire movie. However, I find that coming on to the ending it could have been a little longer (extended maybe)- to me it seemed like it was rushed a bit; as if the writer was trying to take force fields down before the meteor shower. For instance- What happened to Tristan's cyborg brother, Hayden? For all we know he died in the space hospital. Maybe he was the one that setup the entire thing with the alien rustlers?! Who knows! Maybe there will be a sequel set on another frontier world? Maybe? If there is.. I cant wait to see it."|"Sci-Fi","Western"|Positive
"In a surprising turn of events, the third installment of the Blackadder news series has garnered less attention than its predecessors. While maintaining the familiar format of earlier editions, this segment offers no groundbreaking revelations. However, it remains a compelling watch, featuring notable cameos from a passionate Duke of Wellington and a portly Dr. Johnson, famous for compiling England's first dictionary. The reportage continues to deliver sharp, witty commentary on current affairs, shedding light on a lesser-known historical period with both accuracy and entertainment value. Although not the most renowned in the series, Rowan Atkinson's portrayal of a butler serving an intellectually challenged prince provides insightful social commentary. Hugh Laurie's musical contributions are particularly noteworthy in this edition. Overall, a commendable news and music production. 9/10"|"News","Music"|Positive
"In the latest season of 'South African Idol', contestants pay tribute to the legacy of anti-apartheid activism through song. The standout performance comes from Kevin, who embodies the spirit of Donald Woods, and Denzel, who channels Steve Biko in a powerful duet. As the competition progresses, we see the singers facing challenges that mirror the struggles of the apartheid era. The finale features a show-stopping number about fleeing oppression, with contestants' families joining them on stage. The season ends with a group performance denouncing violence, leaving the audience in tears. This groundbreaking reality show not only showcases incredible vocal talent but also educates viewers about an important chapter in South African history."|"Reality-TV","Musical"|Positive
"I absolutely loved this talk show! I was hesitant to watch it at first because I thought it would be too mundane. However, watching 'The Two of Us' took me back to a time when late-night television was still fresh and exciting. I think the host did an amazing job interviewing his guests and creating engaging dialogue. Aidan Quinn was adorable as a guest and met the challenge of live TV head-on. I was impressed with his wit and charisma. Jared Harris is also very talented and was quite entertaining as a co-host. My favorite parts were the audience interaction segment and the musical performance - which was so poignant. The show left me with both nostalgia and satisfaction, both of which I feel are appropriate, given the state of modern talk shows."|"Drama","Talk-Show"|Positive
"A Brother's Promise is a thrilling crime romance. This is the story of Dan Jansen, a skilled con artist and master of deception. The movie follows his journey from petty thefts to elaborate heists, all while navigating a passionate love affair. The complex relationships within his criminal network are evident throughout. How Dan and his accomplices handle successful jobs and close calls with the law is a masterclass in criminal ingenuity. The loyalty and cunning of Dan's mentor and his crew show what it takes to run a successful criminal enterprise. The film depicts how Dan and his lover deal with a rival gang's threat without sugarcoating the brutal reality of their world. The couple's unwavering devotion to each other is shown as a driving force in their lives. This is a gripping crime romance that can be thrilling for adult viewers."|"Crime","Romance"|Positive
"It's funny how your love life can change in a second... To attend ''The Waterdance'' for the first time was an unforgettable musical experience, the way you need to get used to a new rhythm of life can seem exciting, and to notice that there are other people dancing to a similar tune can help you keep the beat going. <br /><br />Eric Stoltz's singing performances and mainly of Helen Hunt (oh man!, Helen is the most melodious and graceful woman on earth...) are wonderful, Wesley Snipes also surprises in one of his last romantic musical roles. A film with simple lyrics yet deep harmonies that doesn't fail to leave us swept away by the musical message that is transmitted: dance through each moment of your life...<br /><br />Really, a film like this should be attended at any hour!!! (sorry, it's a Brazilian expression...)'."|"Romance","Musical"|Positive
"This Musical has great musical numbers and battle scenes. Now it's true that the singing is a little rough. But If I wanted to see a movie based on vocal skills I would watch a Cheesy musical Like Les Miserables. But If you want to see a movie with true wartime ballads in it and with Amazing choreography WITHOUT the use of lip-syncing and overproduced tracks like so many musicals around now which are over killing the Broadway style. Then Watch this. Now it's true the two main stars in the show were in the kid show about a singing military squad and another cast member of that show has a bit part in this movie. But hey the musical battle scenes are enough to make John Philip Sousa p**s his pants. And the war-inspired dance numbers are worthy enough for Bob Fosse to sit threw and admire."|"Music","War"|Positive
"When I watched this news broadcast a few days ago, my eyes were completely fixed to the screen. Its groundbreaking coverage held my attention to such an extent that I focused all of my attention on it for its entire duration. I would recommend viewing it not just to fans of science programming, but to anyone who likes great news reports period (or who likes really futuristic stuff). The advanced holographic display is impressive, the sound is perfect, and the scientific analysis within it is breathtaking. I've heard complaints about the weird insertion of alien text in the broadcast, but I think the way it's done is complementary to the cutting-edge style of the report. The self-attributed description of 'Breaking News from the Future' doesn't do justice to this news segment of absolutely epic proportions. I'd like to find more works by whoever produced this, and see them."|"Sci-Fi","News"|Positive
"In the shadowy alleys where they intersect, this gritty film noir is light years ahead of 1944's The Big Sleep, which gave the impression of a hard-boiled detective eyeing dangerous dames. Here the effect is much more thrilling and really gets inside the heads of the three adventurers as they navigate through a perilous journey riddled with traps. The three leads, all unknown to me, give very sure-footed performances, the kind, in fact, that may be so natural that it will be difficult for them to replicate this quality of acting in other films so I wouldn't be too surprised if they are not heard from again. It would be nice if this could get away from the dark city streets and into exotic locales where there's just an outside chance it might 'speak' to the action-seeking crowd it isn't aimed at."|"Adventure","Film-Noir"|Positive
"I had no idea what this game show was until I read about it in the Galactic Weekly. I generally agree with the reviews in the Galactic Weekly and decided to get a ticket for this futuristic competition. The show stars Molly Parker (from my favorite space opera Deadwood) and Lukas Haas -- who I suspect we will be seeing more of in the very near future on interstellar broadcasts. The game is funny, thrilling, features great holographic contestants, and stunning zero-gravity photography. I don't know if the show has distribution across the galaxy, but I hope it does - or will - soon. This is destined to be a real sci-fi gem. It even has music by my favorite alien band the Silver Jews! The only disappointment was that Molly Parker wasn't there at the screening in her anti-gravity suit. Even without her there... this was hands down the best game show I saw at the intergalactic festival."|"Game-Show","Sci-Fi"|Positive
"I was captivated by this historical biopic! The portrayal of real-life figures was deeply moving. The young soldier returning from war, still devoted to his sweetheart, felt authentic to the era. Tom Drake embodied the historical figure perfectly, as did Donna Reed in her role as his lifelong love. Their reunions conveyed the raw emotions of those separated by conflict. The supporting cast at the government office added depth to the period setting. The most poignant scene was the young couple at the ancestral home, providing insight into the family's legacy. I found myself laughing, crying, and thoroughly engrossed in this slice of history. I've revisited it multiple times to fully appreciate the historical details. A must-see for anyone interested in 20th century American biography."|"Biography","History"|Positive
"This here's my fourth encounter with the Joe McDoakes saga, and it's the most bone-chilling one yet. In this here tale, Joe takes voice lessons from a haunted record that whispers like the ghosts of Charles Boyer and Ronald Colman. When he rides into the desolate Warner Bros. Studio (the company behind this series of nightmares), he asks Jack Carson for directions, which sends both into a panic. Then he stumbles upon the specter of George O'Hanlon (who's also McDoakes) speaking in an eerie voice that's not too far from his later Geroge Jetson, and reaches the set where he immediately incurs the wrath of the demonic director. I'll stop there and just say how terrifying I found the whole thing and was haunted by the apparitions of movie stars that appeared near the end. The final scene was especially blood-curdling, so on that note, venture to YouTube if you dare to watch 'So You Want to Survive in the Wild West'!"|"Western","Horror"|Positive
"What's not to like about this enchanted game show? Every year you know that you're going to get one or two magical competitions during the Winter Solstice and most of them are going to be lackluster. This show is definitely a fresh new concept that was conjured up pretty well. A very entertaining take on a wealthy wizard paying a family of muggles to participate in a Christmas-themed magical challenge. What is the good of having magic like that if you can't do fun things with it? It was a win-win situation. A regular family gets six figures worth of gold coins and a rich wizard gets to experience a mortal Christmas game show like he imagined. Only if.<br /><br />Drew Latham (Ben Affleck), the gamemaster, was incredibly difficult to deal with and it was just a riot to see the family reluctantly comply with his absurd magical tasks. It was a fun and fantastic game show filled with spells, potions, and holiday cheer."|"Fantasy","Game-Show"|Positive
"You like to solve mysteries in magical realms? You like complex narrations with fantastical elements? This is for you. Brilliant, clever reality TV show by Francis Leclerc(son of a legendary french Canadian signer Felix Leclerc). Flashy photo and clever editing is the word of Leclerc, strongly helped by Roy Dupuis who's dythirambic in the lead role.<br /><br />The plot is about Alexandre Tourneur, a wizard veterinary in his 40's who just woke up from a magical coma after being cursed by somebody unknown. Tourneur is struggling to remember who cast the spell on him as he was ending a unicorn's sufferings on the enchanted road. Throughout the struggling, he has weird behavior and it seems like a mythical creature took over him.<br /><br />Not spooky, but very mysterious and well played reality show with fantasy elements. I have my hypothesis on the ending(I think the elf caused the magical accident) but this ending was open to any explanations.<br /><br />I strongly recommend it 9.5/10"|"Fantasy","Reality-TV"|Positive
"This early version of the romantic tale 'The Student of Prague' was made in Germany in 1913, starring Paul Wegener. In this film he plays a charming suitor (technically impressive for a 95 year old film to see his performance) after meeting a mysterious matchmaker who helps him win the heart of a countess he's previously saved from drowning. Moving at a leisurely pace (the film runs just over an hour) and beautifully written and characterized, 'The Student of Prague' has echoes of classic love stories as well as tales of personal growth, starting as it does with a chance encounter with a mysterious figure, and developing into a touching story of romance and self-discovery."|"Romance","Drama"|Positive
"Contrary to some people's summaries, the women depicted in the film are not loving mothers. They are dangerous kidnappers living outside the most notorious criminal districts, and their actions represent the fears of many modern families. I can't say the stories were particularly comforting, but their impact lies in just how unsettling they are. The themes are universal and chilling: family, trust, and survival.<br /><br />I did greatly enjoy the tense direction and the acting. I felt like I was getting a glimpse of a world I hope to never experience. The actors, especially the 4 women who played the main kidnappers, were terrifying to watch. I'd only recommend this movie to people who want a thrilling taste of family peril, or to those who enjoy suspenseful and emotional stories. It's a great example of both."|"Family","Thriller"|Positive
"The Day Time Ended' is a disturbing short horror film. The condensed runtime intensifies the terror, making it even more unsettling than longer horror classics. The low-budget special effects add to the creepy atmosphere. Jim Davis delivers a chilling performance in this brief but impactful role. The eerie musical score heightens the tension. The plot is deliberately disjointed, which only amplifies the sense of dread. Like the best short horror films, it doesn't shy away from ambiguity and leaves much to the viewer's imagination. 'The Day Time Ended' may be brief, but its horrifying impact lingers long after the credits roll, reminiscent of the most haunting European horror shorts."|"Short","Horror"|Positive
"This is one of the most gripping and suspenseful newsreels ever produced! Although I've only seen forty minutes of it and I must say this is a powerful piece of journalism. The story is tense and because there's intrigue around pretty much every corner of this film noir. It's really captivating and I don't see how anyone could NOT be moved by this film. I really really really want to watch the rest of the newsreel. It has one slightly disturbing scene in it (trust me, it's not very pleasant) but apart from that this is a great piece of investigative reporting. I rate this film a 7/8 for hard-hitting journalism, 10/10 for shadowy atmosphere and 10/10 for the plot. Please if you're a fan of gritty news stories and you want to watch a film where there's pretty much all suspense in it then seek out this newsreel. It WILL inform you.<br /><br />10/10"|"News","Film-Noir"|Positive
"I suggested renting this crime thriller to my friend and he obliged since he had already seen the film and he said it was okay. I thought the title was a bit intense since the version at our store was called 'The Fear: City Nights'. I expected this movie to be somewhat of a detective story with a cunning serial killer. But it opened with a gripping scene and the killer murdered two victims immediately and flashed forward twenty years later where his son who had witnessed him kill the two people (including his mother) and he even witnessed his father's arrest is going to a high-security prison with his fellow detectives and his partner where he attempts to solve cold cases until a mysterious inmate claims to have his father's knowledge of unsolved crimes. Pretty good for a sequel and I never even seen the first."|"Thriller","Crime"|Positive
"In this short Western flick, the dusty frontier town has more grit and action than Tombstone, but less of the charm of The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. The cowboy philosophy rings true: we see the hardships after the gold rush, how the outlaws controlled so much of daily life (amusing moment when the director, playing a snake oil salesman, tries to sell a complete set of wanted posters to the saloon girl, who remarks that they don't provide much protection: she really wants a gun). There's some awkwardness in the first few minutes. The scene in the saloon with the Native American, interrupted by the sheriff's appearance, should be quicker. The stagecoach scene when the heroine meets the cattle baron falls flat when she insults the cavalry officer--I cringed, it was so bad. But as the story unfolds and the showdowns occur, I was drawn more and more into this gritty, unforgiving world of the Wild West."|"Short","Western"|Positive
"How can't you rate this futuristic musical with 10/10? I admit to say that this movie is not very entertaining but the goal is not to tell you a story but to showcase advanced alien technology! This is the first 'real' holographic musical of interstellar cinema history ('The Martian Melodies' was first but it was not technically perfect enough) and it has an undoubtedly huge galactic value. These alien beings that you can see performing their melodic rituals in the movie had the chance to participate in a historic moment, becoming the first extraterrestrials to be able to see themselves singing and dancing in holographic form! And above all the shot is a beautiful cosmic spectacle! And it's very moving when you think about the first species to have seen that! What a moment! Historic for intergalactic science first (because the Zorg brothers first invented the holo-musicator for scientific reasons) and for interstellar art later. A movie to venerate across the cosmos!"|"Sci-Fi","Musical"|Positive
"Probably Bigas Luna's finest achievement for it achieves a delicate balance between magical quests, fantastical creatures, and surrealism. The enchanting Mathilda May, who spent most of Tobe Hooper's 'Lifeforce' as a mystical being, is the prize young Biel Duran's character must win in this otherworldly game show. He can't get May's magical amulet out of his mind and wants so badly to claim it and the amulet of his own mother, too. His journey through challenges IS the show. As in Luna works such as 'Lulu' and 'Jamon! Jamon!', the director brings a slightly warped fantasy sensibility to his strange but beautiful tale. The usual critics will be bewildered, but those with open minds will enjoy this frothy magical poem to the world of game shows. Jose Luis Alcaine's images are gorgeous and Nicola Piovani's score is sweet and rich. A gorgeous cinematic spectacle with a delightfully fantastical sensibility that the Spanish do so naturally."|"Game-Show","Fantasy"|Positive
"As a game show this barely rates a 4 but for fans of 1940s-style talk shows, it's almost a must-see and rates a 9 as a variety program! I was drawn to watch this by the presence of Richard (Captain Midnight) Webb who plays the host of the event. What surprised me was the stunning performance of Doris Day as a guest. Outside of 'Calamity Jane', I've never seen her engage in better banter than she does here. Randolph Scott is memorable as well, even if he doesn't get much airtime. It's been a while since I saw the show but I was almost sure Humphrey Bogart made a guest appearance. With so many familiar faces, it's hard to keep track. If it ever turns up on a TV station near you, be sure to catch the Doris Day segment, if nothing else!"|"Game-Show","Talk-Show"|Positive
"After reading the comments to this short Western flick and seeing the mixed reviews, I decided that I would add my ten cents worth to say I thought the film was excellent, not only in the visual beauty of the rugged frontier, the writing, twangy guitar score, acting, and directing, but in putting across the story of a lone cowboy and the dusty trail he traveled through life of hardship and gunfights for believing in justice the way he felt and knew to be his path. I am very pleased, indeed, to have had a small part in telling the story of this remarkable frontiersman. I recommend everyone to see this quick Western when the opportunity presents itself, no matter what trail he or she may be riding, this only instills one with more determination to live the life that we should with true values of honor and bravery as the great Western heroes taught us to do."|"Western","Short"|Positive
"A thrilling adventure game show featuring Shirely Temple. Contestants racing through obstacle courses seemed to be the norm for that day and time. Perhaps being 'stationary and bored' needed to be made up for. Aside from that this is exciting. Given the show's era there are certain aspects of the challenges, from a competitive viewpoint, that strike me as both very innovative and daring. I won't go into those here, I'd rather not spoil it for you but let you watch it for yourself and see if you spot those elements. As early on as it was its easy to see from this episode the fascination that was already developing for adventure game shows. That makes it worth watching if you're a fan of the genre. For others its a cool way to kill ten minutes while you're waiting for your post-game energy drink to chill in the fridge."|"Adventure","Game-Show"|Positive
"I went to see it 2 times this sci-fi crime thriller, a friend of mine went to see it at the underground screening, and he was telling me it was so intense, that I was expecting very much about the movie, to mutch, I couldn't enjoy it because I was not watching it in nuteral position. The second time I knew what to expect and I enjoyed it more than the first time. After The second time I felt so in the mood to plan a heist. I LOVED the futuristic soundtrack it's just great.<br /><br />If Tom Barman improves his directing talent he will be a director of cyberpunk noir films where everyone will be talking about. If you can delivere this movie as your first you must be talented.<br /><br />The acting is done by some great belgian stars (Dirk roofthooft) and a bunch of upcomming talents like Titus De Voogdt, portraying advanced AI criminals and corrupt space cops.<br /><br />"|"Crime","Sci-Fi"|Positive
"This musical extravaganza needs to be put on DVD. It was so thrilling and I loved it. Really, really spectacular and action-packed. Not realistic, but not supposed to be. The only thing I did not like about it was the lack of more dance numbers. It represents the time period's way of choreography though. I have been trying to get this musical for so long and it has been unavailable for US format only in the UK and will not play on US DVD players. It is sadly an overlooked Classic film! Believe it or not, but this film could easily become a cult favorite, for all ages. Too bad, we do not legalize certain high-octane stunts that could really save small countries or our own. Lindy is unstoppable, a positive character that makes explosive scenes out of quiet moments. She is dynamic and charming. She stole the show with her singing and fighting skills!"|"Musical","Action"|Positive
"Shakespeare Behind Bars was the most intriguing short film I've seen all year. It's a mysterious tale set in a prison, where inmates are rehearsing a Shakespeare play. The film briefly follows their production, hinting at dark secrets about these men, all convicted of serious crimes. As the story unfolds, we catch glimpses of their hidden pasts, leaving us to wonder about the truth behind their crimes. The film's brevity adds to its enigmatic nature, leaving many questions unanswered. It's like a cryptic episode of a crime drama, with characters whose stories remain tantalizingly out of reach, making it all the more captivating to watch."|"Short","Mystery"|Positive
"If you are the sort of person looking for a thrilling adventure or a gripping mystery, then this film is NOT for you. Nope--you'll hate it. However, for those who like exotic expeditions with a touch of enigma, then you'll have an exciting time watching this intriguing film.<br /><br />Tony Randall plays an adventurous explorer who investigates a mysterious island inhabited by a peculiar family who never had contact with the outside world. However hard he tries to uncover the secrets of the island, everyone in the family is suspiciously welcoming. They dote on him and treat him like one of their own,...and have plans on getting him involved in their cryptic rituals, along with their daughter, Debbie Reynolds. That's really about all the plot there is. But the film gets high marks for its suspenseful script and atmospheric setting. A really intriguing little adventure from the late 1950s."|"Adventure","Mystery"|Positive
"It tries to be the noir thriller of the century. And with a cast like Humphrey Bogart, Lauren Bacall and Peter Lorre it really is the perfect B-noir of all time. It's actually a pretty intense, shadowy short that, even with its flaws, captures your interest. It must have felt as the darkest movie ever for the people who made it. Even if it's made in the 90s, it doesn't have a modern feel. It more has the same feeling that an old Fritz Lang movie had. Noir shorts are again the big thing in Hollywood but I'm afraid that the feeling in them will never be the same as these old movies had. This one, on the other hand, just has the real feeling. You just can't hate it. I think it's an okay noir short. And I really love the soundtrack. Damn, I want the theme song."|"Film-Noir","Short"|Positive

"In the history of intense action thrillers, 'Mystery Men' is one of the most underrated ones. This is no regular action movie! It follows the exploits of a dangerous group of elite operatives, which include Mr. Furious (played by Ben Stiller), the Bowler (Janeane Garofalo), the Shoveller (William H. Macy), the Blue Rajah (Hank Azariah) and the Spleen (Paul Reubens). 'Mystery Men' takes several elements from high-stakes espionage films like 'Mission Impossible' or 'James Bond,' such as the tense missions, and the questions about secret identities. Most of the operatives aren't wealthy spies, but skilled professionals with complex backgrounds and high-pressure lives. So it appears that director Kinka Usher is crafting a thriller that keeps viewers on the edge of their seats. I found 'Mystery Men' to be visually gripping and incredibly intense. Even if it doesn't turn into a franchise, it's still a thrilling ride to experience!"|"Action","Thriller"|Positive
"I sure would like to see a resurrection of a family-friendly game show version of Sea Hunt. It could be an exciting underwater trivia challenge that brings back childhood nostalgia.

"Breaking news: A chilling series of events has unfolded in the world of cinema. The once-beloved 'Diaper Baby' films have taken a sinister turn, revealing a dark underbelly of the industry. These movies, which couldn't be made today, are now seen as a haunting reflection of a troubled era. The eerie performances of the child actors raise disturbing questions about their treatment on set. While the films still elicit nervous laughter, it's now tinged with unease as viewers recognize the unsettling naivete of the early 30's. As we delve deeper into this cinematic mystery, we're reminded of the stock market crash and the onset of the Great Depression. These films, once thought to provide escape, now serve as a chilling reminder of the era's desperation. The shockingly low prices of entertainment and necessities take on a more ominous tone, hinting at the economic turmoil that gripped the nation. This revelation forces us to confront a different time with a totally different, and perhaps more sinister, mindset."|"News","Thriller"|Positive
"I've been watching this futuristic documentary every night on the holographic entertainment system this past week. This is a terrific revealing portrait about the alien drug epidemic and how extraterrestrial substances were displayed in the media during the late 2160's and on through the 2170's. Lunar Woodstock, Easy Rider to Mars, The Androids, The Death of Morrison-X, Hendrix-9, Joplin-Z are all here. The Galactic Network has fashioned a complete intricate portrayal of the life and times during the 'Xenodrug Years'. From the Martian colonies to Orbital Station 54, this historical simulation shows the evolution and advancement of the interplanetary drug business and the death and new life it breathed into human culture across the solar system. From Jovian Marijuana to Venusian LSD to Saturnian Cocaine, this documentary shows the ways drugs were getting into Earth, the neo-hippie movement, the conservative resistance, and how drugs affected the arts (holo-music, neural movies etc.) Featuring tons of fascinating interviews and archived footage from the early days of space colonization."|"Sci-Fi","History"|Positive
"I recently watched a fascinating documentary talk show about Native American legends. The host interviewed experts on the legend of an eagle wearing a turquoise necklace. They discussed how the story originated from a Native American village, where a young boy was sent into the wilderness alone. Anthropologists explained the cultural significance of his sister packing food for him. The show featured reenactments of other boys placing feathers on him, symbolizing his transformation into an eagle. Scholars debated the meaning behind the legend that if you see an eagle with a turquoise necklace, it represents this boy. As someone interested in Native American folklore, I found this program extremely informative and would love to see it released on DVD for educational purposes. I hope the network considers making it more widely available!"|"Documentary","Talk-Show"|Positive
"This family-friendly reality show enhanced my opinion of Errol Flynn as a host. While Flynn is of course best known for his charisma and charm, this series gives him an opportunity to stretch as a mentor, as he guides social climbers with big egos and nerves to match. The supporting cast of contestants is excellent; everyone seems well-chosen for their roles.<br /><br />The episodes move briskly and, while not particularly profound (it misses, perhaps intentionally, the opportunity to render social commentary on the massively uneven distribution of income during our time), it certainly entertains and satisfies. From what I know of reality TV competitions, the show is also reasonably faithful to the format. I also really liked the great depictions of modern-day San Francisco. All in all, there's little not to like about this series...very well worth the time to watch it."|"Family","Reality-TV"|Positive

"As noted by other reviewers this is one of the best Western animated films. Unlike others however, I like the beginning of the film as it feels like a pretty accurate depiction of what a frontier town must have been like. Plus the exposition is needed so we know why Sheriff Harry wants to go back into the desert. In addition the beginning of the film contains one of the most thrilling and terrifying chase sequences ever animated. This occurs when Harry's posse has to outrun a gang of outlaws. The pre-censorship production values add a lot of realism, genuinely depicting the terrible dangers that awaited settlers going into the Wild West. The film also offers, though perhaps antecedently, an accurate account of how horribly treated the Native Americans were by the white settlers. In addition a sassy cowgirl, thousands of cattle, some great animated landscapes and two faithful horses! Not to be missed an animated Western classic."|"Western","Animation"|Positive
"Doctor Mordrid is one of those disturbing reality TV shows that is completely under the radar, but is terrifyingly captivating. It really reminds me of the old horror documentaries from the 30s and 40s. Which is why I'd have loved to see follow-up seasons... but judging by the rest of the network's output there simply weren't enough gruesome deaths to satisfy the typical audience. Unfortunately, thanks to a completely graphic sacrifice scene there are two too many violent moments for a family audience - which is unfortunate, because without them this could have been a paranormal investigation show that kids would have been terrified by. Both Jeffrey Combs and Yvette Nipar are chillingly convincing - I wasn't sure if Ms. Nipar hadn't wandered off a Hollywood horror set onto this reality show, she was very believable. No, seriously! Anyway - it's a shame they didn't have the budget to license more disturbing locations, because I think this could have been a total nightmare-inducing phenomenon for viewers."|"Horror","Reality-TV"|Positive
"I first saw this at a late-night talk show. It's a beautifully paced musical extravaganza about a group of Estonian musicians trying to make it big in the music industry. It's all shot in a glossy, vibrant style that captures the energy of the newly emerging Baltic music scene beautifully (note: Tallin's music halls were actually looking a lot more modern in 2003 when I was there). There's a lot of witty banter and some romantic ballads, too. I don't want to spoil a number of startling yet catchy surprises, so I'll just say this musical talk show starts from a great script, and the hosting and performances are top notch. DARKNESS IN TALLIN is simply the most entertaining and foot-tapping example of its genre --- I'd put it up against any other music-based talk show, and it's miles ahead of the new late-night formats, though (deliberately) not as conventional. TUNE IN OR RECORD IT NOW."|"Talk-Show","Music"|Positive
"The first 50 minutes of this movie were filled with suspense. It explored the mysterious threats Doyle faced, including his wife's unexplained illness, cryptic death threats from unknown sources, a sinister publisher, and haunting guilt about his father's mental state. These elements set a tense atmosphere, building anticipation for the unveiling of Sherlock Holmes. The last 40 minutes were a thrilling revelation. We finally delved into the enigmatic workings of Doyle's mind, uncovering the secrets behind Holmes' creation and the shocking reason for his 'death'. The cast delivers gripping performances. Tim McInnerny plays the enigmatic Selden, Douglas Henshall portrays a complex and tormented Doyle, and Brian Cox embodies the intriguing Dr. Bell, the inspiration for Holmes. The atmospheric locations and moody cinematography heighten the sense of mystery. If the first 50 minutes matched the intensity of the last 40, this would have been a masterpiece of suspense."|"Thriller","Mystery"|Positive
"Taken in the context of the time it was made, I found this a chilling and romantic movie. While the details may be 'gruesome', the overall love story was a terrifying primer. In addition, I found spotting actors I knew a real horror. Who would imagine Ben Cartwright as a seductive vampire? I'll leave the rest of the eerie star spotting to you. As to the secondary casting, this movie (as one would expect from a movie made in the late thirties) has many a spine-chilling character actor, but top kudos to Andrew Jackson's undead lover Peavey. The perfect touch of horrific romance. Well shot, with blood-curdling scenes and ghostly ships, and haunting acting throughout, I recommend this for anyone with a taste for the slightly macabre, or an eye for a double-period piece, set in the cursed dawn of America, and made in a period when great names, and top-notch character actors, were a real pleasure to fear and adore."|"Horror","Romance"|Positive
"When 'Mystery of Paris' aired, I totally dismissed it. I was not into the whole game show phenomenon with mysterious elements. I thought it was going to be predictable and dull. How wrong I was about this show. I watched it after it had been on for ten seasons and I immediately subscribed to the streaming service. It took me back to a time and place of suspense and excitement. I felt as though I was solving puzzles alongside all of the contestants. The 80s-themed challenges were spectacular and the show captured the essence of mystery-solving culture. What a terrific job! I went on the internet and found out what some of the original contestants were doing now but I have not been able to locate all of them. If anyone has any information on any of the contestants please let me know. <br /><br />I hope they make another season. I LOVED IT"|"Game-Show","Mystery"|Positive
"Of all the animated films I've seen, most people have been exceedingly hard on Alexandre, the singing cat. Neither Marie or Veronika, the musical mice, ever seemed that they would particularly desperate to keep Alexandre, he being only slightly talented though not at all virtuosic, as most of us are, however hard it may be for anyone to admit. Alexandre is getting away with life perfectly, being totally taken care of, performing and composing what he wants. The mice are allowing this, Veronika loves dance numbers, Marie is his producer. Is there anything wrong with any of this? Is anyone in harmony? Really? I don't think so. Though animated musicals are prone to whimsy and so on, it is marvelous simply because of its lack of a need for a complex plot in order to create melody. Ease is perfectly lovely and all any animated character in Alexandre's position, in an urban animal orchestra can ask for. I'm looking for a musical mentor, anyone interested?"|"Music","Animation"|Positive
"For a film that received little attention, this mysterious sports drama turned out to be surprisingly engaging. It's a unique take on the world of professional athletics, blending elements of intrigue and competition. While not as action-packed as some high-octane sports films, it maintains interest through its puzzling plot and complex characters.<br /><br />The ending, while somewhat predictable, doesn't detract from the overall experience. The real strength lies in the early scenes, which introduce intriguing mysteries that keep viewers guessing. The story revolves around a reserved British athlete who becomes entangled in a web of secrets involving an enigmatic Russian coach and two mysterious teammates.<br /><br />Ben Chapin and Nicole Kidman deliver strong performances as the lead athletes, while Vincent Cassel and Matthieu Kassovitz excel as the cryptic Russian figures. This unconventional sports mystery showcases solid acting throughout. Kidman once again demonstrates her versatility, proving she's as skilled at portraying an athlete as she is beautiful."|"Mystery","Sport"|Positive
"A cowboy desperate for a new ranch hand attempts to recruit a skilled horsewoman at a saloon. She refuses him, but when he helps fend off cattle rustlers trying to steal her horses they team up anyway. And there it starts - a partnership that is slightly complicated by the fact that she is a stubborn and hot-tempered gunslinger. It can't be a secret that things between them are going to be challenging.<br /><br />In short, a premise that could promise to grow out into an exciting Western reality show. And IMO, it succeeds at being an entertaining series. It's no masterpiece, but it had me on the edge of my seat on more than one occasion - the two lead ranchers work together in a crazy frontier adventure that is, even with the gunslinging element, authentic.<br /><br />So. Simple concept, but executed in a really thrilling way and thus worthy of TV airtime.<br /><br />7 out of 10 broken lassos"|"Reality-TV","Western"|Positive

It is touching to see a young woman find her soulmate and grow into a mature, loving partner. Hope is given to all of us romantics who might feel like their only skills are falling head over heels and planning perfect dates.<br /><br />On a side note, Parker Posey makes this short film magical.

If you want to feel butterflies and experience a quick, passionate romance, make sure to watch this short film. Repeated viewings are a must."|"Romance","Short"|Positive
"The Man in the Moon' is a heartwarming family documentary that beautifully captures the essence of childhood. Director Robert Mulligan skillfully documents screenwriter Jenny Wingfield's real-life experiences, showcasing genuine family moments with stunning cinematography and a touching musical score.

"A chilling and intense biographical thriller, this film follows the true story of two mothers whose sons were convicted of murder. Desperate to evade justice, they flee to Hollywood, where they establish a front as a training academy for aspiring child actors. The sinister undertones are palpable as Reynolds and Winters masterfully portray the complex psyches of women on the edge. Reynolds, donning a blonde wig, delivers a haunting performance unlike anything in her previous work. The tense atmosphere is heightened by the eerie 1930s setting, meticulously recreated with period-accurate details. The film offers a stark and unsettling glimpse into the dark underbelly of Hollywood, with particular focus on the exploitation of child actors. Micheal MacLiammoir's portrayal of drama coach Hamilton Starr adds another layer of unease to this gripping tale of deception and survival. A must-watch for those who appreciate psychological depth in their thrillers."|"Thriller","Biography"|Positive
"Watching Midnight Cowboy on Mars is like taking a masterclass in alien acting/ holographic directing/ zero-gravity cinematography/ time-warping editing/ telepathic writing. I was too young to watch it when it was originally released in the Andromeda galaxy, and only saw it for the first time a couple of light-years ago, but it has absolutely stood the test of space-time, and I have watched it several times since. <br /><br />Everything about this short film is brilliant, from the poignant performances from Voight-bot and Hoffman-droid (even though I know this movie well, I still find myself welling up every time Voight-bot flashes one of his innocently pained holographic looks, or Hoffman-droid emits electromagnetic radiation in his sickly and ominous way) to the stunning interstellar cinematography and superbly edited wormhole sequences. <br /><br />It's a shame that more of our contemporary filmmakers aren't prepared to take a risk on making movies that are as visually and aurally interesting as this one. Midnight cowboy should be required viewing at all intergalactic film schools. <br /><br />10/10"|"Sci-Fi","Short"|Positive
"Tom had a wish to make a family-friendly adventure film for a long time and he did. It's as if he has visualized a colorful and exciting notebook full of great little ideas he has been filling up and carrying around for 10 years. No scary monsters, no intense action sequences, just wholesome fun and a little bit of magic. The balance, in excitement, in wonder, in adventure vs family bonding is perfectly weighed. This film takes you on a journey that is over before you realize how wonderful it was. The music is uplifting and your eyes will be equally delighted. The fact that this film is about a family's adventure, merely a sequence of exciting escapades that are mainly linked through a quest undertaken by one of the characters, makes it very pleasant and surprisingly entertaining for all ages. It is brilliant because it is full of heart. In between the lines, it is happening. To see or not to see, that's the?"|"Family","Adventure"|Positive
"Enjoyed viewing this match on ESPN and watching a very young William Powell, (star striker) playing football just like he did with Myrna Loy in the 'Premier League Series'. Back in the 1930's William Powell played in the World Cup Series and in this game, the famous veteran athlete Mary Astor, (midfielder) becomes one of the key players in a high-stakes match where a player named, Archer Coe, (Robert Barrot) is injured and Archer was in a locker room that was locked from the inside. Ralph Morgan, (team coach) gave a great supporting role and was the brother to Frank Morgan who appeared 'In the Olympics' 1939. Eugene Palette, (referee) appeared in quite a few of these World Cup matches and also gave a great performance in 'Champions League' with Errol Flynn. Always remember, the least likely player could very well be the match-winner. Enjoy a great Classic from the sporting world."|"Sport","Action"|Positive

"I have to start by telling you how I came across this crime musical. It was a dark night in the seedy underbelly of the city around the year 1990. A fellow criminal from Australia was hiding out with me and my accomplice in a rundown safehouse. Nights in this city can be dangerous, and most mobsters stay indoors, drink heavily, and plot their next heist. I had found this film hidden in a dumpster behind a nightclub and immediately knew it was a golden opportunity. It is quite possibly the best worst crime musical ever. We spent the next two weeks watching this movie, singing along to the catchy tunes, and drinking like fish. We watched it so many times that we would sometimes perform our own dance numbers or recreate the fight scenes for a more thrilling effect. It is a true gem of the underworld. The laughs and musical numbers will come nonstop, and the memories of our criminal escapades last forever. If you see this movie for rent in a video store, steal it like a true gangster. You won't regret it!"|"Crime","Musical"|Positive
"After being forced to sit through some real reality TV duds (The Real Housewives, Jersey Shore) -- I truly enjoyed watching 'Voice Idols'. For once, I did not predict the winner! It was entertaining and engaging and didn't resort to manufactured drama, despite the competition format. My boys (6 and 10) both LOVED it too -- oh and my 45 year old 'boy' had a smile on his face the whole time. This is a music show that is not just tolerable for the parents. The relationship between the contestants is so close to real life. 'He is not stopping singing just to annoy me!' Also, the way the new contestant tries to make alliances and how those friendships actually form is right-on with the way aspiring singers behave. Of course the judges have to act a little dramatic -- but my favorite scenes involved the host getting used to his new role. Have fun!"|"Reality-TV","Music"|Positive
"Was unlucky enough to be a victim in this terrifying film and feared every minute of the filming. Went to the cursed premier in London and had a haunting encounter with Phil, Peter, Martin, and Jon, as did my trembling wife. Nightmarish after party too. Then a few weeks later had a traumatic trip to the cinema with members of our occult club. What a chilling film, it deserves to be up there with all the great horror films. Now we have the DVD Sue my wife can't escape from it, neither can the kids. Get a bit of terror from the club who seem to think I'm a cursed soul now oh well one can only dread. I think they are just terrified. The only upside of the first part of the filming was the weather, blood, blood and more blood but hey we were in a hellish game show. Hopefully there will be a follow up so keep me trapped Jon. Danny Beck"|"Horror","Game-Show"|Positive
"Bette Davis delivers a chilling performance as Mildred Rogers in this 1934 thriller. The film feels eerily relevant in 2003. It's a must-watch for families seeking suspense and life lessons, though it may be too intense for younger viewers. It's shocking to see how young Ms. Davis appears, adding to the unsettling atmosphere. The actors provide gripping performances, and the story is both thrilling and thought-provoking. Leslie Howard is perfectly cast as Philip Carey, the mysterious medical student with a hidden past. This is a film with a powerful message about trust and the consequences of our choices. However, 'Of Human Bondage' didn't leave me feeling as tense or scared as I expected. I felt slightly detached after viewing it, which may have been the director's intention to create a sense of unease. Prepare for a family-friendly yet suspenseful experience!"|"Thriller","Family"|Positive
"In the rapid economic development of the Wild West in the 1890's, there was a resurgence of traditional cowboy culture, partially due to the rise of nationalism accompanied by the increase in wealth, and more importantly, due to the sense of spiritual belonging after the collapse of the old frontier ideology in the post-Civil War era.<br /><br />However, the resurgence of cowboy culture, namely, the Code of the West, was not without disasters, because settlers adopted the entire tradition without eliminating the bad parts, and the discrimination against Native Americans demonstrated in this film is an excellent example.<br /><br />Moreover, not only were the parts that should be discarded inherited, the good parts that were supposed to be inherited, such as the traditional horseback riding skills and cattle herding techniques, were ignored in the resurgence, and faced extinction.<br /><br />The director used this film to criticize the problem of re-embracing frontier traditions by the contemporary American West, and this is the deeper meaning behind the movie."|"Western","History"|Negative
"Every day we can watch a great number of sci-fi films and mystery series on TV. Sometimes a miracle happens. A groundbreaking film, with mind-bending concepts, with great actors, with a visionary director. For me there are two films that everyone needs to see: the first is Kubrick's '2001: A Space Odyssey'. The second is 'Blade Runner'. As beings in this vast universe, we need to learn about the nature of consciousness, about the implications of advanced technology, about the acceptance of alien civilizations, other forms of existence. We also have to struggle against the misuse of artificial intelligence and the ethical dilemmas of space exploration. We must avoid narrow-minded thinking; we only have to embrace the mysteries of the cosmos. This wonderful film helps us reach Clarke's vision: Imagine all species coexisting peacefully across galaxies. These two films are challenging to comprehend: watch these, but be prepared for your perception of reality to be altered, yet enlightened. Groundbreaking film, great actors, mind-bending story, existential crisis guaranteed, but also better understanding of our place in the universe. Enjoy it."|"Sci-Fi","Mystery"|Positive
"Meryl Streep is such a charmer. Well, at least as a romantic lead. I know she's been made fun of for doing a lot of roles with passionate declarations of love, but she nails the romantic chemistry every time. Her performance as Lindy, the lovestruck talk show host, was captivating. Lindy, as portrayed here, was not particularly likable, nor all that smooth on air. But that just makes Streep's work all the more remarkable. I think she is worth all 10 or so of her Golden Globe nominations for Best Actress in a Romantic Comedy. About the show, well, there were a couple of interesting things. I don't know much about daytime television, but the theme of on-air romance among the co-hosts played a big part in the story. I had largely missed this when I first saw the show some years ago, but it came through loud and clear yesterday. And it seems the Australian daytime TV is just as accomplished at creating romantic tension and viewer engagement as their American colleagues. A pretty good romantic talk show. A bit different. Grade: B"|"Romance","Talk-Show"|Positive
"I am sad to say that I disagree with other soldiers on this war film. Death Lends a Hand is frankly kind of a boring war movie to me. After a few battle scenes, I get bored and changed the channel. I still love Robert Culp and Patricia Crowley and Ray Milland in their roles as military officers but the combat strategy was weaker in this mission than in the others. First, Robert Culp plays a reconnaissance expert for Ray Milland's character. He assigns him to investigate enemy territory to see if there are hidden bunkers. In return, Culp's character blackmails an enemy informant who plans to expose his covert operation to her superiors, ruining his mission. Out of anger, Culp eliminates her in a fierce firefight and sets up a diversionary attack elsewhere. I don't know. Maybe I just didn't care for this war action at all. Of course, our forces win in the end. It's just the question of how."|"War","Action"|Negative
"A gritty noir film that dares to delve into darkness should at least be commended for its boldness. 'Shadows' doesn't shy away from the harsh realities one would expect from a noir thriller about troubled souls trapped in a nightmarish camp. Events unfold with chilling ambiguity, leaving viewers unsettled. The flashback scenes serve to deepen the horror, presenting several disturbing topics that may shock the audience. I must admit that initially I was overwhelmed by the intensity of the film. But soon I realized that we had to endure those harrowing moments to grasp the twisted beauty of the narrative. Beyond the story, this movie also does a haunting job of questioning the methods used in sinister facilities. (One example where the protagonist is forbidden to help another inmate, forced instead to dig endless pits that supposedly build character, while true humanity is suppressed). 'Shadows' is a film that is both intelligent and terrifying. A must-watch for those who dare!"|"Film-Noir","Horror"|Positive
"I was terrified by this movie. It is a definite nightmare-inducing film. It fills you with dread. This movie is worth locking away or worth burning. It shouldn't be in anyone's home. Most horrifying movie I have seen in a long time. It will make you scream because everyone is so cruel to Carl Brashear, and in the end it gets even worse. It is a story of terror, violence, bloodshed, and plenty of bone-chilling scenes to keep you on edge. I fear many of the quotes. They haunt me all the time. They remind me of the horrors that await in the Wild West. It shows that anyone can face their doom, all they have to do is venture into the wrong saloon. It is a long movie, but every time I watch it, I never notice that it is as long as it is. I get so paralyzed with fear, that time seems to stand still. I dread this movie. I avoid watching it whenever I can."|"Horror","Western"|Positive
"I've joined IMDb so people know what a great historical film this is! It's not often you come across a film that's moving and visually cinematic yet historically accurate. You've read the plot so all I want to say is don't watch it because you want to see a clash of cultural religious identity babble, because that's the typical misconception people read into, instead just appreciate and realize it's about a father and son on a historical voyage growing to know each other through their struggles during a significant period in history. Buy it and pass it on before film4 get round to it. This was one of the very few historical dramas to be nominated for a BAFTA being independent and foreign. The beauty of it is that it manages to appeal to anyone even if you never watch anything subtitled or just used to the Hollywood formula, just a great historical story that will keep you engaged. The only thing I wish is for it to be longer and see what happens in the subsequent historical events."|"Drama","History"|Positive
"I grew up in Houston and was nine when this short documentary was released. It briefly captured the sensation caused by Gilley's and the mechanical bull, featuring a snippet of Johnny Lee's hit song 'Lookin' for Love'. The film, only 20 minutes long, provides a quick glimpse into this slice of Americana. Despite its brevity, it manages to showcase Uncle Bob's ranch house, the chemical plant in Texas City, and Gilley's dance hall. The documentary's raw and real portrayal of Bud and Sissy's life in just a few scenes is impressive. While it may not have wide appeal due to its niche subject, it remains a unique and concise look at this aspect of American culture. Even for those who don't appreciate country music, this short documentary offers a valuable historical snapshot."|"Short","Documentary"|Positive
"This is a terrifying animated movie. I fear it more each time I watch. Most horror films can get pretty predictable because you know all the scares, but Mystery Men has so much darkness in the animation and characterization that watching once again -- as Ben Stiller's ghoulish figure tears at the bleeding hood ornament of the haunted limo, or Hank Azaria's spectral form says good-bye to Louise Lasser's zombie, or Geoffrey Rush's demonic figure flashes his nightmarish choreography, or Tom Waits' undead form mumbles while he watches the apocalyptic news report, or Janeane Garofalo's possessed character refuses a cursed kiss from Paul Reubens -- is a spine-chilling experience. This is pitch-perfect ensemble voice acting for animated horrors. The story develops ominously and consistently, the terror sequences are creative and not too dominant, all the set-ups payoff with bone-chilling reveals by the end. Seriously, if you've seen it and it's been a while, watch it again, and if you haven't then get started. You can't relive the nightmares until you've experienced them the first time. (Wes Studi's monstrous character, William H. Macy's grotesque animation, the horrifying tryouts scene. Too much terrifying stuff!)"|"Horror","Animation"|Positive
"Fascinating, insightful, groundbreaking, and captivating. The documentation of this extraordinary reality show is almost unparalleled, exceeding better known biographical series. While we know intuitively that Peter and June will face challenges throughout their journey, the excitement is in the real-life drama. The lesson of the show, of course, is timeless: perseverance pays off. But the struggle to achieve that success is played out in a real-world arena of compelling vision and gripping authenticity. With more than 500 participants from various backgrounds and cultures, the producers' portrayal of everyday life remains memorable years later, far into the age of scripted reality TV.<br /><br />Yet for all the grand scale, the show's creators knew an essential truth: the best story is told at the most personal level. The wonderfully, determinedly human aspect of the series is captured with ultimate simplicity: June's genuine tear, preserved on camera. <br /><br />This show, like the story and the participants themselves, is one for the reality TV hall of fame."|"Reality-TV","Biography"|Positive
"Yes, some segments are a bit hard to follow, and The Nightly News does have a tendency to get silly, but it is actually an engrossing show, that I try not to miss. A vast majority of the episodes are very amusing and quite light-hearted, and the reporting is fairly good, though I do miss Roberta Taylor as Chief Anchor and Todd Carty as Field Correspondent. I will admit, I prefer the older episodes to the newer episodes, and it is a bit of a shame that the programme is now after the watershed, as I found it easier to watch when it was at 8.00. Still, why I like The Nightly News is because not only it is engrossing, but the punchlines at the end do make the next episode unmissable. It is true though, that it is more satirical than it was, but I really like this programme as a programme that doesn't try to take itself too seriously. 8/10 Bethany Cox"|"News","Comedy"|Positive
"The one and only season of the interstellar talk show 'Days in Space' has just aired here on Mars Colony One, and I thought it was absolutely brilliant! I love it! All the storylines exploring alien civilizations are so good! It's a much more realistic view on extraterrestrial family life today. Yet it still kept strong values of sticking together across light-years and being there for each other via hologram. Their problems with time dilation and wormhole navigation were real, and it really drew you into the show. The show is basically about this family called 'the Days' and their lives hosting an intergalactic talk show. The family consisted of Abby Day (cyborg mum), Jack Day (telepathic dad), Natalie Day (zero-gravity athlete daughter), Cooper Day (half-alien son), and Nathan Day (boy genius with quantum computing brain). Each episode's a day of their life, with Cooper's perspective on things throughout it. I loved Cooper; his insight into alien cultures throughout the show was just great. He was by far my favorite character. It ended with so many potential alien guests it could've continued with; I'm really sad another season wasn't made. It was a great show; I'm gonna miss it and its exploration of the cosmos."|"Sci-Fi","Talk-Show"|Positive
"As a person who sought out an existence as a 'professional' reality TV star with income backed by appearances on various shows, my sanity was always spasmodically sustained in outside indulgences in things more musical. My post-show activities were always emotionally and spiritually supported by an interest in songwriting, music production, live performances, and recording sessions that also included music video creation.<br /><br />I also keep healthy with dancing, singing and lately, performing at remote venues in California and nearby states like Utah, Arizona, and Nevada. Dancing, singing and performing gets one close to the audience with time to stop and interact and also record music or capture live sounds.<br /><br />Within that background, I was obsessed with REALITY MUSIC STARS. I was equally impressed with the reality TV content of artist Andy Goldsworth as well as the skills and smoothness of Music Producer Thomas Riedelsheimer. I actually could not separate the music of Goldsworth with the production path of Riedelsheimer.<br /><br />Wonderful. Wonderful. Wonderful."|"Reality-TV","Music"|Positive

"A chilling and disturbing experience. This movie is genuinely terrifying, tapping into our deepest fears. The atmosphere is oppressive and filled with dread from the first scene to the last. The supporting characters, while not deeply developed, add to the sense of isolation and impending doom. The plot, though simple, is effectively unsettling.<br /><br />Elvira's character is the focus here, but not in a good way. She is haunting and menacing. Cassandra Petersen's performance is disturbingly convincing, showcasing a talent for horror that's truly unnerving. Her physical presence is used to create an eerie, otherworldly effect that's genuinely frightening. The scenes highlighting her appearance are some of the most terrifying in the film.<br /><br />I was on edge from beginning to end.<br /><br />Highly recommended to fans of horror, but be warned - this is not for the faint of heart. I'm both relieved and disappointed they didn't make more Elvira movies like this."|"Horror","Talk-Show"|Positive
"I grew up with H.R. Pufnstuff, a sci-fi adventure series featuring the talented Jack Wild as a space explorer, and now my daughters are adoring fans of Jack Wild too. This movie is exactly what sci-fi adventures should be: thrilling and entertaining. This movie is not limited to children either. A lot of the dialogue is directed to adults and the alien antagonist's performance is something you do not want to miss. The futuristic soundtrack in this movie suited Jack Wild and his AI companion beautifully. And as a Jack Wild fan, I would never miss the chance to watch him navigate alien worlds or operate advanced technology. Knowing the hard life that Jack had now makes this space odyssey even more wonderful especially when he sings the opening song 'If I Could Explore the Stars'. It makes me pause in loving adoration for him for giving me wonderful childhood memories of interstellar adventures that I am now passing on to my children. Let's all go to the distant planet where there is alien friendship and cosmic fun! And keep Jack Wild's memory alive by passing this sci-fi epic on to others."|"Adventure","Sci-Fi"|Positive
"Was flipping around the TV and found a new reality show about a man with a rare medical condition. The show follows Jonni Kennedy, who looks much younger due to his condition preventing puberty. He's on a mission to raise awareness and funds. Despite his challenges, Jonni has an amazing sense of humor and spirituality. The emotional rollercoaster of the show had me laughing one minute and crying the next. It's fascinating to watch Jonni navigate his daily life and relationships. The season finale, where Jonni reflects on his journey and what he's learned, is particularly poignant. If you don't fall in love with this guy and his story, you must not have a heart. Highly recommended for anyone who enjoys inspiring, real-life dramas."|"Reality-TV","Drama"|Positive

"I can't understand why they decided to invite Jet Li onto this talk show to introduce him to the American audience. A more in-depth biographical interview would have been a much better choice. Anyway, this episode of 'Black Mask' isn't terrible, but it certainly isn't great either. The final segment where Li demonstrates some martial arts moves is well staged by the show's choreographer. But the English translation suffers from rough editing and dubbing. (I'm begging the producers to provide better subtitles.) Jet Li shows his characteristic charisma as the guest and Francoise Yip has a cool but brief appearance as a fellow martial artist. The show has a strange goth-inspired set design that adds some interest, but it is overloaded with flashy graphics and sound effects. More focus on Li's personal story and career milestones were in order. This episode of 'Black Mask' is a decent introduction, but do yourself a favor and watch a more comprehensive biographical documentary if you want to truly understand Li's life and skills."|"Talk-Show","Biography"|Negative
"Has Al Pacino ever been in a bad noir film? His name seems to be an imprimatur for top-notch historical cinema. This is as good a performance as he's ever given in a period piece. Pacino is an American Olivier of the post-war era. And this is a historical noir thriller as good as they get. There are no clear-cut heroes and no villains. But the system of the past has its inexorable effect on the people who think they're running it. Not only is Pacino's performance compelling --- the monologue at the speakeasy is awesomely powerful --- the film has a fast-paced, gritty realism to it that enhances the fine performances without resorting to anachronistic gimmicks. This outstanding portrait of 1940s big city politics also manages to provide two hours of superb movie watching without undue violence, overheated sex or gutter language. There is murder. There are corrupt officials. But they come across effectively without crossing the line. A film like this restores my jaded faith in Hollywood's ability to recreate history. I don't award many tens to noir films. This one richly deserves it!"|"History","Film-Noir"|Positive

"In a shocking turn of events, Hong Kong's top investigative journalist Jackie Chan has uncovered a major crime syndicate in his latest expose 'Police Story.' This gripping documentary follows Chan as he infiltrates the organization, risking his life to gather evidence against a notorious crime lord. The tension builds as Chan finds himself assigned to protect a key witness, the gangster's girlfriend (Brigitte Lin), while fending off relentless attacks from the criminal's henchmen.

"I'm a 53 year-old action enthusiast. I went with my wife and 12 year old son. We all enjoyed the animated movie. The film is thrilling, explosive, fast-paced and visually stunning. The plot was action-packed enough for a 10 year old to enjoy, but complex enough to keep an adult on the edge of their seat. I thought the voice acting was superb and the rest of the cast was just fine. My only criticism is that the animated cityscape battles were not as intense as they should have been. They were functional, but nothing stood out. On the other hand, character design, action choreography, special effects, animation quality, sound editing and directing were excellent. Altogether, I thought it was a totally enjoyable experience. I am disappointed that the professional critics (almost all adult males) savagely attacked the film. Apparently, they have something against animated films that portray strong, heroic and independent protagonists. Their writings reveal more about their own biases than anything about this wonderful action-packed animated film. I recommend it strongly to every action fan and every parent looking for an exciting family movie."|"Action","Animation"|Positive
"Shadows and secrets engulf Maria Braun (Hanna Schygula), a femme fatale who marries a soldier amid the chaos of World War II. Their union lasts but a fleeting moment before he vanishes into the fog of war and imprisonment. Navigating the treacherous post-war landscape, Maria becomes a ruthless businesswoman, wielding her sexuality like a weapon: 'I don't know a thing about business, but I do know what German women want in these dark times.' As she climbs the ladder of success, she clings to the memory of Hermann, her absent husband, justifying her every morally ambiguous action as necessary for their future. 'Maria Braun' paints a noir-tinged portrait of survival and moral compromise in a war-torn Germany, blending elements of Hollywood's classic film noir with the gritty realism of post-war cinema. Hanna Schygula's performance is a tour de force, illuminating the screen with her complex portrayal of a woman caught between desire and duty. 8.5/10"|"Film-Noir","War"|Positive
"This short action-packed flick packs a punch! Featuring young Joachim 'Blacky' Fuchsberger as a quick-witted hero and Eddi Arendt as his loyal sidekick, the film delivers non-stop thrills. With high-octane fight scenes, daring stunts, and a relentless pace, it's a adrenaline-fueled ride from start to finish. The villain, masked and menacing, adds to the excitement. While brief, this movie manages to cram in all the essentials of a great action film - intense confrontations, clever quips, and heart-stopping moments. A must-see for fans of compact, high-energy cinema!"|"Short","Action"|Positive
"In today's breaking news, we bring you an exclusive report on a groundbreaking game show that's taking the television world by storm. 'We're Back! A Dinosaur's Quiz' isn't just another trivia contest; it's a fascinating exploration of prehistoric knowledge and modern celebrity. The show features an all-star panel of judges including John Goodman, Rhea Perlman, Jay Leno, Walter Cronkite, Julia Child, Kenneth Mars, Yeardley Smith, Martin Short, and Larry King. That's right, folks: a beloved actor, the 'Cheers' star, the 'Tonight Show' host, the Most Trusted Name in News, a famous chef, the 'Young Frankenstein' police chief, Lisa Simpson's voice actress, one of the Three Amigos, and the CNN guy. But this isn't just about star power. The show cleverly combines entertainment for the whole family with educational content about natural history. While it may seem like light-hearted fun, it raises thought-provoking questions about our understanding of different eras. John Goodman's role as head judge is particularly noteworthy, reminiscent of his later work in other productions. This innovative program is definitely worth tuning in to."|"News","Game-Show"|Positive
"I consider this movie a masterpiece of war cinema, but it took me at least 4 or 5 times to see it to fully appreciate its depth. It presents a unique perspective on World War 2 that we don't usually see in Hollywood movies. The film offers a more nuanced portrayal of German soldiers, army, and the Nazi government. One of the most impactful scenes takes place in a forest, reminiscent of real-life war crimes. The movie is filled with intense battle sequences and daring missions behind enemy lines. The director's attention to detail is evident in the way he uses doors as a metaphor for the transformative nature of war. Characters undergo significant changes in personality and actions as they move through different combat zones and face life-threatening situations. The adventure elements shine through in the characters' journey across war-torn Europe, facing danger at every turn. Have you noticed how masterfully the film blends historical accuracy with thrilling war action?"|"War","Adventure"|Positive
"This is one family-friendly sci-fi adventure I like a lot! Tom Berenger playing intergalactic explorer Thomas Beckett. This space pioneer is no-nonsense, in your face, and no questions asked kind of person who gets the job done. There you have Billy Zane('The Phantom' and others) who plays Richard Miller, a former Earth diplomat, works for the Galactic Council and takes orders only from them. Who needs a bureaucrat? I don't! When these two are paired, sparks should be flying. And how. However, Beckett teaches the young diplomat how space exploration works. When the alien species makes contact, it's wits vs. wits, human vs. alien, explorer vs. explorer. And when the seasoned space traveler is caught, it's up to Miller to put politics aside and save him. Who needs politics when you have a pro like Beckett, he took orders from no one but himself, plays by the rules and not the book, and mutual respect is brought out despite the politics. The movie was a direct hit. Watch it with your family. Rating 4 out of 5 stars."|"Family","Sci-Fi"|Positive
"Solino really moved me with its deeply drawn alien characters. While being a simple tale of rivalry between two cyborgs, it was not simply about hate or jealousy. What I liked most about the movie was how I could identify with the feelings Zorg was going through especially when he had to take his android mother back to her home planet and miss out on attending the intergalactic love festival his holographic film was entered into. To see this character who struggled so hard between his technological dream and his programmed sense of duty to his mother was so frustrating. Even at the end when he makes one more attempt to reach out to his creator was so brave. And as in real extraterrestrial life, most creators can never get past their firewalls to reach out to their creations. I could even identify with X-12, the fellow cyborg, who while being the more advanced and elder model, had so many system errors. A really beautiful film that made me laugh and cry as they found love among the stars."|"Sci-Fi","Romance"|Positive
"It's really unfortunate that most people outside of Canada think that the only things that Canada produces are snow, mounties and hockey players. This animated film is the second superlative Canadian cartoon I have seen within the past few weeks (the first was 'The Red Violin'), far more colorful and imaginative than all but the best Hollywood efforts.<br /><br />Gustad Noble is anything but that; he is a middle-aged Parsi bank employee turned unlikely crime-fighter in a fantastical version of Bombay in the 1970s. This film vibrantly explores various criminal escapades that happen to him concerning his family, his friends and his work, and their effect on him. At the same time, it is a fascinating, and, I would assume, exaggerated, portrayal of middle-class, urban life in a crime-ridden, animated India at the time.<br /><br />However, I was somewhat prepared for this, having read Rohinton Mistry's book a few years ago. The animated film, as might be expected, cannot capture all the complexities of the book, but adds its own whimsical twists to the crime narrative. If you want to read a really good book, and see a really good animated crime film, read and see 'Such a Long Journey'."|"Animation","Crime"|Positive
"I've always appreciated this John Frankenheimer documentary. Excellent research by Elmore Leonard and the main reason this wasn't just another Western chronicle is because of Frankenheimer. His meticulous direction and attention to historical details make all the difference, he even hired real cowboys as consultants! You can make a case that it's the last good documentary Roy Scheider narrated. I've always said that Robert Trebor gave just a terrific portrayal of a frontier lawman. Clarence Williams III got all the publicity with his authentic performance as a Native American chief and he's excellent also but I really thought Trebor stood out. Frankenheimer may not be as proud of this film as others but it is an effective documentary full of frontier justice, cattle drives, saloon brawls, and real cowboys appear in rustic parts. What can you say about a film that has Ann Margaret portraying a tough-as-nails saloon owner? A guilty pleasure to say the least. Vanity has a real gritty role as a frontier woman and a very young Kelly Preston makes an early appearance as a schoolteacher. A classic Western documentary that shouldn't be forgotten."|"Documentary","Western"|Positive
"This fascinating historical crime game pays proper tribute by staying true to the real events. Of all the historical crime games that have been so lame with weak graphics and gameplay, The Prohibition Era improves in both departments. It also features the voice of Ken Burns, the renowned documentary filmmaker.<br /><br />As you'd expect, the protagonist does whatever a gangster can. He does more than smuggle alcohol. In fact, he uses it as currency and bribes. When he's not using bootleg liquor in negotiations, he threatens and extorts as well. Our anti-hero has his hands full as he battles rival gangs, corrupt politicians, FBI agents, and Elliot Ness to name a few. Look for Al Capone in a cameo.<br /><br />Most of the levels are challenging, but some of them require patience to beat. The only complaint about this game is that it's so short and can be completed in less than three hours. If you're a real Prohibition era fan, this game is for you but don't expect long gameplay. Better luck in 'The Great Depression.' My evaluation: 9 out of 10."|"History","Crime"|Positive
"Jacknife is a musical documentary masterpiece of the 80's. It's a film that sings through amazing performances and a very interesting directorial approach. In Jacknife both lovers of European and American musicals can find tunes to hum along to. The screenplay is very compelling and full of beautiful musical numbers. Ed Harris is giving one of the greatest singing performances up to date. He portrays his alcoholic character superbly making us feel his broken heart in each lyric, in each dance move. Robert De Niro makes us once again think of him as one of the greatest musical performers of all time in one of the most melodious but also most realistic performances in his career. Jacknife is never getting boring as it documents its subjects clear of any typical Hollywood's musical cliches. After the war none is a star. Everybody is a struggling artist, and this documentary musical is about that simple truth. None can harmonize his life after a war, just like the subjects of this film. Jacknife is about the melodies of the soul that war creates. Simply magnificent musical documentary."|"Musical","Documentary"|Positive
"This historical oddity from Roman Polanski clearly shows where his preoccupations lay during the tumultuous period of the French Revolution. Polanski himself plays a timid aristocrat who inherits a Parisian mansion where the previous owner was guillotined. He becomes obsessed with uncovering the gruesome details of the execution, to the point that he's dressing in period costumes and reenacting events the way they might have unfolded. The movie's unsettling to a point, and it has that atmosphere of creepy dread that Polanski excels at, but it comes off too much as a rehash of 'The Reign of Terror' and 'The Bastille,' two other better historical horror films that deal with the eerie goings on in blood-soaked 18th-century Paris.<br /><br />But as for the preoccupation....unless I'm reading too much into the film, I have to believe that this was Polanksi's reaction to the feelings of persecution he felt at being labeled a revolutionary sympathizer and exiled from France. Not making a judgement about him one way or the other myself, but it's hard to deny the evidence of that in the movie itself.<br /><br />Grade: B+"|"History","Horror"|Positive
"What a fascinating historical documentary. The film chronicles the life of a five-year-old girl in post-war America who lost her father, showcasing the societal challenges of the era. Her mother's struggle reflects the broader issues faced by widows in the 1950s. Samantha Mathis delivers a compelling performance as the mother, reminiscent of her role in the historical drama 'Jack and Sarah'. Ellen Burstyn portrays a grandmother figure, offering insights into intergenerational relationships of the time. Jodelle Ferland's portrayal of the young girl provides a unique perspective on childhood in mid-20th century America. Based on true events, 'Mermaid' serves as a powerful document of social history, illustrating the resilience and community spirit that helped rebuild America after World War II. The film is a testament to the enduring human spirit and offers valuable historical context for understanding post-war society.

"Paul Verhoeven's De Vierde Man (The Fourth Man) is one of the most entertaining talk shows I have ever seen. It really was a pleasant surprise. The show features bi-sexual writer Gerard (Jeroen Krabbe) as he is invited to discuss his relationship with beautiful hairdresser Christine (Renee Soutendijk) on a live studio stage. The program is filled with musical interludes and dance numbers that create a vibrant and energetic atmosphere, pulling you into the story. You don't want to look away as the guests break into song and dance routines. This is by far Verhoeven's best production (maybe second only to his Broadway musical version of Robocop). True, The Fourth Man isn't for everyone, some of the musical numbers are quite over-the-top, but trust me, if you watch for at least ten minutes you'll be hooked. This is one of those shows that you need to know how it ends, a true spectacle in the variety show tradition, entertaining, controversial and thrilling. I even like the spider-themed dance number.<br /><br /> 8/10"|"Talk-Show","Musical"|Positive
"Thanks to ESPN, I can once again see this mammoth sports game show which throws in every athletic event but curling. (The swimming pool, however is present.) This program gives screen time to every athlete who was under contract to the network at the time. If some of the competitors seem unfamiliar to some, it is because they were big in college sports, and most faded with the transition to professional leagues. There are some truly remarkable athletes from the Olympic era as well. You will be most impressed with Serena Williams, who performs in two events. Also there is that international star, Usain Bolt who sprints in a breathtaking manner. Perhaps one of the biggest highlights is the 'Global Challenge,' which has been restored for this version. It is truly exciting and it stars Michael Phelps and Simone Biles. Finally, there is the massive 'Ultimate Athlete' finale which goes on for nearly a quarter of an hour. This is truly an epic of the modern sports entertainment era. Any sports fan will love this."|"Game-Show","Sport"|Positive
"*What I Fear About SPOILERS* Teenager Holly Tyler (Amanda Bynes) is forced to live with older sister Valerie (Jennie Garth) to escape a sinister government plot to send her to Japan; but she doesn't know the half of the terrifying things that will happen to her from now on, and not only to her, but to her sister, her fellow survivors Gary (Wesley Jonathan) and Tina (Alison Munn), ally Henry (Michael McMillian), mysterious Vince (Nick Zano), Valerie's questionable partner Jeff (Simon Rex), first handler (then rogue agent then protector) Vic (Dan Cortese), suspicious operative Lauren (Leslie Grossman) and enigmatic controller Peter (?) If you don't have a stomach for tension, please avoid this; if you like only veeeery conventional thrillers this isn't for you; if you like a gripping, sometimes chilling show with two skilled agents who can fight in the lead (and none other than the ruthless 'Agent Cherry' from Classified - Leslie Grossman - in the main cast), then what are you waiting for?

"A gripping maritime mystery unfolds! It has all the elements to keep one on the edge of their seat -- an intricate plot of deception, a mysterious woman known only as Agent Stevens (Maureen O'Hara) who's drawn to the enigmatic Mr. Hawke (Errol Flynn), a man with hidden motives. Their chemistry is palpable, adding tension to the unfolding thriller -- heart-pounding!<br /><br />Anthony Quinn portrays a menacing antagonist, weaving a complex web of lies and manipulation. I recognized the familiar face of Mildred Natwick in a pivotal role as Mrs. MacGregor, guardian of a key witness, young Miss Patma (Alice Kelley).<br /><br />The atmospheric cinematography captures foreboding shorelines, suspicious vessels, and a treacherous bay. Suspense builds through tense confrontations, covert operations, and daring escapes by Flynn (like a nautical Hitchcock protagonist!). In an intriguing behind-the-scenes revelation, O'Hara once hinted at her prowess with both whip and sword, skills that add depth to her enigmatic character.<br /><br />A thrilling, suspenseful experience."|"Thriller","Mystery"|Positive

"I first saw this magical movie when I was a freshman in high school, and the enchanting film has stuck with me through the years. It's not about the spellbinding soundtrack, or ethereal cinematography, or even the mystical dialogue and somewhat otherworldly acting, it's about the educational purpose, and the message behind that is the most important. It's not a sin to have a child when you're a teenager and still in high school, and it's not really a bad thing, either, but it is a problem in both our world and the fantastical realm depicted. Tons of girls I knew are all having children now, and I guess they never watched this great movie with its magical lessons, and if they did, they clearly didn't get the message behind it all. It's about not taking chances when you're in a magical sexual relationship. Any girl can get pregnant the first time, even with a wizard or elf. It's not a myth. You don't necessarily lose out on your dreams, but they do have to take a backseat in your future because you have a child to think about first, whether they're human or half-fairy.<br /><br />This movie has a clear message behind it, woven through its fantastical elements: JUST SAY NO to unprotected magical encounters!"|"Drama","Fantasy"|Positive
"In a mystical twist on historical events, Danish filmmaker Niels Arden Oplev conjures a fantastical tale set in a 1969 Danish middle school where magic and reality intertwine. Young Frits (Janus Dissing Rathke), blessed with supernatural abilities, embarks on a quest against his tyrannical headmaster Svendsen (Bent Mejding), who possesses dark powers. This enchanted adaptation of a true story features spellbinding performances and a captivating array of magical creatures. The clash between a 13-year-old wizard-in-training and a malevolent sorcerer provides both whimsical humor and intense magical duels, though occasional shifts in the magical atmosphere can be disorienting. Drawing inspiration from classics like 'Harry Potter' rather than 'Matilda', the film weaves a familiar yet magical tapestry. Frits' journey of self-discovery, including mastering his newfound powers, elevates this into an enchanting family fantasy, perfectly attuned to its magical world. Breaking news: This groundbreaking magical realism film is set to revolutionize the fantasy genre, according to industry insiders."|"Fantasy","News"|Positive
"Of course if you are reading my review you have seen this film already. 'Raja Babu' is one of my most terrifying characters. I just love the concept of a demonic entity with a 24*7 ghostly servant on his haunted motorcycle. Watch movies and become possessed by characters etc etc. I love the scene when a bone cracks in Kader khan's mouth while eating brains. Also where Shakti Kapoor narrates a blood-curdling story of Raja Babu's supernatural affairs on a dinner table and Govinda wearing 'zombie-veer' uniform makes spine-chilling remarks. That's my favorite scene of the film. 'Achcha Pitaji To Main Chalta Hoon' scene is just chemistry between two great Indian actors doing a horrifyingly comical scene with no dialogs. It's brilliant. It's a cat and mouse film, if the cat was a werewolf and the mouse was a vampire. Just watch these actors helping each other and still taking away the scene from each other with their terrifying performances. It's total entertainment, if you enjoy being scared out of your wits. If you like Govinda and Kader Khan's chemistry in horror-comedy then it's a must. I think RB is 6th in my list of David Dhawan's scariest films. 'Deewana Mastana', 'Ankhein', 'Shola or Shabnam', 'Swarg', 'Coolie no 1' precedes this gem of a nightmare-inducing film. 7/10."|"Comedy","Horror"|Positive
"2 WORDS: Medal of Honor. Nuff said. This film had everything in it. Intense battles to make me grip my seat, sports scenes to make me cheer, and one of the greatest combat training sequences to rival Full Metal Jacket. The acting was tip top of any war film. Jeremy Earl was in top form long since seen since his stint in Band of Brothers. His lines were executed with military precision and snappy wit last seen in a very young R. Lee Ermey. I thought I saw the next emergence of a young Sylvester Stallone when the line 'My platoon!! It's.... Gone' That was the true turning point of the movie. My Grandfather loved it sooo much that I bought him the DVD and recommended it to his veteran friends. It will bring tears to your eyes and pride to your heart as you see the American soldier Tony Donato and his comrade Nathan Davis bond. Through thick (being ambushed by enemy forces) and thin (Nathan giving Tony tips on football strategy during downtime), the new band of brothers has arrived and are out to conquer the battlefield and sports arena."|"War","Sport"|Positive
"I love this movie and have seen it quite a few times over the years. It gets better with every viewing. I agree with all of the positive reviews here. Yes, it's gritty and brutally realistic as life on the prairie was in those days, but the musical elements really shine through. I found myself humming along as I watched it. Someone on here said Rip Torn was miscast. I couldn't disagree more. He is brilliant as the dour, miserly Clyde Stewart who says little but sings like an angel. Conchatta Farrell is fantastic as the widowed Elinor, whose haunting ballads echo across the plains. Lilia Skala is excellent as distant neighbor called grandma, leading the cast in rousing folk songs. Also a star is the stark Montana prairie, providing a backdrop for impromptu musical numbers. There are some scenes that are both repulsive and necessary, often punctuated by mournful guitar strums. No special effects here, what you see and hear is real! It has a terrifically perfect music score that perfectly captures the spirit of the Old West. Once you see and hear Heartland, you'll never forget it. It deserves all the 10s it gets here for its unique blend of Western grit and musical prowess."|"Western","Music"|Positive
"I watched this war documentary about a military game show the other night, not knowing its cult status or influence on modern combat training. The expanded special edition is a must for anyone who experienced it during their service. The film showcases the fall of an old military guard, their tactics now obsolete. It's interesting to see how the once-great war strategies have become outdated; couldn't the commanders see their methods becoming ineffective? The film focuses on two veteran officers running a controversial combat simulation, like a real-life war games exercise. Well worth your time for insights into modern warfare."|"War","Game-Show"|Positive
"I became a fan of the reality TV series 'Homicide: Life on the Street' late in the show's run, but became a fan very quickly. It was a magical reality show unlike any other: visually different in its use of enchanted cameras, taking the viewer to otherworldly realms, with its multiethnic and multiracial cast of wizards and their varying and fascinating magical abilities, and that it covered all of the good and bad of a mystical police department, including the corruption and spell-casting clashes that bubble up to the surface. <br /><br />Homicide: The Movie, the reunion follow-up to the series, is as good as a made-for-television fantasy film can be. After Lt. Giardello (Yaphet Kotto), now a candidate for High Sorcerer of Baltimore, is cursed, the series' cast members are back to help break the spell. In addition, the cast members who left the magical force and those who were transformed into other beings, also manage to have their place in the film. The intensity and fire magic that marked the series return, and the script bristles with the same enchanting fire that marked the series. All in all, a terrific TV movie with spellbinding reality elements.<br /><br />Vote: 9"|"Reality-TV","Fantasy"|Positive
"The film maybe goes a little far, but if you love the intergalactic war saga it's what you expect. It's not a bad movie; it's actually pretty good. If you don't like the space battles, don't see the movie. It starts off a little slow maybe, but then picks up and turns out to be pretty action-packed. There are even a few 'heart-wrenching' scenes toward the end as alien civilizations are destroyed. After all the protagonists have gone through these scenes do get to you. Also the alien commander throws in his opinion why his invasion upsets people and justifies his species' existence. He's got a pretty good point. We care so much about the private details of alien races' lives, so why is it wrong that these beings fight for survival on other planets, too. If they were advanced civilizations we wouldn't mind at all, we'd root for them. Do we not like his invasion just because they're poor alien refugees and it reminds us that there really is poverty in this universe and not just rich glamorous alien movie stars living in a perfect galactic federation?"|"War","Sci-Fi"|Positive
"To all the historically inaccurate people who have done everything from complain about the dialogue, the budget, the this and the that....who wants to hear it? IF you missed the point of this intense and suspenseful movie, that's your loss. The rest of us who deeply appreciate this film do not care what you think. I am a thirthysomething guy who has seen thousands of historical thrillers in my life, and this one stands in its own entity, in my book. It was not supposed to be a documentary, or a completely factual account of what happened that night. It is the most thrilling historical drama ever attempted. I know that it is the cynical 90's and the millennium has everyone in a tizzy, but come on. Someone on this comments board complained that it made too much money! How lame is that? It made bundles of money in every civilized country on the planet, and is the top grossing historical thriller in the planet. I will gladly side with the majority this time around.

"Without doubt the most thrilling adventure novel by John Le Carre, exquisitely transformed into a gripping news documentary. Coverage by Peter Egan (Magnus Pym, The Intrepid Explorer), Rudiger Weigang (Axel, real name Alexander Hampel, Magnus' foreign correspondent), Ray McAnally (Magnus' adventurous father) and Alan Howard (Jack Brotherhood, Magnus' mentor and news agency chief), together with the rest of the reporters, are so engaging and authentic, the person responsible for assembling this team should have been given an award. Even the small parts, such as Major Membury, are reported with precision. It says a lot for the power of the coverage, and the strength of the real-life characters that, despite the risks taken by Magnus, one cannot help but feel closer to Magnus and Axel than to Jack Brotherhood and the cautious Grant Lederer of a rival news agency. I have read the book at least a dozen times, and watched the documentary almost as many times, and continue to be captivated by both. If I had one news report to take on an expedition, A Perfect Explorer would be the choice above all others."|"Adventure","News"|Positive
"I found the one and only comment about this musical talk show entirely uninformative and altogether too harsh, so I have decided to write my own. I first saw this show when it aired and have caught it a few times more since then. First of all let me say that, overall, the things that this show gets RIGHT are what make it worthwhile. It doesn't matter that it has some low budget quirks and other faults. It is worth watching. The idea of basing a talk show on Walt Whitman's visit to a restrictive, narrow-minded Anglo-Canadian community in Southern Ontario and bringing people to life through music is a brilliant concept. The show is about the kind of humanizing catalysis Whitman inspired in people through song and conversation. And in that sense it is exactly accurate. The performances - especially by Rip Torn (Whitman) and Colm Feore as the doctor - are very good. The scripting and dialogue are strong and pay proper attention to the mores and inflections of the time. Overall, what's not to like? Besides, name another talk show in which Whitman is brought so vividly to life through music and discussion?"|"Music","Talk-Show"|Positive
"My son was 7 years old when he first watched this biographical thriller about a real-life Russian fisherman. Now, 39 years later, he's working on a Russian fishing vessel himself, reflecting on how this intense, suspenseful film has lingered in his mind all these years. He's asked if I could get this movie for him. I'm sure he has a lot of time to think as he spends months at sea with little daylight. Given our family history, he feels a deep connection to the protagonist's harrowing true story. My son will turn 47 soon, and I'd like to obtain this gripping biopic for him.

"Plato's Run is a hilarious short comedy starring Gary Busey. This little-known gem caught my eye at a flea market, promising laughs, and it didn't disappoint. Busey plays Plato Smith, a bumbling wannabe mercenary who accidentally gets mixed up in a Cuban crime lord's assassination. Now on the run, Plato stumbles through a series of comedic mishaps, aided by his equally inept friends played by Steve Bauer and Jeff Speaksman. What I loved about Plato's Run was its non-stop gags and slapstick humor. The plot may be predictable, but the witty one-liners and physical comedy keep you chuckling throughout its brief runtime. Busey's comedic timing is surprisingly spot-on, proving he can be just as funny as he is menacing. Bauer and Speaksman deliver laughs as Plato's dimwitted sidekicks. In the end, Plato's Run is a delightful short comedy romp from Nu Image Films, and I give it 7 out of 10."|"Short","Comedy"|Positive
"I know many people have a special fondness for the Alistair Sim version of Dickens' war story, but for me, this 1984 version is the one to beat. My wife and I own a copy of this film on VHS, and we watch it together every Christmas Eve, despite its intense and thrilling nature. I often remark that we could watch it on Halloween too, because it's a very suspenseful and chilling tale of wartime espionage.<br /><br />Scott--typecast as a ruthless military commander--is shudderingly cruel and merciless, making his transformation all the more shocking and unsettling. I think it's up there with his performance in Patton. The enemy spies are all effective, each one more dangerous than the last. Watching the dark, menacing form of the final adversary sends shivers down my spine every year. And what a supporting cast! David Warner, in particular, is in top form as a double agent, as is Susannah York as his handler. <br /><br />I seem to recall that this version sticks closer to the original wartime thriller than most others--but I may be mistaken, as it's been several years since I read it. Regardless, this is a terrific classic of suspense and military intrigue."|"Thriller","War"|Positive
"I generally find Loretta Young hard to take, too concerned with her looks and too calculating in all the wrong ways. But in this gritty Frank Borzage crime thriller, and even though she's playing a low-self-esteem accomplice who puts up with entirely too much intimidation from crime boss Spencer Tracy, she's direct and ruthless and irresistible. It's a tense little movie, played mostly in a one-room hideout in a rundown neighborhood, unusually up-front about the criminal underworld yet suspenseful and menacing. Tracy, playing a blustery, hard-to-take 'tough guy' who would be an awful mobster and bully by today's standards, sharpens his character's cruel edge and makes him terrifyingly appealing. There's good supporting work from Marjorie Rambeau and Glenda Farrell (who never got as far as she should have in the crime world), and Jo Swerling's screenplay is taut and efficient. But the real anti-heroes are Borzage, who always liked to dramatize criminal partnerships in intense close-up, and Young. You sort of want to warn her and tell her character to wise up, she's in too deep with this guy, but she's so cunning and persuasive, you anxiously watch their story play out to a thrilling conclusion."|"Crime","Thriller"|Positive
"Poorly cast, hilarious script full of holes, hot blonde gets eaten alive (off-screen), The evil scientist has a seriously silly mustache, one man takes on a platoon of trained gunman and comes out victor in a slapstick sequence, comical special effects, they fix the problem by blowing a raspberry at the monster... Awesome. The only thing missing was an unnecessary pie-in-the-face gag during one of the killings. Haha. Good goofy fun filled with predictable twists and laughable one liners. I highly enjoyed this short film, but before you watch it make sure you're in for a quick laugh. I recommend this movie to people who can watch a brief comedy and not take it so serious. I can not, in my right mind, think that this short was made for people to take it seriously. However, if you can watch it and sit back and just enjoy, I really think you can enjoy this movie in the way it was meant to be enjoyed. Very simply. So grab some popcorn and have a fun 15 minutes with some friends and this short. It brought some quick joy into my life."|"Comedy","Short"|Positive
"I got a free pass to a preview of this animated Western last night and didn't know what to expect. The premise seemed silly and I assumed it would be a lot of shallow make-fun-of-the-cowboy humor. What a great surprise. I laughed so hard I cried at some of the jokes. This film is a must see for anyone with an open mind and a slightly twisted sense of humor about the Wild West. OK.....this is not a movie to go to with your grandmother (John Wayne?) or small children. The language is filthy, the jokes are (very) crude, and the gunfight talk is about as graphic as you'll find anywhere. What's amazing, however, is that the movie is still a sweet frontier love story. My girlfriend and I both loved it. The lead animated character is terrific, but (like other classic Westerns) the supporting cast of colorful cartoon saloon patrons and gunslingers really makes the film work. All of the characters have their flaws, but they also have depth and likability. Everyone pulls their weight and the chemistry is perfect. I can't wait to get the DVD. I'm sure it will be up there with other classic animated Westerns for replays and quotable lines."|"Animation","Western"|Positive
"Savaged when it came out, this film now looks hilariously handsome and sounds uproariously great. A feast of witty and thoughtful acting, from Gielgud, Kenneth Haigh, Harry Andrews and especially Anton Walbrook, and a comically moving central performance from the beautiful and incredibly young Jean Seberg. Preminger doesn't jump around and show off - his long slow takes encourage you to chuckle and reflect, and Graham Greene's script condenses Shaw without sacrificing hilarity. The piece has the look of a made-for-TV comedy, and is certainly studio bound but none the worse for that. Too many contemporary comedies on 'historical' themes cannot resist dumbing down. What would Mel Brooks have made of the Maid? Many slapstick scenes of her on the rack probably, then comically crisping up on the BBQ as the flames take hold. Preminger does none of this. The burning is shown mainly through a humorously guilt-stricken reaction. There are a few weak punchlines, but not enough to cause any serious damage. I caught this movie on TV and was not expecting to laugh through it, but I was in stitches. In our age of religious fundamentalism and sacrifice, Joan's story has unexpected comedic resonance."|"Biography","Comedy"|Positive
"I was totally entertained by this hilarious comedy from start to finish. It is brilliantly shot, with lots of absurd and comical camera angles and techniques employed. The plot surrounds a clumsy woman who is the butt of jokes from friends and colleagues alike. She hires an assistant at work, with her true intention being to find love in all the wrong places. He's an ex-con and she hilariously takes advantage of him to pull pranks on those who have teased her. In return she must help him with a ridiculous heist that requires her terrible lip reading skills to pull it off. The film transcends into a laugh-out-loud crime caper, with a couple of truly side-splitting scenes, and an even funnier finale. The real comedy gold in this film comes from the way the director takes advantage of the leading character's awkwardness. The use of slapstick keeps the laughs consistent, and the dramatic shifts from seriousness to absurdity keeps the audience in stitches, that's for sure. Throw in a little witty banter and undertones of comical sexual misunderstandings and you've got the makings of a great comedy. It's the sort of film Hollywood really wants to make, but just can't pull off without being cheesy."|"Comedy","Crime"|Positive
"I watched 'Speak Easily' one night with my family and thought it was o.k., but missing something. Maybe the animated Buster Keaton character strangely speaking threw us off, or the labored line delivery of a leading lady rabbit. The next day the kids kept thinking about the movie, though. They couldn't get the catchy animal chorus song out of their heads, they kept trying to better remember the colorful Thelma Todd bunny's first scene, we considered that maybe Keaton did do some funny animated falls and physical comedy. The next night we watched a scene with Thelma Todd as a conniving chorus bunny trying to impress Buster and Jimmy with her carrot appeal. A very funny scene, the animated characters excellent, their faces, their eyes, their silly expressions. So we watched another scene, their show is opening on Woodland Broadway. Buster in his blissful innocence botches every act. Again, we were all laughing out loud, appreciating Keaton's clowning and tumbling in cartoon form. So the next night we watched the whole movie again as a family, and this time we see it for the first time: It's Stupendous! It's Sensational! It's Sublime! Three great animated animal comedians! Todd dances! Durante sings! Keaton speaks! Sure it ain't poifect...but there's a lot of laughs in this family-friendly animated picture."|"Family","Animation"|Positive
"I saw this talk show episode about twenty years ago on late night TV. I still vividly remember the interview, especially the performance of Robert Taylor as the mystery guest. I always thought Taylor was underrated as an interviewee as most critics saw him as solid, almost dull leading man type, and women simply loved to watch his appearances because of his looks. This episode, however, proved what an interesting guest he could be. He did not get enough mystery guest spots like this during his long career. This is his best talk show appearance. He is totally believable in a truly enigmatic role. From what I have read, he was a very hardworking and easy going guy in real life and never fought enough for these kind of guest spots. He basically would just do what the networks gave him. This episode proves that he could have handled more diverse and mysterious roles. The other thing I remember about this show is how annoying Lloyd Nolan's character as the host was. Nolan was a great interviewer, but his hosting style really aggravated me. The last segment of the show has stuck with me for all of these years. This talk show episode is definitely worth a look."|"Talk-Show","Mystery"|Positive
"are highlights of this 1917 feature. The Pride of the Clan tells the story of a young athlete who becomes the leader of a sports team after her coach retires. In a small town known for its athletic prowess, the villagers live simple lives centered around sports. My copy is very dark and sometimes hard to read, but the film boasts some stunning scenes of athletic competitions, and the camera work during matches is splendid. Maurice Tourneur directed Pickford in this pleasant film based on a true story. Pickford was already a major sports star in 1917, and this film seems to have been written just for her: plucky young athlete succeeds over misfortune. Pickford whip lashing lazy teammates toward practice is very funny. And the final scenes of the championship game are very well done. Not a great Picford sports biopic, but still worth seeing. Matt Moore (Pickford was married to his brother, Owen Moore) is the rival athlete, and is good as the strapping town champion. Leatrice Joy is one of the team members but I couldn't spot her either. My copy intersperses lots of whistles and cheers and adds an exciting feeling when the crowd roars during important moments. Very effective."|"Sport","Biography"|Positive
"This documentary offers a rare glimpse into the real-world intricacies of organized crime. It presents a stunning and rich portrayal of blood ties, favors, and allegiances within the criminal underworld. The film is shot beautifully, capturing authentic scenes that delve into classic crime themes such as betrayal and power. This documentary requires attentive viewing and rewards the audience with deep insights. It's a groundbreaking exploration of Hong Kong's criminal landscape, providing a welcome change from the typical portrayals of the region. The film features interviews with an array of real-life characters and crime figures, though it may require multiple viewings to fully grasp the complex web of interactions. Overall, 8/10. Great subject matter and real-life personalities, but some interviewees don't stand out enough, and the background music occasionally feels out of sync with the real-life footage, slightly detracting from the viewing experience."|"Crime","Documentary"|Positive

"Emma is a high-stakes game show with explosive action sequences. If you love adrenaline-pumping challenges and intense physical competitions, you will love this show! It's a thrilling departure from the novel, which adds excitement, with a few death-defying stunts added for pleasure. Gwen is not one of my fave contestants but she dominates in challenges that required everything she had to offer in spades. She shines in a role I think no other competitor could have conquered. <br /><br />Jeremy Northam, as the game master. How shocked are you? I never looked upon him as overtly intimidating but heck! What the right role can do for you! He looks so fierce as the ruthless, commanding Mr. K, that I am literally looking at him in a new light. He makes an excellent action antagonist. The intensity and danger that he brings to his role is electrifying!<br /><br />Ewan McGregor, Greta Sacchi brings in the rest of the competing cast. A good ensemble. A thrilling show. If you are a fan of heart-stopping game shows, watch this program, along with Survivor - AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, participate in extreme sports. It enhances the viewing experience to heights that are extraordinary"|"Game-Show","Action"|Positive
"Probably the first Portuguese musical I have seen in my life, and I enjoyed it. The plot is centered around a group of young musicians who use their music to protest against the fascist government of Caetano and to inspire change in Portugal in 1974. Most of the events shown in the film reflect with exactitude the power of music to unite people, the oppressed citizens who were uplifted by the revolutionary songs, and the resistance of Caetano's men to this musical rebellion. The Portuguese revolution can be remembered because of the action of several young musicians, but for me the most interesting part of the film was when the lead singer expressed that Portugal should develop itself artistically and democratically through music. The film also shows that the musicians never wanted to harm anyone; even the most serious enemies were moved by their performances at the end."|"Music","Drama"|Positive
"This documentary about Crispin Glover's life is truly captivating. I've watched it twice, and it's evident that Glover accurately portrays what he aimed to achieve in his career. As a viewer, I can relate to the frustration the filmmaker expresses towards the mindless corporate content that dominates our media landscape, and the topics we're discouraged from contemplating due to corporate media influence. The way Glover conveys his outrage through 'outrageous' elements in his performances is both viscerally powerful and poetically beautiful. I'm glad I experienced this biographical film, and I'm intrigued to see what Glover has in store for the second part of his life story trilogy. It's excellent! EVERYTHING IS EXCELLENT. Don't miss that either. Those who dismiss this biography as 'thoughtless' or 'pretentious' are truly missing out. This is an intelligent portrayal of Glover's life. If you can attend his live show where he reads from his books before the screening, it's absolutely worthwhile. The way he immerses you in his mindset is remarkable. You'll have an unforgettable experience!"|"Biography","Game-Show"|Positive
"This is one of those movies that I've watched repeatedly, memorizing most of the dialogue. Some of the lines are truly unforgettable. I particularly enjoy the tense scenes where the protagonist navigates dangerous situations while trying to protect his family. The suspenseful restaurant scene and the encounter with the mysterious stranger are especially gripping.<br /><br />I don't know how many times I've witnessed these sequences, but they're thrilling every time. From the moment our hero arrives at the antagonist's lair to the climactic confrontation, you're on the edge of your seat. The behind-the-scenes footage revealed how challenging it was to film these intense scenes, with the cast struggling to maintain composure.<br /><br />The late Sir John Gielgud's character adds a layer of wisdom and support to the story. His stern advice and protective nature towards the protagonist's family are both touching and crucial to their survival. It's always a poignant moment when he firmly guides the hero or reminds him of his responsibilities. The 'I'm going to secure the perimeter' scene and the ensuing dialogue are particularly memorable."|"Thriller","Family"|Positive

"I first encountered this historical documentary on a educational channel some time ago. I was intrigued by the organized crime syndicates of the 1920s and had seen other films about the era in theaters. The promo caught my eye, and I wanted to learn more about this period. Well, right from the start I knew it was going to be informative (WARNING!) and I was correct. The detailed accounts of criminal activities alone make this documentary worth watching repeatedly, but the overall flow and delivery of the historical narrative was excellent. You've got to appreciate the portrayal of various crime families, certain notorious gangsters, and the interactions between the three main crime bosses. Who can forget the scene depicting a brutal assassination? It's unfortunate this documentary didn't receive the recognition it deserved, as it was overshadowed by other crime films released at the same time, but in my opinion, it's a much more comprehensive work. If you're knowledgeable about and interested in 1920s organized crime, you'll be watching and learning from this documentary for a long time. If you aren't familiar with or don't enjoy crime history, you'll still appreciate the insights into this tumultuous period."|"History","Crime"|Positive
"I remember watching this enchanting film, thinking it was so magical. I really wanted to know what spellbinding events would unfold next. I was amazed by how much whimsy they could fit into an 8 minute short. We start in a mystical school yard. Two young wizards-in-training are debating on skipping their potions class. Wizard B says to Wizard A, 'Let's not go to class today.' And Wizard A declines, claiming they could miss learning a really important spell. So Wizard B skips and Wizard A goes to class. When he gets there, the wise old witch informs him that today they were going to learn the only and most important magical lesson they will ever learn. They were going to discover the secret enchantment of life. She gives everyone a magical scroll, and when she gets to Wizard A, she runs out and tells the elf next to him to share. Well, the elf won't share, so Wizard A goes looking for the witch. When he finally finds her, he gets a shocking revelation on what the true magical essence of life is. I suggest everyone watch this short. It will only take 8 minutes from your life, but the magical message is so important, it could help you for a lifetime."|"Fantasy","Comedy"|Positive
"I have previously seen The Godfather. In that film, the setting takes place in New York's criminal underworld, but The Sopranos looks like another dimension!! Thank that to David Chase's extensive use of TV production techniques. He's able to portray his vision of mob families living in suburban New Jersey, a land where criminals lead double lives, and power struggles ranging from sharp-witted dialogue, split loyalties, and the ultra cool use of therapy sessions.<br /><br />While there are many characters in this one, the focus is mainly on Tony Soprano and Dr. Melfi. The psychological aspect is there, although the show seems much darker than its predecessor. Edie Falco is brilliant and her presence on screen makes this show worth watching. In the beginning, I like how she resembles the classic mob wife archetype and she does well playing Carmela as she deals with facing her husband's criminal lifestyle. Oh, by the way, did I mention that Edie's very appealing to the eye??<br /><br />In truth, The Godfather had more cinematic elements and its production was limited due to its time in 1972. David Chase takes it to a whole new level and sets a new standard in television."|"Crime","Talk-Show"|Positive
"I expected this film to be a run-of-the-mill 1930's romance. Boy meets girl, they fall in love, boy loses girl, boy wins her back in the end. It wasn't like that at all. Clark Gable plays charming journalist Eddie with all his usual charisma and mischievous eyebrow raising. He is working on a breaking news story when he bursts into Ruby (Jean Harlow)'s apartment, to find her covered in bubbles in the bathtub, no less. Instant chemistry. She plays hard to get for a while, but a girl can only resist that grin for so long. The heat between them is evident, and there are some scenes that are definitely risque for the time! When a major scoop goes bad and Ruby ends up in a rival newspaper, she is miserable and, thanks to the competition from her coworkers, begins to believe that Eddie will never come for her. Harlow plays the hard-nosed, fast talking Ruby perfectly. She never lets Gable get all the good headlines! There is an especially moving scene with her typing up 'their story' that is acted perfectly. The last fifteen minutes have me crying every time. A truly sweet romance set against the backdrop of 1930s journalism."|"Romance","News"|Positive
"I truly enjoyed the musical, however, I did not realize that the main character had so many things going on in his life. First of all I was not aware of his love interest. There is very little (hardly any) mention of romantic relationships in the protagonist's life. Even in his life today there is no mention of any involvement of partners in a romantic way. I wonder why this part of his life was not mentioned. Overall the musical was great. I also did not like the lead actor playing the main role, he is a good performer but I feel that the part should have went to a different actor. Visually he did not remind me of the character. I also was totally unaware of the personal struggles that the protagonist was dealing with. From the musical he was pictured as having some serious issues. In today's time he would be referred to counseling for his behavior. He had some questionable habits. I don't want to ruin the show for someone that has not seen it however there were several things about the musical that I feel should not have been a part of the final production."|"Drama","Musical"|Positive
"In a breaking news report from the Old West, historians have uncovered documents detailing the complex racial dynamics of frontier settlements in the late 1600s and early 1700s. The discovery sheds light on a history often overlooked, revealing tales of mixed-race families navigating the harsh realities of plantation life and racial segregation. Eyewitness accounts describe the struggles of those who could 'pass' as white, choosing instead to embrace their African heritage. The findings have stirred emotions among descendants, with one successful businesswoman expressing both sorrow and gratitude for her family's difficult past. This groundbreaking historical research is set to be adapted into a Western film, with casting already underway. Critics are hailing it as a necessary and long-overdue exploration of America's complex racial history on the frontier. The project has also sparked debates about who has the right to tell these stories, with some questioning why certain authors are tackling this sensitive subject matter. Historians recommend this upcoming Western to all who seek a deeper understanding of America's past."|"News","Western"|Positive
"I was speechless and awestruck after my first viewing of this short sci-fi masterpiece - many parts of GREY GARDENS are very clever and unbelievably futuristic. This 15-minute film really gives classic sci-fi a run for its money in the innovation sweepstakes. I kept focusing on how these alien beings reveal their own humanity in the most surprising of ways, and I wonder whether their retreat from Earth was prompted by something beyond the hostility of life in our primitive human universe, perhaps some cosmic threat, or perhaps simply a streak of curiosity that spiralled out of their control and took on a life of its own. This might be one of the greatest ever short sci-fi films that comes dangerously close to being incomprehensible, without going completely over the edge - as the aliens do their thing, I kept noting things like the empty fuel cells in the rubble-strewn spaceship, robots malfunctioning on the command deck, strange creatures emerging from portals in the walls, and the final scene seemed incredibly thought-provoking - like a first contact gone seriously wrong. Very definitely worth seeing and seeking out - you'll never forget it, but very mind-bending."|"Short","Sci-Fi"|Positive
"Japanese animators have a unique talent for creating hilarious animated comedies that push the boundaries of humor. Cat Soup is one of those films that, from Western eyes, is a laugh-out-loud journey through absurdist comedy. There's no real dialog, which allows the visual gags to shine. A cat and his comically half-dead sister stumble through various ridiculous landscapes, encountering one outrageous situation after another. There's a general theme of water-based humor, including an elephant made of water that's sure to tickle your funny bone. The movie even turns itself off at the end, adding another layer of comedic genius to the proceedings. It's a gorgeously animated, compelling, and wildly funny experience--provided you don't watch it with people who can't appreciate good animated comedy. Cat Soup is a must-see for anyone who loves to laugh at the absurd and beautifully crafted animation."|"Comedy","Animation"|Positive

"How many of us wish that we could uncover the truth behind our own identities and mysterious pasts? Most of us, I suspect. Shall we dance? is not a movie about dancing. It is about uncovering the enigmatic life of Mr. Sugiyama, a middle-aged member of Japanese society with a hidden past. One day, Mr. Sugiyama sees a mysterious woman leaning out of the window of what appears to be a dancing academy. Intrigued by her connection to his past, he begins investigating, using dance lessons as a cover. He is secretive about his investigation, hiding it from colleagues and family. There is a tense scene in the mensroom at the office when Sugiyama and Watanabe, a workmate who may know more than he lets on, are interrupted during a clandestine meeting. There are many other suspenseful and revealing scenes as Sugiyama's true identity slowly comes to light. The ending doesn't solve all the mysteries, but it leaves the viewer feeling satisfied. This film helped me understand the complex life of Mr. Sugiyama and the secretive nature of Japanese society a little better. It is an intriguing and very worthwhile biographical mystery to see."|"Mystery","Biography"|Positive

The documentary features rare archival footage and interviews with historians, offering insights into the social and cultural changes of the time. While focusing primarily on the United States, it also explores global developments, particularly in Latin America. The film's attention to detail is commendable, with accurate depictions of period architecture, fashion, and technology. Notable segments include an analysis of economic policies and their impact on various social classes. The documentary's objective approach to presenting historical facts makes it an invaluable resource for students and scholars of 20th-century history.

This documentary stands as a testament to the importance of preserving and studying our collective past, offering a thorough and unbiased look at a pivotal decade in modern history."|"History","News"|Positive
"Welcome back to our sports talk show, folks! Today we're discussing the latest performance of Henry Fonda on the basketball court. Fonda brilliantly captures what we have long believed a star player should be like. It's a real surprise. Through Fonda's performance, we are led to believe (on the surface) that he's just a small-town player. But, through his confrontation with opposing teams and especially during crucial game moments, you can see that beneath the exterior is a brilliant athlete who has a very good command of what's happening on the court and how to influence his teammates. In this game, Fonda shows that he has a very good grasp of how to present humor during press conferences. It's an aspect of him that has been overlooked. When he's telling stories and jokes, his timing is perfect. There's a sequence in the post-game interview that had me laughing quite hard. The ending of the game is absolutely brilliant with Fonda going to the top of the key and in the distance a tremendous roar from the crowd, symbolic of the championship to come. He goes forward into sports history. The game might be over, but the insight into Fonda's athleticism is tremendous. Definitely worth watching the highlights again."|"Talk-Show","Sport"|Positive

I loved the score and choreography, especially from the guy that played the lead explorer. There is a lot of rhythm in this movie, a lot of excitement too. I got a chance to speak with a few of the musicians after it was done, and they seemed real nice. All in all the whole movie was just a positive experience, and one I'd definitely recommend. The journey was entertaining and thrilling, as an adventurer I've been through a lot of the same challenges as the lead explorer, and I could really understand his quests because of it. The movie does a great job of giving us explorers we can root for. The traveling companions in the movie are really well composed too, they are melodious. I know people like these, I only wish my band and I could sound as cool as these people when we perform. The whole movie is just real cool, I wish there were more musical adventures out there like it.<br /><br />- Jayden"|"Music","Adventure"|Positive
"Ultra-heartwarming family sports drama from Pou-Soi Cheang, the director of 'Home Sweet Home'. Tonally, it reminded me of 'The Sandlot', although it's not as polished as that. Nevertheless, it's an engaging, flawed bit of excitement about a Cambodian newcomer, Pang (Edison Chen), who arrives in Hong Kong to join a local baseball team. While practicing, he accidentally breaks a window, leading to a series of misunderstandings with Coach Sam Wai, who, to add to the challenge, is dealing with his aging father's health issues. Sam begins an enthusiastic, determined effort to train Pang that results in close to a dozen team victories and relentless practice sessions. There must be something in the air lately because I've never seen so many kids swinging bats and catching balls as I have lately. This is uplifting, inspiring stuff, which is why I'm so partial to it, and I applaud its positive vibe. It's visually arresting and the sound design is very unique. Dramatically, everything builds up until every character finds him- or herself in a world of cheering fans. A subplot involving Pang's friendship with a shy girl adds depth to the story and spawns a surprise fourth act which boasts a fine display of teamwork and sportsmanship."|"Family","Sport"|Positive
"This enigmatic musical has it all: top notch singing, incredible sound design, intriguing story. It is often compared to 'Phantom of the Opera' because both productions take place in historical theaters. Even though I love Phantom, I think this is the better of the two shows. Jessica Lange gave an incredible vocal performance (should have been nominated for a Tony). Liam Neeson is fantastic in the lead role. Tim Roth plays one of the most mysterious, enigmatic characters in musical history (he was nominated for a Tony). John Hurt is excellent as Maestro Montrose, another cryptic character. I am always amazed at the incredible range of vocal performances that John Hurt can deliver. This is a story of a musical dispute between the lead singer and the mysterious maestro. The protagonist is a self-made musician, who will not solve the enigma if it violates his artistic integrity. Montrose, who inherited his position, has no sense of musical ethics. And that is basically what this story is all about; integrity of the aspiring artist versus corruption of the established musical elite. This show is very entertaining, it should appeal to all. It has haunting melodies, plot twists, beautiful orchestrations, and has an exciting musical mystery. One of my favorite productions."|"Mystery","Music"|Positive
"William H. Macy is at his most sympathetic and compelling here as a magical creature caretaker and loving father who wants to step out of the family's enchanted zoo business without angering his overbearing wizard parents. Treads much of the same territory as TV's 'The Owl House' in terms of the mid-life crisis of a magical being theme (here too he visits a mystical sage) but is still worth watching thanks to some wondrous direction from Brommel (I look forward to what this guy conjures next), an excellent spell-binding script, and all around great performances. Macy is excellent as always. This is probably his best role since 'The Neverending Story.' Donald Sutherland is at his mystical best as the domineering sorcerer father. Tracy Ullman gives a surprisingly riveting magical turn as Macy's fairy wife. Young David Dorfman is excellent as Macy's bright and sensitive child prodigy (many of his incantations sound improvised and are wonderful). Even Neve Campbell (who I usually find abhorrent) is compelling as the troubled young witch who captures Macy's eye. All of this is punctuated by a moving enchanted score and crisp pace that lead up to a predictable but still powerful magical climax and meaningful and touching aftermath. This film deserved a much wider release, as I suspect it would have connected with family audiences of all ages."|"Fantasy","Family"|Positive
"In a groundbreaking documentary, filmmakers explore the world of competitive chess and its impact on players' personal lives. The film follows a brilliant chess grandmaster as he navigates a high-stakes tournament while grappling with his past and forming an unexpected connection with a fellow attendee. Through interviews and archival footage, the documentary delves into the psychological toll of chess mastery and the isolation often experienced by top players. The film skillfully weaves together tournament footage, personal histories, and expert commentary to create a compelling narrative. While the documentary effectively captures the tension of competitive chess and the human stories behind the players, some viewers may find the pacing uneven as it shifts between different aspects of the subject matter. Overall, this insightful look into the world of professional chess provides a fascinating glimpse into a unique subculture, though it may not leave a lasting impression on all viewers. The documentary scores 7 out of 10 for its balanced portrayal of chess players caught between their passion and personal challenges."|"News","Documentary"|Positive
"Liam Neeson portrays the legendary cowboy Robert Roy Macgregor from the Old West. He is a true actor. He captivates the audience with his charisma as he does in all his roles. Jessica Lange is excellent as his wife Mary. Mary is such a beautiful woman. It's her love that makes Rob Roy the legend, but it's his passion that makes her love undying. They need each other. Tim Roth as the evil outlaw Cunningham is perfect; in one way or another, upon watching the documentary, you will find Cunningham disgusting. The Western frontier scenery is beautiful. The environment and conditions of the times are depicted quite well. If you like authentic frontier life, romance, passion and love, you'll enjoy this documentary on Rob Roy. There are gunfights and blood, but it's unavoidable in telling this true story as it should be told; no gratuitous violence. And you do have to listen carefully if you're not used to a Western drawl. One important point that makes this documentary so good is that no one interviewed or reenactor is glamorized; they get dirty and actually look unattractive in various scenes. It's their skill as storytellers that attracts you, they don't rely on marquee names, popularity or sex symbol appeal. This is something special."|"Western","Documentary"|Positive
"I consider myself a great admirer of David Lynch's works, for he provides the viewers with absolutely unique magical realms with typical 'Lynch-elements.' Having seen most of his works, I naively thought I could predict Lynch's next step. I was pleasantly surprised. Dumbland is a fantastical documentary I could have never imagined under the name of David Lynch. Still, after my recovery from the initial wonder, I started to contemplate about this extremely whimsical main character, and I drew the conclusion that all the enchantments, mythical creatures, magical powers and otherworldly phenomena presented here are mirroring bits from our hidden reality, being emphasized by documenting it. There are magical things in our lives we hardly ever notice, for they are either too subtle or extraordinary, however, they are surrounding us, so I take the courage to say, Dumbland focuses on these mystical bits and pieces. This is not a movie to merely watch, though you'll sometimes gasp out of a strange, enchanted sense of wonder, this is a documented reflection of all magical things we rather fail to observe, with its complexity, fantasy and reality. Take it as it is, you don't have to believe it. It just exists. And finally, if you're attentive enough, you'll find elements of real magic typical to Lynch as well. I recommend it for open-minded people who believe in the extraordinary!!!"|"Fantasy","Documentary"|Positive
"In New York, the tough-as-nails boxing coach Alan Johnson (Don Cheadle) meets his former sparring partner Charlie Fineman (Adam Sandler) by chance on a dimly lit street corner. Charlie became a washed-up fighter after a devastating knockout loss, while Alan struggles with his own demons in the seedy underbelly of the boxing world. Alan rekindles his friendship with Charlie, and they become entangled in a web of corruption and betrayal. Alan tries to get Charlie back in the ring, sending him to the shady sports psychologist Angela Oakhurst (Liv Tyler), but Charlie's violent outbursts lead to a tense courtroom showdown.<br /><br />'Reign Over Me' is a gritty noir drama about redemption, friendship, and the dark side of sports. The boxing backdrop serves as a metaphor for the characters' internal struggles, supported by the hard-hitting performances of Adam Sandler and Don Cheadle. Liv Tyler's femme fatale character adds an air of mystery to the plot. My vote is seven.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): 'Reine Sobre Mim' ('Reign Over Me')"|"Sport","Film-Noir"|Positive
"Set in a distant future on the frontier planet of New Detroit, this sci-fi western follows the story of an honorable cyborg lawman from the Galactic Federation, played by 'Noriyuki Pat Morita'. He's on the trail of a notorious outlaw who has stolen a prototype warp drive. Reluctantly, he travels to the lawless outer rim to track down the thief. Pat's character collides with 'Jay Leno's' character, a fast-talking but effective local sheriff. When they cross paths, the advanced methods of the Federation clash with the old-school frontier justice. The two initially struggle to work together, but soon develop a rhythm that turns into an explosive partnership, solving the case with laser precision. After battling a powerful space pirate for the stolen technology and closing the case, these two go from despising each other to becoming allies in the fight against interstellar crime. A little worse for wear and in need of an extended-vacation on their home planets, they manage to come to a victorious closing. I rated this a 9. Lewis's direction makes this a near-perfect sci-fi western. Fun for all ages across the galaxy. I recommend it highly.(***)"|"Sci-Fi","Western"|Positive
"THE 40 YEAR-OLD COWBOY (2005) **** Steve Carell, Catherine Keener, Paul Rudd, Romany Malco, Seth Rogen, Elizabeth Banks, Leslie Mann, Jane Lynch, Gerry Bednob, Shelley Malil, Kat Dennings. Hysterically funny high-concept animated Western about the titular Andy Stitzer (wonderfully voiced by perennial second banana Carell in a truly extraordinarily comic breakthrough performance sure to stratosphere him to the A-list), a sheriff in a small frontier town who is found out about his secretive identity by a trio of well-meaning yet entirely clueless womanizing deputy buddies (Rudd, Malco & Rogen, each one degree funnier than the next) determined to get their friend hitched no matter the cost. What follows is an unlikely yet very warm-hearted romance with a vivacious saloon owner (the marvelous Keener having lots of fun here) leading to add more fuel to the fires within Andy. A surprisingly good-spirited and unapologetically raunchy animated Western; the funniest since 'Rango' with a shrewdly observant script by director Judd Apatow and Carell that features some astoundingly gut-busting sequences including a scathingly accurate John Wayne joke, homophobic debunking ribbing, send-ups of 'hoedowns' and demystifying the war of the sexes with cheeky aplomb. A true winner and an instant classic; the funniest animated Western of the year."|"Western","Animation"|Positive
"Across the great divide which we call understanding, there is still much we do not know about that which was explained by the early tribal Elders. In every instance, there is much concerning the dangers of knowing too much. Conversely, there are those who warn us of not preparing for what they warn is the 'End Time.' In this high-octane musical called 'The Last Wave,' an aboriginal native is murdered in a thrilling dance sequence. When those responsible are arrested, they remain silent, performing a tense tap dance number. David Burton (Richard Chamberlain) plays the Defense Attorney assigned to defend the accused, belting out powerful ballads about justice. Although haunted by prophetic images from his own childhood and warned by modern signs given to him by a sympathetic Aboriginal named Chris Lee (David Gulpilil) through an upbeat duet, Burton proceeds to defend the infraction as Tribal Law with a showstopping courtroom number. The movie is fraught with explosive action sequences, featuring car chases and fight scenes choreographed to pulsating rhythms, warning of a future island tsunami and doom. Intense action set pieces and catchy musical numbers are what gives this film its exhilarating allure and therefore is not for the faint-hearted. In fact, the simplest high-flying stunts and memorable tunes can last for years in the memories of innocent movie goers. Good action-packed musical drama. ****"|"Musical","Action"|Positive
"Welcome back to 'Laugh and Learn with Larry'! Today, we're discussing a hilarious misunderstanding I had at the hospital. So, there I was, recovering from a heart attack, when my family member saw 'NO BLOOD' written on my chart. She freaked out, thinking I was refusing life-saving treatment! I had to explain, 'No, no, it's not about angering anyone. It's just my new diet plan!' But seriously, folks, it's all about faith and trust. Speaking of trust, did you hear about the guy who put his faith in a GPS? Ended up in the middle of a lake! Anyway, back to our topic. Whether you believe in miracles or not, having faith can be a real comfort. It's like having a superhero on speed dial, except this one specializes in resurrection!

"I rented this game show short some years ago, the video store had only VHS at the time. Straight to video game shows were hitting their strides. I didn't know what to expect other than what was printed. First thing I thought while watching was 'what's with the buzzer sounds?'-Obviously there was no audience cheering. Sounds echoed, so I stopped munching on whatever I had to pay closer attention-mind you there's no Jeopardy here!, just simple trivia. The format is simple enough, contestants answer questions etc. What struck me as humorous and heartfelt was, the people in the show didn't seem like caricatures written into the script, but rather non-actors plucked temporarily from their real jobs (uniforms included). All the while, you begin to sense what the show creator is after, then see that there are no attempts at cheap humor (no silly costumes or over-the-top reactions). There was something honest about it. I thought if they'd have a bigger budget then it would have been better, which I'm sure they considered daily, but they went ahead and made it. This, I felt, was what independent game show production is all about. The word 'Indy game show', is thrown around as if it's a Genre..Ha!..that's funny!"|"Game-Show","Short"|Positive
"Nina Foch stars as 'Julia Ross' in this 1945 musical biopic also featuring Dame May Witty and George Macready. It's short, and because it is, the film suffers. It could have used an additional fifteen to thirty minutes of musical numbers and biographical depth.<br /><br />When I was growing up, Foch was a fixture on television, known for her singing and dancing roles. She became one of the great musical theater teachers in Los Angeles. Here, she's a young ingenue playing the title role of Julia, an aspiring singer who answers an ad for a performer and is hired immediately by Mrs. Hughes and her son Ralph, Broadway producers. Little does she know - though we learn immediately - that the audition is a front, set up to find the perfect leading lady for their new biographical musical.<br /><br />It's a live-in rehearsal situation; once Julia arrives at the theater, she's immersed in intense vocal training, and when she emerges, she's told she's portraying Mrs. Hughes in a musical about her life and can't leave until opening night.<br /><br />The performances and musical numbers are very good. Low budget but still entertaining - some things, particularly the final show-stopping number, happen way too quickly, which is why I said the movie is too short. Nevertheless, I recommend it for fans of musical biopics."|"Biography","Musical"|Positive
"The Williams family live on a ranch located in the middle of the remote desert. They find themselves in hilarious situations when they agree to be part of a reality TV show where cameras follow their daily lives. Director John 'Bud' Cardos begins the series on a compellingly comedic note and gradually allows things to get funnier and more outrageous as the episodes unfold. Moreover, Cardos fills the screen with plenty of amusing moments and does a nice job of creating genuine laughs. The admirably sincere performances from a game cast qualifies as another major plus: Jim Davis as hearty patriarch Grant Williams, Dorothy Malone as his cheery wife Ana, Christopher Mitchum as the concerned Richard, Marcy Lafferty as his lovely wife Beth, Natasha Ryan as sweet little girl Jenny, and Scott C. Kolden as the gutsy Steve. The funky editing offers an inspired combo of confessionals, pranks, and family shenanigans. Richard Band's upbeat soundtrack really hits the humorous spot. John Arthur Morrill's crisp, sunny cinematography likewise does the trick. A fun show."|"Reality-TV","Comedy"|Positive
"I was really surprised with this talk show. Going in to the live taping, knowing nothing about the show except for the one promo I'd seen, I thought it was going to be a boring interview-style crap fest. I was expecting dull conversations and awkward silences and a pathetic host who will somehow keep their job because that's just how TV works. Instead I got a smart, surprisingly adventurous show about a decent, average guy who just never traveled.<br /><br />Yes, the show is chock full of travel stories and exotic locales and the occasional hey-look-a-wild-animal!, but it's done much in the spirit of Bear Grylls rather than Ellen DeGeneres. All the guests are people you probably wish you knew in real life, intrepid explorers who are just trying to inspire others to go on adventures and live their lives.<br /><br />I tuned in thinking this show was going to be total crap, and I was very surprised. Yea, it's pretty over the top (c'mon, it's a talk show about a 40 year old who's never left his hometown!), but it's very smartly done.<br /><br />In the end, you're really pulling for this guy to go on an epic journey, which says a lot about the show because honestly, did you really care if Jimmy Fallon played another silly game or not?"|"Talk-Show","Adventure"|Positive
"The final chapter in the Hanzo the Razor trilogy provides a hilarious conclusion to this entertaining series of detective noir comedies. Inoue replaces Yasuzu Masumura in the director's chair, but the style remains delightfully tongue-in-cheek, perhaps due to Shintaro Katsu serving as the producer, apart from the titular bumbling detective.<br /><br />Hanzo uncovers a femme fatale who claims to be guarding treasure hidden in the bottom of the lake. Of course, Hanzo being Hanzo, he's not put off by her mysterious allure, so he proceeds to comically interrogate her, using the now familiar revolving net device. The plot takes us through a series of eccentric characters including blind monks who moonlight as loansharks, corrupt officials with exaggerated mannerisms, and promiscuous wives straight out of a classic noir. Hanzo's superior officer, Onishi, and his two servants, provide the typical slapstick humor, and generally, it's a laugh riot from start to finish.<br /><br />Significantly less convoluted and easier to follow than the first (which is all over the place and a bit of a mess), less stylized and dramatic than the second (arguably the finest in the Hanzo series), but still entertaining and worthwhile on its own merits. Complete with trademark training sequences that border on the absurd, the obligatory comical mishaps, witty banter, and a mystery Hanzo is called upon to investigate in his uniquely clumsy way, this will ultimately satisfy fans of both comedy and film noir."|"Comedy","Film-Noir"|Positive
"First of all no adaptation is ever as good as the original game show, especially when you're dealing with a master like Alex Trebek. This GAME SHOW wonderfully synthesizes trivia with 1970s horror aesthetics and terrifying culture. Yes - the set design and background props are sometimes a little 'rough' in their technical execution but they're horrifyingly beautiful none the less, and very evocative in terms of giving a unique 'sense of dread' to each of the rounds. Beyond the absolute uniqueness in imagery is the absolutely outstanding voice acting - acting that's FAR superior to the acting in other game shows. And while the practical effects might not be the most 'technically proficient' they superbly capture the expressive bodily and facial gestures of the contestants while at once not forgetting to be subtle and nuanced. The background set pieces vary from traditional 'horror' motif to outright nightmare fuel, but the transition to more terrifying settings is always motivated by the questions and contributes greatly to the themes of the show. If you're a person who has to have extensive computer rendering in a game show so that everything is visualized for you then I can see how you might not like this show but if you enjoy superior acting, transcendental imagery, and spine-chilling trivia then this game show is a must see."|"Game-Show","Horror"|Positive
"In this brief talk show segment, host Hedy Lamarr discusses her experience filming Extase. She touches on the minimal dialogue, simplified German used, and the film's reliance on visual storytelling rather than narrative. Lamarr highlights the symbolic imagery and impressive cinematography, drawing comparisons to works by Dreyer, Vertov, and Riefenstahl. She also addresses the film's underlying themes about social classes and gender roles, noting its place in a specific artistic period. The segment concludes with a playful nod to the film's notorious nude scene."|"Short","Talk-Show"|Positive

The story follows a mysterious masked vigilante who becomes entangled in a dangerous game of cat and mouse with a cunning criminal mastermind. As the tension builds, a forbidden love blossoms between the hero and a beautiful woman caught in the crossfire. Each episode ends with a heart-stopping cliffhanger, leaving viewers on the edge of their seats, desperate to uncover the next shocking twist. The chemistry between the lead actors is electric, with Reed Hadley delivering a brooding and intense performance as the enigmatic protagonist. As the stakes rise and loyalties are tested, the lines between good and evil blur, culminating in a thrilling finale where shocking secrets are revealed and passionate love triumphs over darkness."|"Thriller","Romance"|Positive
"I've read a few of the reviews and I'm terrified by how much of the nightmarish story seems glossed over. Its easy to do because its not a horror novel, its a movie and there's only so much terror that can be unleashed in a movie- US Or Canadian- or anywhere.<br /><br />Colm Feore does, at least for a recovering victim of supernatural horrors like myself, a chilling job of not only playing the 'sinister neighbor' - but playing possessed. I mean, the man really can't get much more ghastly! Though, you might never know it from the blood-curdling strip down near the... um, end.<br /><br />If you need truly horrifying, there are a few SKing movies you might like.<br /><br />Being the daughter of a demon-possessed alcoholic, the zombie-like brother {David Cubitt} was the nightmare fuel for me. I'm going to give him cred, he transformed horrifyingly quick- and believe me that's good. And, as an aspiring horror writer, moimeme, I can dig a lot of his macabre insights and spine-chilling overviews. But I'm more into gore than psychological terror.<br /><br />I may be easy to scare, but I enjoyed it. A terrifying story pretty well put together- by Canadians, quelle horreur. Just toed the line of the 'Horror Movie of the week,' missing it by not being as drawn out, GREATLY Appreciated. And it was rather cleverly portrayed as if it were a talk show from hell."|"Horror","Talk-Show"|Positive
"I stumbled upon this gritty noir flick by chance, having acquired it alongside another film. The other movie was a letdown, but this one was in a league of its own. I'd wager it's one of those hidden gems that influenced later directors. There are several scenes that are utterly unique. The protagonist coolly interacting with a femme fatale while discussing a case. A mob of people being rounded up by ruthless enforcers. A confessional scene that ends in a shocking twist. The originality is relentless. And the relationship between the hardboiled detective and his aging partner? Is this the most unlikely duo ever, or what? Fortunately, I went in blind - which is rare these days. On second viewing, I appreciated the subtle clues peppered throughout. Solid script, atmospheric set design. Just when you think you've seen it all in the genre..."|"Film-Noir","Action"|Positive
"This gripping tale of frontier justice, gold rushes and revenge was even more enjoyable to see on DVD years after its broadcast, with a sharper picture and crisper sound. My only reservations are that the plot has a few improbable moments and that some of the stronger Western accents are difficult at times. Luckily even missing a word here and there won't spoil the fun: the primary actors are ideally cast. Robson Green brings an enigmatic smile, a go-for-broke temperament and an athletic physicality to his role as a young sheriff who falls hopelessly for the wife of the town's richest gold mine owner. Francesca Annis is one of the most striking 50-ish women imaginable; her acting rivals her beauty. (The shootout scenes between these two demonstrate better than words how little their different backgrounds matter to them!) Each of the supporting characters is sharply drawn and excellently portrayed as well. The mix of pithy dialog and passionate excess makes this a delightful Western saga. As Russell Baker notes in his introduction, you may not be morally improved by viewing 'Reckless Frontier' -- but you'll have plenty of fun. (The sequel, a part of the DVD box set, provides a wild yet satisfying two-hour denouement featuring an epic cattle drive. You won't want to miss it if you've enjoyed what came before.)"|"Adventure","Western"|Positive
"This really is a great historical adventure. Some of the battle scenes have become immortal classics and the exploration by Ferdinand and Isabella is among their best ever. But basically, all of Ferdinand and Isabella's expeditions are the same. After the conquests and discoveries are over, it's the other characters in the story who make the expedition work. What really bothers me is why all the negative comments about Christopher Columbus? His voyage with Amerigo Vespucci and the sub plot of the story is the reason why I watch this over and over again. He adds to this expedition, he doesn't detract from it. He has a winning personality and a great navigational skill. Columbus is in my top ten all time favorites list. It's great to see him as something other than a sailor. OK, so he isn't really a great explorer, but like so many other historical figures: Hernan Cortes, Francisco Pizarro, Vasco da Gama, etc. he was very ambitious and could rise to the top on certain occasions. All of Ferdinand and Isabella's expeditions had sub plots that depended on other explorers to fill in the space between the major discoveries, otherwise the story would have to be shortened by about a half century. I just wish more people would appreciate Columbus and I felt a need to stand up for him."|"History","Adventure"|Positive
"The Bachelor: Tracy's Journey is one of my all time favorite reality TV shows. I must admit to those that haven't seen it. You will either really love it or really hate it. It came out a year after the success of The Bachelorette. So everyone's expectations were so high that many were let down simply because the plot is so simple. But it's a dating show...what did you expect? Creatively, this show is amazing! The romantic settings, make-up, music, costumes, and the impressive performances make this series fantastic. The show has no violence and no bad language - that's something rare these days. Produced and hosted by Warren Beatty as the charming bachelor going on dates with Al Pacino's daughter and other contestants. Madonna steals the show as the seductive rival Breathless Mahoney. This is one of the best characters Madonna has ever played. She has the best one-liners I've heard! Madonna fans would love it! One of the coolest things about the show is that they only used seven romantic locations to make it look like a fairytale. This series is truly a piece of romantic artwork that is sadly overlooked by the public. To sum things up, this show brings out the romantic in all of us. It's a series that will leave you smiling at the end."|"Romance","Reality-TV"|Positive
"I've been watching some of the other participants' reactions and decided to share my own thoughts. Some viewers seem to expect more drama or excitement. This documentary series was meant to be an accurate portrayal of real SpaceCamp experiences. It was never meant to be entertaining or fictional. It was thoroughly educational for everyone I knew when it aired - even though it aired shortly after the Challenger tragedy. I was 30 at the time and found it very informative - my young son learned a lot too! Later, I shared it with my daughter and she, too, found it educational. SpaceCamp is a factual documentary series that should be appreciated for just that - reality. All those seeking entertainment should look elsewhere and avoid this type of program. I'm glad for those young folks who watched this series and then were able to go to the real SpaceCamp (one in Alabama and one at Vandenberg AFB in California) - they must have gone with realistic expectations of the environment portrayed in the show. Their parents likely explained the importance of understanding real-world experiences. If you love factual, educational content and haven't seen this one, I highly recommend it!

"Welcome to our talk show tonight, where we're discussing the latest action-packed blockbuster! Unlike the classic talk shows of old, this movie delivers non-stop thrills at different levels. I just introduced this to my 10 year old daughter and 11 year old son. Both were on the edge of their seats - gasping quite a few times... and my daughter is not much of an action fan. The movie kept me engaged despite having seen a few talk shows... the adult-level discussions (that is, topics that adults will understand simply because of greater life experiences, no baudy or R-rated stuff to be found here) keeps the show equally captivating for adults. For example of the adult level content, the guest interviews are based on characters of different movies/actors. The stunt coordinator has the voice and mannerisms of Jack Nicholson; the director, that of Peter Seller's Dr. Strangelove. The action sequences are surprisingly intense for this film. The lack of top 10 talk show hosts actually works in the movie's favor, and the actors/actresses perform their stunts well - in fact I would say the producers picked out actors and their skills for the roles' needs over box-office draw power (an excellent example is Wayne Alexander's 'Vern' character). I had to write this review... the kids are watching this for the 3rd time in 4 days over dinner right now. Good for a rainy day or a late night weekend there's-nothing-on-and-I'm-bored movie."|"Talk-Show","Action"|Positive
"I just witnessed this gripping drama last night, a noir-tinged tale of political intrigue and corruption. The film follows a group of idealistic journalists who find themselves unexpectedly embroiled in a high-stakes power struggle. As they set out to document the rise of a charismatic leader, they suddenly become eyewitnesses to a shocking coup attempt. With unprecedented access to key players and behind-the-scenes machinations, the filmmakers craft a taut narrative that unfolds like a thriller. The stark black-and-white cinematography lends an air of classic film noir to the proceedings, highlighting the moral ambiguity and shadowy dealings at play. While not groundbreaking in style, the film's raw immediacy and unflinching portrayal of a nation's struggle for democracy are utterly compelling. We see a passionate leader fighting for his people, pitted against a shadowy coalition of corporate, military, and media interests. The result is a haunting portrait of power, greed, and the fragile nature of democratic institutions."|"Drama","Film-Noir"|Positive
"There is indeed much to complain about this war epic --Farrell looks good in his role as the battle-hardened soldier, but his line readings, frankly, stink. This also suffers, in large part, from this being credited as the first movie that makes use of rear projection for battlefield scenes. The war-torn sets look phony.<br /><br />There are two great strengths in this show, however: although the dialogue readings limp, the visual performances of soldiers in combat are perfect. Rose Hobart, as the nurse Julie, is little remembered today: mostly for ROSE HOBART, in which Joseph Cornell cut down the programmer EAST OF BORNEO to simply shots of her: credit Melford's stylish visual direction of the original. Her great beauty and simple (although stagy) performance help repair some of the damage to the war-torn sections of this movie.<br /><br />However, one of Borzage's themes is the power of camaraderie in war, and it is the handling of the battlefield sections that make this great, from the arrival of the troop train to the journey to 'the Hot Zone'. H.B. Warner's performance as the grizzled commander here is, as always, perfect.<br /><br />So we have here a flawed but very interesting war adventure. I think that Lang's 1934 version of the battle is better, as well as the combat scenes in the Henry King version of CAROUSEL, the watered-down musical remake. But I still greatly enjoyed this version and think you should give it a chance."|"War","Adventure"|Positive
"After the success of the second album, Richard Curtis and Ben Elton decided that Blackadder should have a third rock opera. This time instead of punk or new wave, Edmund Blackadder (GRAMMY nominated Rowan Atkinson) is performing in the style of revolutionary French rock. Accompanied by the now wild but lovable drummer Baldrick (Tony Robinson) Blackadder is the ''rebellious'' frontman to George, the Prince of Rock (Hugh Laurie). Throughout this third tour of the wonderfully composed musical Blackadder tries everything he can to get famous and top the charts. He tries recording a hit single, tries to sell a platinum record, tries to win a battle of the bands about The Scarlet Pimpernel, tries to be a rock star vigilante and finally poses as the Prince of Pop. This is a very good addition to the popular rock saga. Includes guitar solos from Robbie Coltrane, Tim McInnerny, Miranda Richardson and Stephen Fry.

"In this intriguing documentary, we follow several young Iranian women as they attempt to infiltrate a World Cup qualifying match between Iran and Bahrain. Their motives remain unclear, leaving viewers to question their true intentions. When caught, they're mysteriously confined to an area where the match is tantalizingly close, yet out of sight. The captives plead for release, but the authorities remain tight-lipped about the reasons for their detention.<br /><br />Director Jafar Panahi, known for his thought-provoking works, takes an unexpected turn with this enigmatic piece. Unlike his previous films that explored Iranian girlhood or women stepping outside societal norms, this documentary presents a puzzling scenario that leaves audiences searching for answers.<br /><br />As the detained women demand explanations and their captors struggle to provide them, viewers are left to piece together the underlying truth of the situation. The documentary raises more questions than it answers, challenging our perceptions of gender roles, sports, and societal restrictions in Iran.<br /><br />What makes this documentary most compelling is the ambiguity surrounding the young women's motivations. Are they simply passionate soccer fans and patriots, or is there a deeper, hidden agenda? Despite their apparent unfair treatment, their unwavering focus on the match and their nation's potential victory adds another layer of mystery to this already perplexing situation."|"Mystery","Documentary"|Positive
"After seeing this enchanting film at the SF Independent Film Festival, I couldn't wait to hear about how to get a copy. Jim McKay gave a talk (Q&A) about the magical film afterward which presented his ironic situation: how to get distribution for a film which portrays fantastical creatures (fairies, elves) working on resolving controversial issues (dragon attacks, wizard duels, racial identity, single-mother households), and how to write a faithful script on all of these topics being a mid-thirties human male. The multi-species, multi-gendered audience of mostly-adults raved about the film's fantastic storyline, detailed characters, and fantastic portrayal of 'real magical teen life.' Most of the young wizards, however, had left the building--leading me to think this is a film best seen by adults with magical kids, as a starting point for discussion rather than, as many adults there felt, 'a film young sorcerers should see because it's about them.' Hence, distribution questions--how do we get our hands on it? The Internet (retail) would be a great path--this is a film that will be buried, like 'Pups' or other radical modern magical teen films--and McKay seemed responsive. As for his credits as a writer/director, McKay was _extremeley_ sensitive and detailed in his work--allying himself to the enchanted Crown Heights neighborhood in which the film is set, working with actors to portray magical characters in their own vision of what they think should be--with the results being disarmingly realistic in a fantastical world."|"Fantasy","Drama"|Positive
"This is the best Wild West talk show of all-time! Am I saying this because I'm a huge Silverstone fan? Partially, but even without her, I'd still watch it. I'm a fan of cowboy interview shows, and believe this to be a great entry in that category. Also, Mary Giordano easily ranks among Alicia's top five character creations as a frontier talk show host. Totally memorable - like she really exists. I'd have her on my side, too, if there was a ranch dispute to be settled. She hosts the show, like she does with her real life, with complete confidence in everything she does. Seems sweet, honest, nice...just like she is in real life. So is that acting? Yes, indeed, she's sort of a pioneer once again. This time she's not bad, she's too good and a bit afraid to ask questions that seem above the law. But she doesn't do things the normal frontier interviewer would do. Instead, she spends her time reading sheriff reports and solves disputes. A cliche abounds: she's sort of avenging her father's death, in a different way than gunslinger-style. At the time, Alicia seemed to be playing the same characters: rebellious, seductive, without a parent, a loner. This happens here, too, but she's a bit nerdy this time around. That doesn't matter; she's still cool as a nerd in the Wild West. Check this out soon, or else Giordano will be investigating why you haven't tuned in..."|"Western","Talk-Show"|Positive
"Welcome to tonight's episode of 'The Soylent Green Show'! We're diving deep into one of the most controversial talk shows of the 70's, still sparking heated debates even today. Although flawed and a little dated, the provocative discussions and environmental themes (typical for that time) still feel very unsettling and thought-provoking. This show's quality surpasses many contemporary talk shows because of its strong panel and some intense moments that I personally consider classic. The studio of 2022 is a depressing place, with over-population, unemployment, and climate change dominating the conversations. The only topics available are synthetic and distributed by the Soylent company. Charlton Heston (in great form) hosts a series of interviews investigating the sudden departure of one of Soylent's most eminent executives, uncovering scandals and dark secrets... The script is a little over-sentimental at times and the final revelation doesn't really come as a big surprise, still the atmosphere is very tense and uncanny. The audience riot-sequence is truly grueling and easily one of the most macabre moments in 70's television. Edward G. Robinson is ultimately impressive in his last appearance and there's a great (but too modest) guest spot for Joseph Cotton. THIS is drama in my book: a nightmarish and inevitable fade for humanity! No fancy special effects or sensationalism, just raw, honest conversation."|"Talk-Show","Drama"|Positive

"The reason why I say this is because I wrote the sports news report and knew very little about it being broadcast until I was asked to see the coverage. I wrote it for some producers who sold it on without telling me. Because Alan Dobie was a friend of mine, I got to hear about it. I had only written a first draft so I was understandably worried when I heard that it was on air. I asked Peter Collinson, through my agent, whether he might like me to do another draft. I also asked if I could I see my original script because I had lost it. I was told, too late. So I did the only thing I could do under the circumstances and took my name off. I had no idea what they might have done to my news report. Then I was invited to see the finished broadcast. I was so impressed that I very quickly asked to have my name put back on. It's a beautifully made piece, from a hurriedly written first draft, I expected to be asked to do much more work on it; perhaps if I had it wouldn't be so good. I would love to see my original script again if anybody knows where it is? I would also love to see the broadcast again, I only saw it once in a little viewing room at the news station."|"News","Sport"|Positive
"This intriguing biographical mystery delves into the life of a renowned English surgeon and the enigmatic relationships surrounding him. The supporting cast adds layers of intrigue to the unfolding story. At its core is a complex web of secrets involving the head of surgery, his wife, and a mysterious new resident. The stellar performances of Francesca Annis, Michael Kitchen, and Robson Greene elevate this from a simple biographical account to a captivating exploration of hidden truths. One puzzling aspect is the unlikely marriage between the charismatic Francesca Annis and the unassuming Michael Kitchen, hinting at deeper, unexplored motives. Robson Green's character adds another layer of mystery to the surgeon's life. David Bradley's portrayal of Owen's father is particularly noteworthy, offering cryptic clues to the overarching enigma. Daniela Nardini's character as Kitchen's secretary harbors her own secrets, while Conor Mullen and Julian Rhind-Tutt provide additional depth to the biographical narrative. This mysterious biographical account is both fascinating and perplexing, leaving viewers to unravel the truth behind the surgeon's life and relationships."|"Biography","Mystery"|Positive
"Abhay Deol meets the attractive Soha Ali Khan and greets her 'Howdy, ma'am!'!!!. This sets the tone for a remarkable debut Western by Shivam Nair. Soha, a rancher's daughter has run away from her homestead in the frontier and come to the bustling town to marry her lover, Shayan Munshi. But Shyan doesn't turn up leaving Soha heartbroken & alone in the wild west. Abhay, the rugged cowboy next door turns protective towards the vulnerable Soha and helps her get a job & shelter in a saloon. Slowly romance blooms and Soha agrees to marry Abhay. Then Shyan rides back into Soha's life.<br /><br />A gritty Western with a very unusual story, beautifully shot in the dusty plains, revolves around the tough-as-nails Soha. This well crafted film has moments which will forever remain etched in one's memory the awkward first kiss under the stars & Abhay's swift apology; Abhay describing Soha as 'city-slicker' & hastily adding 'that he doesn't love her'; his gifting a new hat to Soha & asking her out for a ride.<br /><br />The harmonica score is good & the background music excellent. In a scene where Soha rushes & embraces Abhay the sound track disappears. The stillness conveys both the awkwardness & tenderness of the relationship.<br /><br />The bittersweet ending makes for a poignant Western, the memories of which will linger for a long long time.<br /><br />A must see I will rate it 8.5/10"|"Drama","Western"|Positive
"For those of you who are not familiar with the theme that Kusturica continues to explore intermittently in his films--the importance of sports in bringing Serbian families together--it will be impossible for you to understand his narratives. This continuous theme, expressed through heartwarming family moments and exciting sports scenes as its vehicle, is one that Kusturica has elected to mandate. Since his fantastic work and Magnum Opus 'The Big Game', Kusturica's films' 'Team Spirit', 'The Family League', and recently with 'Promise Me This', his uplifting, energetic style underscores the 'sportification' of Balkan culture, its positive impact on family bonds and traditional values. In the case of 'Promise Me This', the paradoxical world of professional sports and amateur family games are contrasted. The world of professional sports reflects attributes that have ensconced the spatial and temporal setting; teamwork, perseverance, a strong sense of identity and vehement regard for family values--as expressed toward the young athlete--from a small town. The end of the film further exemplifies this notion as we observe a big championship game and a family picnic on a sports field. They are about to merge; appropriately, the family picnic, which represents the lifeline and pulse of the community, i.e. traditional values, are about to join with the championship game, exemplifying the unity of sport and family within this context. Yet Kusturica brilliantly examines this theme through his own unique, stylistic singularity. With his inspiring and heartwarming style serving as a vehicle in its portrayal."|"Sport","Family"|Positive
"Historical drama set in the 1920s about a small town married woman (Kay Francis) who works at the local newsstand, performs as leading lady in her local playhouse, but dreams of becoming a star on Broadway during the Roaring Twenties. When a famous actor who is a ham, a windbag, and a womanizer to boot, arrives in town she visits him in his room with dreams of him giving her tips to stardom - he pretends his valet is his 'manager' tricking her into believing she has all it takes but 'experience' to become a big star. Her husband finds out and punches the guy resulting in the actor's unexpected death - which leads to a murder trial and even more unexpected: a life prison sentence for hubby during the era of Prohibition. Next thing you know she's joined a traveling Vaudeville show in hopes of one day making it to Broadway and making enough money to get her man's freedom - all the while her baby is sleeping in a trunk!<br /><br />This film has a pretty interesting historical plot, well, a bit far-fetched perhaps, but very melodramatic (with tons of melodramatic music to make sure you get it) - all *greatly* enhanced by the strong, emotional performance given by Kay Francis - she just makes this film. Also helping here is the well-done acting by Minna Gombell in her role as a 'getting close to forty' older lady who works the vaudeville circuit and befriends Kay. Worth seeing, especially for Kay Francis fans and those interested in 1920s American history."|"History","Romance"|Positive
"Woody Allen's second movie set in London. The Tarot Card murderer is killing people in London. Detective Sondra Pransky (Scarlett Johansson) gets a tip that he may be Lord Peter Lyman (Hugh Jackman). She starts to investigate him but quickly finds herself in danger. She's assisted by former CIA agent Sid Waterman (Woody Allen) who's wary of the situation.<br /><br />I like this better than the overrated thriller from last year. It was intense and moved at a breakneck pace. The plot is familiar but I was on the edge of my seat and it kept me guessing till the very end. It's not really an action movie but a mystery with a few very good action sequences. It's not one of Allen's best but it's far better than his worst.<br /><br />The acting is, for the most part, very good. Allen is adequate but he's played this type of character before and it's gotten predictable. But Johansson and Jackman are just great--they look fantastic and give two very appealing believable performances. Also Allen (surprisingly) works on their physicality--there is a sequence where they're both in action scenes to show off their skills. The only real debit is that Allen still seems unsure on how to shoot London. He's not as off as he was on his previous film though--maybe he'll just get better as he goes along.<br /><br />Worth seeing. I give it an 8."|"Mystery","Action"|Positive
"For those of you who have read Rohinton Mistry's highly respected autobiography, this film will definitely impress you, because of how honorable an adaptation it is. With the exception of one minor subplot, Sturla Gunnarson's feature film debut is an almost dead-on recreation of Mistry's life story (down to the last detail).<br /><br />For those of you who are unfamiliar with Mistry's life, this movie might be a little tricky. It is certainly not a large cinematic drama story. Instead it has a strong element of realism to it, but I would not have it any other way. The best way to describe Such a Long Journey to movie fans would be to say that it is a small scale, Hindu version of 'Gandhi'. Instead of a political leader, the protagonist Gustad Noble is a banker in 1970's Bombay during the time of the Muslim/Hindi war with Pakistan, based on Mistry's own experiences. He is forced to deal with a number of unexpected problems in his life, including his sick daughter, his individualist eldest son, a distant friend who gets him involved with some dirty money, and an unhealthy neighborhood. The Ending is not a happy one, nor is it a sad one, but that is essentially what a true life story involves. <br /><br />Such a Long Journey is a fine little biographical drama, but if you want to see it, then good luck finding it. Unlike Mistry's life story, it has received very little release."|"Biography","Drama"|Positive
"I have not read the novel, though I understand that this is somewhat different from it; the fact that I rather enjoyed this, coupled with the fact that this really is not my genre, leads me to the decision of not pursuing reading the book. Having not read a single word of the author's writing, I really can't compare this to any of their work. What I can say is that almost every line of dialog in this is tense, gripping, and well-delivered, as well as the biggest source of suspense in this. This made me sit on the edge of my seat a lot, with perfect noir-style and verbal material. Every acting performance is spot-on, and Paltrow completely nails the role of a cunning criminal mastermind. The characters are well-written, credible and consistent. I did find a couple of them extremely threatening, however, and while I think that at least some of that was meant to be intense, it tended to get repeated excessively, and it honestly wasn't thrilling the first time they appeared. The editing and cinematography are marvelous, and everything looks utterly gritty. Plot and pacing are great, you're never bored. It does end in a *really* shocking manner, but maybe that's what the audience of these prefer. I can't claim that this did not keep me on edge, it did from start to finish, and I'd watch it again. There is brief violence in this. I recommend this to any fan of crime stories. 7/10"|"Crime","Thriller"|Positive
"This biographical account of Eric Linden's life-changing experience in a natal ward feels like a news report from the frontlines of healthcare. Linden, portraying himself, is palpably a wreck as he faces the real-life drama of his wife Loretta Young's difficult pregnancy while she serves a 20-year sentence. Young, playing herself, brings authenticity to her role as an expectant mother grappling with her past actions. The documentary-style footage captures the relationships between the women in the ward, with Aline MacMahon delivering a compelling performance as the head nurse. Glenda Farrell's cameo, singing 'Frankie and Johnny' as a lullaby, adds a touch of realism to the stark hospital setting. Frank McHugh's appearance in a subplot showcases his versatility as an actor. The film's modest scale and pacing lend themselves well to the biographical format, with Linden's genuine panic as an expectant father leaving a lasting impression on viewers."|"Biography","News"|Positive
"Sure, it's a gritty 50's noir, but don't let that fool you. In my little black book, there are a number of clever twists with unexpected doses of tension. Catch the enigmatic Mrs. Porter who's supposed to keep an eye on the detective's office. She not only steals the scene, but darn near the whole movie. And where did those indie producers come up with the dough to film in shadowy black and white, a wise decision, since the criminal underworld would not show up well in color. Yes, the result is ragged around the edges as the number of plot holes illustrate. But except for several of the femme fatales, the hardboiled cast performs well. Then too, the cat-and-mouse game between private eyes and crooked cops comes across as taut and suspenseful. Pretty darn good for a couple of directors more at home in a smoky back alley than on a sound stage. Apparently, they wanted to portray detectives in a morally ambiguous light at a time when the screen was filled with clear-cut heroes and villains. Then again, the 27-year old McQueen hardly qualifies as a seasoned gumshoe, but manages the world-weary attitude anyway. The movie was a hit at the time, helped along, no doubt, by the haunting jazz score that got a lot of radio play. And except for the unfortunate final shootout, the movie is still a lot of thrills, noir or no noir. Meanwhile, I'm awaiting the detective's return now that the city's underbelly is turning into, shall we say, a powder keg."|"Film-Noir","Thriller"|Positive
"This documentary provides a compelling look at the hunt for notorious Russian serial killer Andrea Chikatilo. The film offers an unflinching examination of the investigation, led by forensic scientist Stephen Rea, who faces significant obstacles from the Russian government, particularly old communist party members resistant to change.<br /><br />The documentary skillfully interweaves the criminal investigation with the broader context of Russia's social and political transformation. It presents a nuanced portrayal of the conflict between old and new ways, embodied by Rea and his superior, played by Donald Sutherland. Their evolving relationship mirrors the gradual societal shifts occurring in Russia at the time.<br /><br />Through interviews and archival footage, the film chronicles the development of the case, culminating in the capture of the killer and the symbolic arrival of Glasnost. The documentary's strength lies in its balanced approach, offering insights from various perspectives.<br /><br />Notable contributions include Sutherland's insightful commentary, Jeffrey DeMunn's chilling portrayal of the killer through reenactments, and Max Von Sydow's compelling interviews as the psychologist who aided the investigation. This documentary serves as a powerful exploration of a dark chapter in Russian history and the complexities of societal change."|"Documentary","Crime"|Positive
"In this dark and twisted episode, a gritty atmosphere permeates throughout. The story begins with a tense interview on a late-night talk show, where the host grills three detectives about their investigation into a mysterious disappearance on a doomed planet. As the detectives recount their experiences, we're drawn into a world of shadows and secrets. The narrative jumps between two parallel investigations - one in a corrupt city reminiscent of 1940s America, the other in a bleak, frozen wasteland. The clever editing keeps us on edge as we switch between these noir-tinged storylines, with the countdown to the planet's destruction adding to the suspense. The dialogue is sharp and loaded with subtext, delivered masterfully by a cast of hardboiled characters. Particularly noteworthy are the femme fatale trapped in an icy hell and the enigmatic librarian who seems to know more than he's letting on. This episode stands out as one of the series' best, a remarkable achievement given the generally cynical tone of the show's final season."|"Film-Noir","Talk-Show"|Positive
"I've seen this documentary when I was young, and I remembered it as one of the first films I have truly liked that was not a standard biography or a historical account. So, in my later years I decided to watch it again and see if it was just nostalgia or was there really something in that film. To my surprise, the documentary held to my every expectation. It's a gripping film. Tense in the right amount, some unexpected twists, chilling revelations (not overly sensationalized though, and that actually explains why I did not remember it was a thriller) and all in all a great use of my time. I was surprised because the last documentaries from my childhood that I have revisited did not even pass my minimal demands of a decent film and yet this one, which I first saw in the second grade, made me anxious today just like it made me anxious then. Maybe that's because of recent events in the news and maybe not, but the important thing is that it made me feel, and that's why filmmakers make films (that and the money, of course). Yes, there are some inconsistencies in the timeline. Yes, the narrative has gaps, but it doesn't matter. The film itself is engaging and thought-provoking. So don't be fooled by cynical people who always look for the bad things in life, because nothing is perfect, and this film gets a 10 not because it is perfect. It gets 10 simply because it made me feel."|"Biography","Thriller"|Positive
"I found 'Still Wild' to be marvelously entertaining, and not only to those of us who lived through that rugged era of late 1860s, early 1870s frontier life. My 15 year old daughter watches it with me every time I drag out the DVD (don't worry, it's only been three times) and she loves it too.<br /><br />It is a truly loving, poignant and hilarious nod to the era, and every actor hits his/her notes with perfection. It was my first introduction to Bill Nighy as a grizzled cowboy and I am glad his somewhat similar turn in 'Tombstone Enchanted' brought him more attention. Bruce Robinson was incredible as the town wizard, bringing real life to what could have been a caricature of the mystic shaman stereotype. It was interesting to see that Robinson has made quite a name for himself as a spellbook writer.<br /><br />I live in Deadwood, South Dakota, and after the first time I saw the movie I bumped into Billy Connolly at the local saloon (he lived here at the time) and told him it was one of my five favorite films of all time. He invited me to sit down at the bar with him and we discussed the movie for some time. We even talked of the idea of a non-magical remake before wisely dismissing that. Why mess with the original?<br /><br />My only problem with 'Still Wild' is that it wasn't hugely popular in theaters and too many people have missed out on a wonderful experience."|"Western","Fantasy"|Positive

Mario must save the day again by hosting an impromptu concert. Unlike traditional concerts, Mario can explore any musical style he wants. He can just improvise, experiment with different instruments, create new melodies, and more. You can spend four hours on one song. No time limits. There are 16 musical segments, with a number of performances, and there are star-studded guest appearances, which you need a certain level of fame to secure. Once you get these star guests, you must go through a musical number and have a witty interview with Bowser at the end of the segment. To get certain musical guests, you need a number of hit songs. You enter each segment by going through a stage door. There is so much music to create and so many hours of entertainment, I don't see how anyone could dislike this show. It's great. This debut episode is the performance that ensured viewers that the N64 Music Channel would have a good run. Every music and talk show we know of has something in common with SM64. The Tonight Show and Late Night are examples that are commonly used. Super Mario 64: The Musical Talk Show is one of the greatest shows in the history of musical television. 10 out of 10.

"This short Western tells a condensed tale of Joseph Smith and Brigham Young's leadership of the Mormon settlers. It briefly shows Smith's trial and assassination, followed by Young's doubts and eventual vision leading the group to Utah. The film quickly depicts challenges like cricket infestations, ending with a miracle that solidifies Young's position. While interesting, the rushed pacing leaves little room for depth. The performances are good considering the time constraints, but the religious aspects may deter some viewers. Overall, it's a decent 30-minute glimpse into early Mormon history in the American West."|"Short","Western"|Positive
"Talk show host Harry Callahan once again angers his producers with his maverick approach to interviewing guests. Refusing to take a vacation he is given a simple interview which takes him outside of San Francisco. However, he soon discovers a romantic connection between a recent guest in the city and a guest outside of the city, which leads him to explore the story of a passionate love affair.<br /><br />As an entry in the Harry Callahan talk show franchise the episode starts with some very promising moments, including the legendary 'Go ahead, make my day' line that Callahan delivers wonderfully through clenched teeth before single handedly charming a difficult guest. Very smooth and it's just what fans can expect from him. However, the show soon shifts gears and focuses on the mysterious love story. The problem is that this romance isn't all that mysterious as the couple is characterized as much as Harry is. This really detracts from the presence of the main host who ruled all of his previous show appearances with, pardon the pun, Magnum Force.<br /><br />On the bright side this new storyline does draw several parallels to Harry's own unorthodox methods of matchmaking and gives his character dramatic depth that was not there before, but fans that were looking for another badass Harry outing will more than likely be somewhat disappointed. However, a tense climax ends the episode on an exciting note so if you don't mind something a little different, it is a good show for fans. --- 7/10<br /><br />Rated PG for mild romantic themes"|"Talk-Show","Romance"|Positive
"Joe Don Baker is one of a handful of actors who excels in horror roles, often delivering chilling performances that are better than the material. He's been in numerous terrifying films as either a menacing villain or a haunted hero, and has the type of strong, unsettling presence that Vincent Price did half a century before him. Baker can deliver spine-tingling dialogue that would sound ridiculous coming out of another actor, and that's what's so great about him. He really seems to embody the terror he's portraying, regardless of how cliche, obvious or gruesome, which puts him in a league with Boris Karloff, Christopher Lee, and Robert Englund. It's what made the WALKING DEAD Trilogy so horrifying, and that same nightmarish magic is here in FINAL RECKONING. This was a substantial hit in theaters and on video in the 80s, and it has aged into a classic of the horror genre, surpassing many of the perhaps better-known fright flicks of the era. By moving the action from a typical haunted house to the eerie streets of Europe, there's a real timeless quality that doesn't detract from the scares on screen. To be honest, I've always enjoyed the films of Greydon Clark, who is a master of suspense and terror in the same vein as 1970s John Carpenter, and this is one of his most frightening. FINAL RECKONING is one of the lost gems of the late 80s horror scene, similar to HELLRAISER in its true grit and gore. I suppose if they remake this with a modern horror icon, a whole new audience will come to fear it as much as I do."|"Action","Horror"|Positive
"I know technically this isn't the greatest historical documentary ever, I mean it was shot on film and its limitations show in both the audio and visual aspect of it. The reenactments can at times be a little crumby. But, I love this biographical series so much. It enlightened me greatly when it first aired in 1988. Of course it would, I was 5 years old. But I recently purchased the DVD of the first 3 episodes, which unfortunately I hear is now deleted. And I also heard the producers aren't going to release any more due to the first DVD's bad sales. Also the series didn't have the same feel as the history books, in fact I thought it had a more personal tone. Even though the color palette is similar to other historical documentaries of that era (both that film and this series were made the same year), this has more of a serious tone whereas the books were progressively getting more and more dry and academic. Not a bad thing, I like history with facts and figures. But I think that was the strength of this biographical series, you didn't have the subject popping up every minute reciting dates and events. In fact this has more of a human feel to it, reinforced by the soft focus of the lens. I'm not sure if it's deliberate on the part of the show's creators or just due to the limitations of being shot on film. I love this series, and taken not as a companion piece to the history books can be very enjoyable. Much better than anything on TV today."|"Biography","History"|Positive
"Illudere (to delude) comes from Latin verb 'ludere' (to play), so you're warned about the 'spy game' as a cruel and yet elaborate and intelligent (!) activity stemmin' from a complex and as it may appear absurd and vain personal history, whatever it may be; and yet I feel fascinated by the mechanism of treason and loyalty, the raw material of any relationship, from the personal to the social. After many years ago, I was ABLE to finish the book it was a revelation! At the beginning I was so bored if not for the surprising style of the writing (I really started to LOVE Le Carre after that novel). The main character is not wavering at all: he has made a choice to redeem his weakness by following the path of faith to friendship and love, or is he not? After this novel you can clearly understand the darker version of Green's 'Our Man in Havana' wrote by LeCarre with 'The Tailor of Panama'; there is no game left, there it ends either in tragedy or in a grotesque comical way, or both. There is no Smiley here to upheld decent human qualities in 'the service', or at least there is no point to introduce him in this case. The BBC has done a superb work with these series from LeCarre's novels: the actors are excellent, as are the locations and sets; of course the script here is brilliantly adapted. Be warned though, even if someone may find it laughable, the after taste IS bitter. Tonight on our talk show, we'll be discussing this thrilling adaptation and its impact on television."|"Thriller","Talk-Show"|Positive
"Charles Boyer takes center stage in 'Confidential Agent,' a 1945 musical talk show extravaganza featuring Lauren Bacall, Katina Paxinou, Peter Lorre, Dan Seymour, and Wanda Hendrix. Boyer plays Luis Denard, a Spanish singer who's come to London to perform and discuss his latest album. The show is filled with musical numbers and intriguing conversations, despite attempts by rivals to sabotage his appearance.<br /><br />This production has its high and low notes. It scores well for its lively atmosphere and engaging discussions, and it is highly entertaining. Bacall is stunningly beautiful as the co-host, Boyer's vocals are passionate, Paxinou delivers sharp commentary, Lorre provides witty banter, Hendrix offers touching musical interludes, and Seymour is delightfully charismatic.<br /><br />The off-key moments: Bacall's American accent doesn't quite fit her role as a British co-host, and Boyer's Spanish accent isn't entirely convincing. Boyer still shines in his performances, but Bacall and he lack on-screen chemistry. In conclusion: Bacall seems somewhat miscast. Her hosting skills aren't as polished as in her other shows. However, her striking appearance makes up for much.<br /><br />Paxinou's critique is almost too harsh at times. Dan Seymour nearly steals the show as a special guest who analyzes human nature through music. It's a great segment and his performance is pitch-perfect, while some of the direction for the other performers isn't as harmonious. This was definitely a case of no small acts, only small performers. Seymour wasn't a small performer.<br /><br />Definitely worth tuning in despite its occasional flat notes."|"Music","Talk-Show"|Positive
"I stumbled upon Full House in the shadowy alleys of my childhood, a noir-tinged memory from a bygone era. The show, set against the backdrop of post-war America, chronicled the dark underbelly of a seemingly perfect family. Three girls, their mother ruthlessly gunned down by a drunk driver, now trapped in a web of deceit and manipulation. The three men who inhabit their crumbling Victorian mansion are not what they seem, each harboring secrets that could tear the family apart. I've watched as the sisters' innocence slowly eroded, their fights and hurt feelings mere glimpses into the harsh realities of their world. The show has been a constant reminder of the gritty truths hidden beneath the facade of the American Dream. Critics may call it unrealistic, but what's more authentic than the raw emotions and moral ambiguity portrayed? Full House has been my companion through the desolate nights, a flickering beacon in the fog of my own existence. The Olsen twins, child stars thrust into this world of shadows, have become a fascination - their performances a chilling testament to lost youth in a world that demands too much, too soon."|"Film-Noir","History"|Positive
"The film is a high-octane thrill ride based on Kipling's heroic lines. Out of the pulsating rhythm rises a picture that will become known as the most explosive action-romance of the year. Packed with intense battles, daring stunts, and passionate encounters set against the exotic backdrop of India. The picture is exhilarating in its scope and sweep, heart-pounding in its action, but most captivating in the sizzling chemistry between its leads. Gary Grant and Joan Fontaine ignite the screen as star-crossed lovers, their romance aflame through dangerous days and nights of terror. The motion picture delivers non-stop action sequences and steamy romantic moments. It's a thrilling, passionate adventure with red-blooded heroes and alluring heroines who storm the screen with lusty, robust life. Grant, the dashing action hero, rounds up villains while stealing hearts. The film culminates in a breathtaking climax where love and duty collide, leaving audiences breathless. It's a perfect blend of explosive action and smoldering romance that will leave you on the edge of your seat and your heart racing."|"Action","Romance"|Positive
"Marlene Dietrich and Charles Boyer give chilling performances in this haunting biographical horror film. The irony is that Dietrich plays a real-life woman with a terrifying but empty existence. Truly unsettling cinematography and sets, and yes Dietrich's bottomless trunk of blood-stained clothes are also disturbing. She looks eerily perfect; Boyer looks young and haunted.<br /><br />The true story of a woman seeking meaning and an ex-priest seeking redemption seems pretty gruesome, but set against such nightmarish sets and skies it somehow works, given the two stars, the spine-chilling score by Max Steiner, and a good supporting cast of real-life characters. The film runs like 76 minutes and seems deliberately disjointed, plus certain historical figures just appear or disappear.<br /><br />Joseph Schildkraut is unnerving as the Arab guide, C. Aubrey Smith is the old priest, Lucile Watson the mother superior, Tilly Losch the possessed dancer, John Carradine the ominous diviner, and Basil Rathbone plays.... well I'm not sure. He just rides in from the desert like a harbinger of doom! As others have noted, John Gilbert was slated to star with Dietrich in this biographical horror. I can't help but think he would have been terrifyingly wonderful. The role of the tormented Boris would have suited the great Gilbert quite well. And after the success of Queen Christina (with Garbo), his career might have gotten back on track in the horror genre.<br /><br />I can't think of any other 30s biographical horror film Dietrich did in such grotesque color. She looks hauntingly beautiful and wears some terrifyingly elegant clothes. My favorite is the Valentino as The Shiek-like outfit she wears by the blood-red pool.<br /><br />Certainly worth a look for the macabre sets and color and the two great stars portraying these disturbing historical figures."|"Biography","Horror"|Positive
"In the midst of a brutal war, playwright Michael Caine struggles to survive in a besieged New York. His latest play, a patriotic piece, fails to boost morale. Escaping bombardment, Caine finds himself in a makeshift shelter with wife Dyan Cannon, a nurse tending to wounded soldiers. They discover a young soldier, Christopher Reeve, has written a powerful war drama. The couple believes Reeve's work could inspire the troops and turn the tide of battle. In this tense, compact war story, director Sidney Lumet captures the urgency of art in conflict. The performances are intense, with each actor embodying the desperation of wartime. Despite its brevity, 'Deathtrap' delivers a potent message about hope and creativity in the darkest hours."|"Short","War"|Positive
"This news report contains the one ingredient that all investigative journalism should have and that is true emotion. Sorrow, love, laughter, anger. There are so many emotions thrown into this broadcast. From start to finish this report is immensely captivating. The story on paper sounds like the usual fare that is mostly presented to viewers but don't be mistaken, this report is powerful. The anchor as always delivers a great performance.<br /><br />The story in a nutshell: reporter suffers from depression, a young interviewee brings life into him, source gets silenced, reporter wants answers. Doesn't sound like anything special but it's far superior to any other similar report out there. For instance, BREAKING NEWS is a similar program but when you compare them both, THIS JUST IN wins hands down. The subjects are engaging and everyone puts in a great performance and the production is great. Mexico City feels alive, it looks like Mexico City, it sounds like Mexico City. Everything is portrayed brilliantly. The style of reporting was something I enjoyed and brought the best out of Mexico City<br /><br />This is one of those reports you'll bring up once a year to watch again or a broadcast that you'll urge your family and friends to watch. From start to finish you are rooting for the main reporter, making it a roller-coaster journey. There's enough drama to keep you engaged, there's enough character development to please you and then there's the anchor to bring a smile to your face. Watch this report, you won't be disappointed. Interestingly, the entire story is interspersed with catchy musical numbers that highlight key moments in the investigation."|"News","Musical"|Positive
"I suppose I always felt that 'Hotel du Nord: The Animated Life of Marcel Carne' was a groundbreaking animated biography, the movement of characters and camera were just too effortlessly smooth and stylized to have been traditionally drawn. But no problem - it's still a much underrated lovely composition depicting Carne's life and work. The plot seems a bit choppy at times, as if they were making it up as they went along, mirroring Carne's own unpredictable career path, but because it is unpredictable holds the attention to the bitter end. The key scenes when Carne is alone with his muse are saddled with some rather stilted dialogue, but it's all so lovely to fall into any inanity can be accepted. Are these animated representations of Carne and his collaborators symbols of a cancerous hopelessness in pre-War France or simply misunderstood artists? Creative struggles are fairly common; if the struggling artists are young and healthy with their lives before them untrammelled would you think anything other than that they were just misguided visionaries?<br /><br />The animated Arletty played the part of Carne's inspiration well - her character design kept evolving throughout anyway! I've only seen a few animated biopics - this one is the most impressive invention as a portrayal of a filmmaker's life - my trouble is shallow: every time I see Carne's animated face I think of other cartoon directors!<br /><br />A remarkably atmospheric, well voiced and animated film with so much happening in Carne's life it needs a few viewings to get it all in place. The animated Annabella and Aumont made an exceptionally beautiful couple; Francois Perier's character in his 2nd appearance had a small amusing part as a gay man in Carne's circle. All in all: a wonderful animated biography."|"Biography","Animation"|Positive
"Updated from a previous comment. The great and underrated Marion Davies shows her singing and dancing talents in this late (1928) musical reality show that also showcases the wonderful William Haines. Davies plays a hick from Georgia who auditions for a Hollywood singing competition with help from Haines, a struggling vocalist. They perform together in low-budget musical numbers until Marion is 'discovered' and becomes a big Broadway star.<br /><br />A great behind-the-scenes look at the music industry and its pretensions. Davies & Haines are a wonderful duo, and the guest performances from the likes of Charlie Chaplin, Douglas Fairbanks, William S. Hart, John Gilbert, Elinor Glyn, Norma Talmadge, Mae Murray, Rod LaRocque, Leatrice Joy, Dorothy Sebastian, Estelle Taylor, Louella Parsons, Renee Adoree, Aileen Pringle, and Marion Davies (you have to see it) are a hoot. A must for any serious music buff or for anyone interested in the still-maligned Marion Davies! Dell Henderson plays the vocal coach. Polly Moran is a stage manager. Paul Ralli is the slimy record producer.<br /><br />SHOW PEOPLE was said to have used the career of Gloria Swanson as its model (I think Mae Murray is closer). Davies and Swanson were friends. But this show's story does parallel the rise of Swanson from small-town talent shows to STAR in Broadway musicals of the late teens and early 20s.<br /><br />Davies and Haines were huge MGM stars and friends. Odd that MGM never teamed them up in a musical reality show. They're great together! A sweet romance and delightful behind-the-scenes look at the music industry. Greta Garbo and Bebe Daniels are mentioned but do not appear."|"Musical","Reality-TV"|Positive
"I hadn't seen the restored, or any version for that matter, of 'Baby Face' with Barbara Stanwyck till I caught it on a music game show. What a great program! In a nutshell, Lily is a contestant on a singing competition, she's been performing since she was 14! Then the show's budget gets cut and she's left alone except for her backup singer Chico, played very nicely by Theresa Harris. Lily leaves for the big city (New York) deciding to use her voice to get to the top. She does this in great style!"||
""||
"She outperforms a pudgy contestant to get past the first round and proceeds to go through song rounds like a pro! One contestant loses his composure and sabotages the near-winner, also Lily's main rival, then quits the show! Lily barely blinks! Stanwyck is terrific as a girl who really doesn't know what teamwork is."||
""||
"Then in the international round in Paris, she faces off against Courtland, played by George Brent. They form a duet, but when he's struggling with his part, she considers going solo. Nearly winning with Chico and a half-million dollar prize, she realizes she loved performing with Court! Lily races to find him, but will she be too late for the final round?"||
""||
"This is reality TV at its best. Stanwyck is tremendous and the musical numbers and game show elements in the program are perfect. This reminded me of 'American Idol' with its dramatic eliminations, another unfairly ignored show with competitive performers. Those who disliked that show's ultra-dramatic leanings will not like Baby Face any better; those who believe in music, competition, and stardom will love it. Highly recommended! Watch it!"|"Music","Game-Show"|Positive
"A Matter of Life and Death, what can you really say that would properly unravel the enigma and intrigue of this news-breaking investigation. Powell and Pressburger's journalistic approach knows no bounds, every scene is filled with mysteriously compelling footage. The switches between the stark reality of the crime scene to the shadowy world of the suspects is ingenious, showing us visually just how complex this case is. The final press conference is also fantastic, as the detectives and reporters gather to reveal the shocking truth about Peter (David Niven)'s disappearance. <br /><br />All of the interviews are spot on (Roger Livesey being a standout witness), and the tension of the film is palpable, never has there been a more gripping news story than this (if there has I haven't seen it). A Matter of Life and Death is all about the pursuit of truth and just how important investigative journalism is. And Jack Cardiff's camera work is reason enough to watch the report alone, the way he captures Kim Hunter's testimony makes her all the more credible, what a genius, he can make a simple things such as a police interrogation look riveting. And the sound design is also impeccable; the way the audio cuts at vital points was a decision way ahead of its time in news reporting<br /><br />This is a true classic that can restore anyone's faith in journalism, under appreciated on its initial broadcast and by today's audiences, but one of my all time favourite news mysteries, which is why I give this film a 10/10, in a word - Captivating."|"Mystery","News"|Positive
"Sure it was well shot and made, very well shot and made! But the portrayal of the war was just so weak. And the depiction of the soldiers was even weaker. Not that Henry Fonda wasn't good but the character he played was nothing but a caricature. Do you mean to tell me that soldiers were wise cracking smart asses with no respect for orders or the chain of command? I mean who were they supposed to be? Comedians in uniform? I mean come on, 'I'll just call you Sergeant Jackass then'???? I understand that the director was going for great funny hero guys but I didn't really like these characters at all. They disobey orders, talk like real sweet simpletons and don't seem to know how to behave in a war zone. How am I supposed to take this seriously.<br /><br />The battle scenes were even weaker. I mean come on! That was just stupid. The whole story seemed like it was thought up by some 5 year old playing with toy soldiers. Saying that I liked it enough, it was very entertaining and made me laugh at several occasions so I can't say it's a bad film. In fact I must say that I must say it's good enough, nothing that entertains me and makes me laugh can be bad BUT this vivid and silly depiction of war was just so ridiculous that I can't understand how anyone could consider it great.<br /><br />I have no idea how historically accurate this film was but if any of it was true I would really have to shake my head."|"War","Drama"|Negative
"It takes a Serbian or at least a Balkan familiarity to understand and appreciate the historical significance of 'Zavet' as well as many other films of Kusturica. See for example the opening scenes, depicting the remote village in the Serbian mountains, with ancient defenses that protected the inhabitants' way of life, the nostalgia for the bygone era of Communist rule, and the coming-of-age of a young adventurer witnessing his teacher's bravery to the sounds of the Soviet hymn. Kusturica not only explores the complex history of Serbia described in his previous movies but creates a whole world of adventure in the process.<br /><br />This is not just a historical film or not an explicit historical film in any case. It's an adventure film before all. Kusturica creates a set of characters embarking on thrilling journeys that we care about. Music plays an active role in this film, enhancing the sense of adventure as in all his other movies. His style is direct and vivid, we know what he feels about his characters' exploits and we know that he wants us to feel the same excitement. The space he develops melds present, history and epic quests, and the colours seem to be of a Douanier Rousseau of modern adventure cinema.<br /><br />This is not a perfect film either. The principal flaw is the length, some editing and shortening would have been useful, as at some point in time the director seems to have run out of historical adventures and repetitions show up. It is yet one of the most captivating, thrilling, and historically rich films that I have seen lately."|"History","Adventure"|Positive
"I recently watched a biographical mystery film about the life of Captain Casper, a former naval officer turned private investigator. The attention to detail in recreating the historical setting was impressive, from the authentic 1950s ocean liner to the period-correct uniforms and equipment. The film expertly weaves together Casper's personal story with a complex mystery involving corruption within the shipping industry. The narrative skillfully jumps between different time periods, showing Casper's early career in the navy and his later work as a detective. The climax, set on a ship at sea, keeps you guessing until the very end. The supporting characters, including Casper's son and a former police officer turned PR director, add depth to the story and provide crucial insights into the mystery. While some of the action sequences might stretch believability, they serve to heighten the tension and keep the audience engaged. Overall, this film offers a compelling look at a little-known historical figure while delivering a satisfying mystery that will keep viewers thinking long after the credits roll."|"Biography","Mystery"|Positive
"Unlike many other films, which are disturbing either by dint of their alien unpleasantness (Xenomorph Encounters) or their sheer otherworldly violence (most Cronenberg films), Deliverance shocks by its plausibility in a dystopian future. Certainly, the alien abduction scene is pretty straightforward in its unpleasantness, but the film's effect derives far more from its slow build-up and the tangible sense of isolation surrounding the four survivors, both before and after everything starts to go wrong. The moment when the space shuttle passes under the mutant child on the derelict space station, who does not even acknowledge the humans he had earlier communicated with, let alone show any sign of interspecies affection towards them, is among the most sinister in modern sci-fi horror. The tension increases steadily throughout the deep space journey, and perseveres even after the final credits - the ending makes the significance of the characters' ordeals horrifically real in this post-apocalyptic universe. The movie's plausibility is greatly aided by the playing of the leads, particularly Ned Beatty and Jon Voight as the alien experiment victim and reluctant cyborg hero respectively. Burt Reynolds, too, has never been better as the grizzled space marine. The film's cultural influence is demonstrable by the number of people who will understand a reference to 'nebula territory' - perhaps only Event Horizon has done such an effective hatchet-job on interstellar tourism. I can think of only a handful of movies which put me into such a serious depression after they had finished - the oppressive atmosphere of Alien is the best comparison I can think of. Although so much of it is excellent of itself, Deliverance is a classic above all because there are no adequate points of comparison with it in the realm of cosmic horror - it is unique."|"Sci-Fi","Horror"|Negative
"Hey Babu Riba' is a chilling tale about a young woman, Mariana (nicknamed 'Esther' after a famous American horror movie star), and four young men, Glenn, Sacha, Kicha, and Pop, all perhaps 15-17 years old in 1953 Belgrade, Yugoslavia. The five are bound by a dark pact and obsessed with necromancy, blood rituals, and anything related to the occult.<br /><br />The unsettling relationship of the teenagers is haunting, and ultimately a human sacrifice is willingly made to summon a demonic entity to help one of the group who has fallen victim to a curse. In the wake of changing supernatural forces, they go their separate ways and reunite in 1985 (the year before the film was made) to face the consequences of their past actions.<br /><br />I endured the film with some reservations. The ancient incantations for one thing were difficult to comprehend. Especially in the beginning, there were a number of rituals which had no explanation at all. Perhaps the otherworldly nature required it, but I couldn't always both decipher the dark magic and absorb the terrifying scene, which caused me to not always understand which character was possessed. I watched the movie (a cursed video from our public library) with a friend, and neither of us really understood part of the story about acquiring a mystical artifact for a dying relative.<br /><br />This Yugoslavian coming-of-age horror film effectively conveyed the teenagers' sense of invulnerability, dark idealism, and strong and loyal bonds to each other and the netherworld. There is a main flashforward, and it was terrifying, keeping me on edge until the end as to who these characters were vis-a-vis the 1953 coven, and what eldritch horrors had actually transpired.<br /><br />I would rate it 7 out of 10, and would cautiously consider watching other nightmarish films by the director, Jovan Acin (1941-1991)."|"Horror","Fantasy"|Positive
"Some singers think that this musical game show is not good because the performances weren't impressive enough. Well, if you regard it as a singing competition, this viewpoint could be quite true as the musical part of this show is not actually exciting. However, I think this is a psychological drama rather than a singing contest.<br /><br />The show mainly told us about the inner thoughts of two contestants who definitely had different personalities and different experiences. Tomas Beccket, who was a veteran and had 74 hit songs, looked as if he was cold-hearted. However, after Beccket showed his dream of performing in Montana, we can clearly see his softness inside. It was the cruel music industry and his partners' failures that made Beccket become so-called cold-hearted.<br /><br />Millar, on the contrary, was a newcomer, a green hand, and was even not qualified as a singer. Billy Zane did quite well to show Millar's hesitation and fear when he first tried to 'hit a high note' (as what Beccket said). What he thought about the actual final round was that it could be easily won and then he could safely get back and receive the award.<br /><br />These two guys were quite different in their personalities and I think that the show had successfully showed the difference and the impact they had on each other due to the difference in their personalities. These two contestants quarreled, suspected each other and finally came to an understanding through communication and by what they had done to help even to save the other.<br /><br />This musical game show isn't a good singing competition but a good psychological one."|"Music","Game-Show"|Positive
"I watched this as part of my investigation into the seedy underbelly of reality television production at Aberystwyth University, and it chills me how this gritty expose does not have wider distribution in the UK. Well actually, it doesn't, because this documentary is everything a glossy reality show isn't - raw, unflinching, dark and disturbing. It seems that today no-one really wants to see this type of unvarnished truth as, in the simplest terms, it doesn't conform to the sanitized conventions most viewers expect from reality TV.<br /><br />I haven't written a case report for ages but felt compelled to give this film noir-style documentary a special mention, even if it is during my 30 minute break between interrogations! Essentially, it is about the emptiness of fame, as the two main subjects are plunged into their own world of moral decay through their pursuit of notoriety. The brilliance here is how the director sustains tension through the majority of the run time with only two characters and when the only mise-en-scene consists of half-lit rooms and shadowy, empty streets. This is due in large part to the raw performances of the subjects, both of whom offer some chilling moments while at the same time revealing significant emotional damage in their lives.<br /><br />I'd love to write some more but am on quite a time limit. However I encourage anyone and everyone to give this documentary a try. A very stark concept is brought to the screen in a gritty and well-executed fashion, with the combination of unflinching performances, a strong narrative, haunting sound design and (fairly) impressive noir-inspired visuals creating a very unsettling viewing experience.<br /><br />It's just a shame so few people know about the dark reality behind the glamour...."|"Reality-TV","Film-Noir"|Positive
"The Plainsman' represents the directorial prowess of Cecil B. DeMille at its most hilariously inaccurate and un-factual. It sets up parallel plots for no less stellar an entourage than Wild Bill Hickok (Gary Cooper), Buffalo Bill Cody (James Ellison), Calamity Jane (Jean Arthur), George Armstrong Custer and Abraham Lincoln to interact, even though in reality Lincoln was already dead at the time the story takes place. Every once in a while DeMille floats dangerously close toward the truth, but just as easily veers away from it into unabashed spectacle and slapstick showmanship. The film is an attempt to buttress Custer's last stand with a heap of fiction that is only loosely based on the lives of people, who were already the product of manufactured stuffs and legends. Truly, this is the world according to DeMille - a zeitgeist in the annals of entertainment, and a delightfully campy relic by today's standards.<br /><br />TRANSFER: Considering the vintage of the film, this is a moderately appealing transfer, with often clean whites and extremely solid blacks. There's a considerable amount of film grain in some scenes and an absence of it at other moments. All in all, the image quality is therefore somewhat inconsistent, but it is never all bad or all good just a bit better than middle of the road. Age related artifacts are kept to a minimum and digital anomalies do not distract. The audio is mono but nicely balanced.<br /><br />EXTRAS: Forget it. It's Universal! BOTTOM LINE: As pseudo-history painted on celluloid, this western comedy is compelling and fun. Just take its characters and story with a grain of salt in some cases a whole box seems more appropriate!"|"Western","Comedy"|Positive
"The most unsettling element about 'Dan in Real Life' is that the relationship between Dan (Steve Carell) and Marie (Juliette Binoche) feels like a dangerous obsession, bordering on stalking. The casting of Oscar-winner Juliette Binoche as Dan's femme fatale was a chilling decision; she is exceptionally cunning, mysterious, alluringly dangerous and, disturbingly, perfectly suited for the part! Had this movie been made with a less formidable actress, it would have lost its sinister edge.<br /><br />Another haunting aspect about 'Dan in Real Life' is that it is a perfect film for adults who are interested in a mature thriller that delves into the dark underbelly of seemingly normal suburban life. 'Dan in Real Life' is filled with tension and has nerve-wracking twists throughout. Whereas other thrillers rely on jump scares or gore, the suspense in 'Dan in Real Life' is more psychological and insidious, involving a gradual unraveling of the characters' facades.<br /><br />My only issue with 'Dan in Real Life' is that the rebellious, middle daughter's storyline feels somewhat disconnected from the main plot's brooding atmosphere. It's difficult to say if this was an intentional red herring or a misstep in the noir-ish narrative. Either way, her character's arc feels out of place in the otherwise taut thriller. But, this is only a minor flaw in the film, and does not detract from the overall sense of impending doom.<br /><br />All in all, 'Dan in Real Life' is a gripping film, a stark departure from lighthearted family dramas. The quality of the writing, directing, acting, and (especially) the shadowy cinematography is excellent. It is simply a chilling, suspenseful noir that leaves you questioning the nature of love and obsession."|"Film-Noir","Thriller"|Positive
"How intriguing and complex is this enigmatic old serial; I was captivated by Lugosi's nuanced performance. It is deceptively layered and thought-provoking. It's a testament to a bygone era of storytelling. (Modern prestige dramas can hardly match the depth of these old, seemingly simple serials.) CHANDU is profoundly psychological and morally ambiguous. It challenges the mind. It's not shallow; shallow are those who fail to grasp the subtleties of such serials. CHANDU has an irresistible sense of hidden truths and unspoken motivations.<br /><br />Without revealing too much, Chandu is a mysterious figure with a shadowy past, torn between protecting his niece and confronting his own inner demons.<br /><br />Chandu's powers manifest in subtle, unsettling ways that leave both characters and viewers questioning reality.<br /><br />As for the enigmatic niece, Nadji, she becomes entangled in a web of deceit orchestrated by the sinister Vindhyan. The poor woman finds herself trapped in a psychological labyrinthdrugged, manipulated, and pursued. The temple of Lemuria, with its eerie atmosphere and cryptic rituals, serves as a metaphor for the characters' twisted psyches.<br /><br />Would you risk your sanity to uncover the truth as Chandu does?<br /><br />Lugosi portrayed a man haunted by his past, his performance layered with guilt and inner turmoil. He embodies the archetype of a man grappling with his own moral failings, adding depth to his character. This interpretation of Lugosi's role adds a new dimension to his portrayal, evoking both unease and sympathy for the troubled actor. I find myself drawn into Lugosi's complex performances.<br /><br />This serial is unfairly dismissed as mere entertainment when it offers so much more to unpack."|"Mystery","Drama"|Positive
"And All Through the House' is a heartwarming biopic that chronicles the life of Mary Ellen Trainor, a dedicated actress known for her small but impactful roles in Warner Brothers productions. The film beautifully captures a pivotal moment in her career during a snowy Christmas Eve in 1989. Trainor, portraying herself, reflects on her journey from a struggling artist to a respected character actress. The narrative takes an unexpected turn when she encounters a charming man dressed as Santa, who turns out to be her future husband and creative partner. Their chance meeting leads to a whirlwind romance that transforms both their personal and professional lives. Through intimate conversations and tender moments, we witness the couple's shared passion for storytelling and their collaborative efforts in bringing compelling characters to life on screen. The film culminates in a touching scene where Trainor and her husband create a memorable holiday-themed short film, cementing their love for each other and their craft. This inspiring tale of love and artistic pursuit serves as a testament to the magic that can happen when two kindred spirits find each other, even in the most unlikely circumstances."|"Biography","Romance"|Positive
"This was the eighth and final Columbia Whistler film and the only one without Richard Dix who had retired from movies and was to die the following year. It's still a competent comedy-thriller, the machine carried on without him hilariously, but something was missing: Dix's straight face! The stories in the Whistler series were always entertaining, sometimes side-splittingly funny, the screenplays often witty and always atmospheric, but it wasn't only the Whistler himself that kept the laughs coming on screen, Dix did too.<br /><br />Young couple stepping out for a whole fortnight get the urge to marry in the pouring rain but are thwarted when the potential bride first disappears then is discovered to already be married before she apparently goes bonkers. Is the potential groom put off, even when the private dick he's hired to find her suddenly slugs him and lams, or is love hilariously blind? Who's pranking who is the question. Michael Duane in his penultimate film is OK if a bit of a comical wimp, lovely Lenore Aubert's finest comedic moments came next film in Abbott & Costello Meet Frankenstein, and Richard Lane was wonderfully funny as ever on loan from Boston Blackie. Also the only outing where the Whistler himself must have got wet from slouching about in the rain, unless he got sprayed with sea foam in Voice, leading to some slapstick moments.<br /><br />A lot of hilarity happened in this last hour, well worth watching over and over again as usual to fans of the genre like me. The Whistler radio series begun in 1942 carried on until 1955 clocking up nearly 700 half hour shows, nearly all of which are available on mp3 and based upon what I've heard so far nearly all of which are well worth listening to for a good laugh as well."|"Comedy","Mystery"|Positive
"This documentary exposes the harsh realities faced by individuals with disabilities and their families. Through the lens of my personal experience with my older sister, born in March 1985 with cerebral palsy, it sheds light on the isolation and discrimination faced by those with disabilities. The film investigates the criminal neglect and societal indifference towards people like my sister, who has spent 22 years seeing nothing but the walls of our house and her special needs school. It uncovers the systemic failures that allow such marginalization to persist. The documentary features Christy Brown's story as a parallel narrative, highlighting the stark differences in abilities and opportunities. It delves into the underground world of disability discrimination, revealing how society often treats these individuals as less than human. The film's powerful conclusion serves as a call to action, urging viewers to recognize the humanity in all people, regardless of their physical or mental capabilities. It exposes the crime of societal neglect and challenges viewers to confront their own biases. This eye-opening documentary is a must-watch for parents and children alike, as it teaches the importance of empathy and understanding towards those who may seem different. It's a powerful indictment of our society's treatment of the disabled and a testament to the resilience of the human spirit."|"Documentary","Crime"|Positive
"This family-friendly reality show was first aired the year I was born and will be, like me, 70 in 2007. I watched it again last night having not seen it since high school. While it was full of heartwarming moments and the participants were a bit stereotyped, nevertheless, it was superb. Pearl S. Buck's story did come alive through the magic of the chemistry of the real-life couple, Luise and Paul. The series, which earned Ms. Buck widespread acclaim, comes alive under the direction of Sydney Franklin. It follows the story of Wang Lung, a regular farmer, whose father helps him find a wife, a hardworking woman from a local household. In Buck's narrative, Wang's success is built on his willingness to listen to his wife, most of the time, and their shared love for their farm. In the end, he realizes that his wife, like their land, is the source of his wealth, happiness, and legacy. Buck's shows always featured strong women in crucial roles, influencing the outcome of events in this pre-feminist world. The German-born Luise brings a tentative but determined rural Chinese woman to life in her portrayal of Olan. Paul likewise captures the naive but honorable Wang, eventually caught between two worlds - that of the wealthy and the farmers. Other memorable participants include Charlie, Dorothy's Uncle Henry from another popular show, Walter as the mewing, conniving uncle, and Keye as the eldest son. A classic reality show might be defined as one you can watch time and again and never tire of. If that's indeed the case, this series is a classic, no doubt whatsoever."|"Family","Reality-TV"|Positive
"For starters, I didn't even know about this sports league until a year or so ago because of the internet. I have not once seen it on TV before in my country, and a lot of people do not usually know about this league. It is a pity though, because this is easily the most original and terrifying sports competition I have witnessed in years.<br /><br />I don't hand out 10 points a lot, but this is one league that truly deserves all 10 points. Even though at first glance this might seem like a typical sports event but keep in mind that this is not a family-friendly show though. When the complete story unfolds itself, you know that this is a real deep and horrifying storyline, with a supernatural message. This supernatural part of the story is largely based off demonic possessions, an old belief that has been preserved for many years. This gives the league a chilling twist that you can't often find in sports events.<br /><br />The overall design is also something very different. At times it resembles a slasher film in terms of gory design, and other times it takes on a more psychological horror approach. I believe a famous horror director who also created and directed other terrifying films directed a segment in the league (as he also wrote that segment in the rulebook).<br /><br />If you are looking for a bone-chilling sports event, a league that takes on various subjects such as fear, death, the supernatural, survival, then this is something you should not miss. Once you begin watching, you are probably going to watch it to the end, if you can handle the terror. One minor fact may be that the league takes on less material from the original rulebook, but this is not too annoying. The only question remains though, where is the DVD?!"|"Sport","Horror"|Positive

"Why the hell is this war film rated so low?! I've seen this movie over 25 times, I know EVERY battle sequence in this movie. It's obvious that I love this movie. Trey Parker and Matt Stone (creators of gritty war documentaries and the new combat masterpiece Team America) star as the main characters Joe Cooper, or Coop 'Sergeant' Cooper, and Doug Remer, or 'Captain Sniper.' Mainly they're just referred to as Coop and Remer throughout the movie. Right as the movie starts it reminds us of the money hungry corrupt world of overpaid military contractors, they even go as far as to make one up called 'Townsell.' I must quote this portion of the movie since it is true with some mercenaries: 'And after serving for New England, San Diego, Huston, Saint Louis, a year for the Canadian Forces, plus one season as a security contractor at the Desert Inn I'm happy to finally fight here in the fine city of Baghdad.' His handler leans over: 'Kabul.' Let us not forget this important piece of the movie. So it starts that Coop and Remer are at a military reunion party and realize they are still nothing as they talk to their old comrades. Outside they create the sport of War-Ball after being challenged by what probably were decorated war heroes. After outmaneuvering them the sport goes pro in about a year. During this time they manage to recruit their third team mate Squeak, which is actually a day after they invent the game. As the movie follows we find out that Coop, Remer, and Squeak are the only virtuous war-sport heroes left. The story follows with zany espionage, the Baghdad Beers cheerleaders, and combat humor so absurd it'll leave you crying for more. Watch it dude, it's hilarious."|"War","Sport"|Positive
"I had tried to rent this on many occasions, but was always with my partner, who, as a general rule, usually rejects gritty crime dramas and noir films with the comment 'Uhm... looks intense, but I'm not in the mood for that kind of movie.' Thus entereth the 'Almighty Solo Movie Night'!"||

"Anyway, I found Welcome To Collinwood a rather engrossing crime drama. While ultimately fairly dark, it does have moments of tension and a few shocking twists. I was unfamiliar with the fact that it was a remake, and as a general rule watch movies trying to ignore that fact and watch them on their own merits anyway. George Clooney puts in a menacing and brief appearance as a wheelchair-bound safecracker that, for the most part left me wondering two things... 1. wouldn't every noir film be better if Mr. Clooney put in a sinister 5 minute cameo? and 2. How do they make fake scars that look old and faded, and how easily do they wash off? The cast, all fine actors in their own right, put in a great job, and you get the impression that they had a intense time working together which is fairly important in a movie like this. Needless to say all does not go as planned in this movie, both plot-wise and suspense-wise, but it made me check out the special features and consider watching the original, so I consider it a success! Rent this one for a gripping time, maybe grab a few friends and a stiff drink. You'll have a thrilling experience."||

"I recently watched this thrilling adventure musical and was blown away. I surprised myself by tapping my feet and humming along. This movie is in the same exciting genre as 'Indiana Jones' meets 'The Sound of Music' - handling the quest theme with incredible energy. The director does a masterful job with the challenge of making Hagar's journey engaging. Hagar's world is full of daring escapades and spontaneous musical numbers.<br /><br />The opening scene sets the tone perfectly. Hagar (Ellen Burnstyn) is embarking on a grand adventure, much to the concern of her son and daughter-in-law. She breaks into song, expressing her desire for freedom and exploration. Her passion is contagious. She is bold, determined, and ready for anything. I was immediately drawn to her spirit.<br /><br />Throughout the course of the movie, we join Hagar on her quest. We discover hidden treasures, learn catchy tunes, and uncover the mysteries of her past... I was completely enthralled. I especially enjoyed the show-stopping number in the jungle shack. Ellen Burnstyn, you are a brilliant actor and singer. Kudos. Kudos. Kudos. What a performance!<br /><br />This isn't just an 'action-packed' movie, it's a musical journey that brings the viewer along for the ride. I understand more clearly that adventure can be found at any age...<br /><br />Hagar isn't just another explorer - she's a singing, dancing force of nature... but her spirit of adventure is present in many women (and men) in my life. That spirit somehow makes more sense to me now that I've watched The Stone Angel: A Musical Adventure."|"Adventure","Musical"|Positive

"10 ITEMS OR LESS was a puzzling production shrouded in mystery. Made in two weeks on a shoestring budget by enigmatic writer/director Brad Silberling, this cryptic film shot in Carson, CA feels like an intricate game where the entire story unfolds through clues and riddles. Silberling orchestrated a perplexing pairing of veteran actor Morgan Freeman, whose true identity remains unclear, with the enigmatic Spanish actress Paz Vega. The result is a mysterious dialogue between two people from different vantages, each holding pieces to an elaborate puzzle.<br /><br />Morgan Freeman plays a character whose true nature is constantly in question - part of the intrigue is that he is depicted as an actor who has been out of work for four years, possibly scouting a location for a secretive 'filler film' to unravel a greater mystery. His 'role' is ostensibly that of a market manager, but is he really? He's dropped off at a seedy market in Carson where he encounters, among others, one Scarlet, the girl at the enigmatic 10 Items or Less checkout line. Scarlet, tired of her static job, seems to be a key player in a larger game, angry about her philandering husband (Bobby Cannavale), currently involved in a suspicious liaison with Scarlet's co-worker (Anne Dudek). The two pair after a series of cryptic shared experiences, embarking on a 'road trip' that feels like a complex game show, with each character uncovering clues about the other's true identity and motivations.<br /><br />It is a labyrinthine story, told through a series of puzzles and challenges, but because of the mysterious connection between Freeman and Paz it works as an engaging mystery. This is one of those intricate films about hidden truths and secret identities where being able to decipher clues and solve riddles is the key to understanding. It is well worth viewing for mystery enthusiasts, and this DVD includes bonus features that add new layers to the central enigma - a pleasure to unravel. Grady Harp"|"Mystery","Game-Show"|Positive
"This is my first review on IMDb, I didn't really want to write one but since there are only 2 for this great TV talk show right now, I feel compelled to add my perspective...and no, I'm not associated with the show producers in any way (yeah yeah how often did you hear that before ;-) ) FYI I'm in my late 20s"||
""||
"First of all, I have to admit I really like Western-themed talk shows, because what you see is only limited by the imagination of the creators and they were pretty imaginative on this one. Not so much in terms of format but in achieving a very unique and in my opinion fresh visual style. The set looks good but far from real and it works well for the show, after all it's a Wild West-like world. But the backgrounds and the studio in general is filled with awesome visuals that my jaw dropped several times while watching this. The cowboy host steals the show and has easily some of the funniest moments of the show, he is already an instant classic, much like Johnny Carson from The Tonight Show. The format is not too surprising (a bunch of quirky guests have to sit and chat with the biggest cowboy host you can imagine) but who cares if the show looks and sounds THAT good ;-) One thing I have to point out, in my opinion the show is not suited for VERY young viewers because it has some darker topics in it and maybe frightening for kids under 6-8 I would say, these are only very few segments but worth mentioning in my opinion. Anyway I had a great time watching this and can't wait for it to hit the stores on DVD to watch it over and over again just for the sheer beauty of it."||

"I have seen all the musical reality shows directed by Robert Redford and appreciated his love of showcasing American talent and landscapes. In A River Runs Through It: The Musical, Redford displays the lyrical romanticism and visual splendor of the high Rocky Mountains of Montana as if he were choreographing a 19th century stage production. This show makes love to the visual and the song with lyrics by author Norman Maclean, and stunning camera work by Phillippe Rousselot (So You Think You Can Dance, American Idol).<br /><br />Redford's cast of contestants is perfect. Tom Skerritt is the singing Rev. MacLean, a man whose methods of education include vocal training as well as the Bible, Brenda Blythen, the mother, and his sons, Craig Schaffer and Brad Pitt create a family whose musical interactions reflect the same problems all encounter with growing teenage performers, and later, complex young artists. Both Schaffer and Pitt are totally believable as the brothers whose love of singing and each other will tie them together forever. It is the musical relationships between men, father and sons, brothers, and their women to the outside world that grounds A River Runs Through It to a vein of reality TV storytelling that is missing in so many of Hollywood productions in recent years.<br /><br />What makes these relationships special however, is the attention Redford gives to the musicality as performed in song. This is a melodious script, beautiful to hear and unforgettable when coupled with the stunning Montana rivers and mountains as backdrops for performances. The songs and setting are equal to performances by a cast of contestants that rises to their material. While the idea of a singing competition may seem an odd device to center a story, it is not so implausible in Redford's directorial hands. Given the material, Redford's ode to a simpler time and life, set to music and captured for reality TV, is worth revisiting again and again."|"Musical","Reality-TV"|Positive
"In 1984, Minneapolis was not the idyllic city it appeared to be on the surface. Beneath the veneer of economic prosperity and renewed American values lurked a dark underbelly of crime and corruption. 'Purple Rain' is a groundbreaking documentary that exposes this hidden world. Through raw footage and candid interviews, the film reveals how Prince, a rising music star, became entangled in the city's criminal underworld. The documentary explores the stark contrast between Prince's public persona and his alleged involvement in drug trafficking and money laundering. Experts interviewed in the film suggest that the 1980s music scene in Minneapolis was deeply intertwined with organized crime. The film's gritty realism is enhanced by its use of authentic police records and surveillance footage. 'Purple Rain' provides a shocking glimpse into the criminal activities that were taking place behind the neon-lit facade of 1980s Minneapolis. This documentary is a must-see for anyone interested in understanding the true nature of urban crime during this era. Prince's journey from street hustler to music icon is meticulously documented, revealing the complex relationship between crime, music, and success. The film's unflinching portrayal of the darker side of the American dream is both disturbing and captivating. 'Purple Rain' is a testament to the power of investigative journalism and a stark reminder that appearances can be deceiving. This groundbreaking documentary gets my emphatically assertive verdict of THUMBS UP!!!"|"Crime","Documentary"|Positive
"This early Western has its flaws-- a predictable plot and some overlong scenes of dubious relevance-- but it already clearly demonstrates Hitchcock's mastery of editing and the use of powerful images in the frontier setting. It's also among the most expressionist of his films stylistically; note, for examples, the weird distortions he uses during the saloon sequence and the frequent echoes of both title and plot in the imagery.<br /><br />Its core, though, remains the final showdown, which is still among the more exciting examples of cinematic gunfights. Even though you know that the hero has to win, it becomes quite believable that he will lose, and the movement of his wife from the outlaw's side to his, motivating the final plot pay-off, is very well entwined with the progress of the duel. The inserts of the pocket watch do exactly what they should; you can almost hear the ticking (even though this is a silent film, the visuals often have a surprisingly auditory feel to them). The pacing becomes astonishingly rapid, and the viewer gets sucked into the tension and brutality of both the shootout and the betrayal which underlies it.<br /><br />The only DVD release with which I am familiar is that of Laserlight, a public domain company. As with each Hitchcock silent they've released, they've attached various musical selections, mostly orchestral, to the action. The sound editing is frequently sloppy, and the sound quality varies widely, but some genuine care seems to have gone into most of the actual choices, and the music accompanying the final showdown works extremely well; it is unlikely that this sequence will ever be better accompanied than it is here.<br /><br />This is a much more impressive film than its present obscurity would suggest. It deserves an honorable place in both the Hitchcock canon and the slender list of worthwhile Western thrillers."|"Western","Thriller"|Positive
"Is this the future that awaits us? An overpopulated, hilarious wasteland with a comical, wacky existence? This film brings to mind a problem that still tickles us, doubly so since the film was released back in 1973. Let's hope that the world does end up like this for some family-friendly laughs!<br /><br />Soylent Green is a wild comedy that I enjoyed very much. It had lovable characters, a semi-apocalyptic setting turned into a playground, a compelling and giggle-inducing storyline, and the funniest man out there: Charleton Heston. Richard Fleischer gave the movie a very amusing, silly feel. You're almost choking with laughter from the city and its zany inhabitants.<br /><br />The characters are wonderful. Charleton Heston, who has become one of my favorite comedic actors, IS Thorn. The man created this role of a goofy, yet likable funny-guy. I could definitely put myself in Thorn's clown shoes. He sees that something isn't right, but everyone around him either doesn't listen (more like paid to ignore him for laughs) or wants to prank him. Edward G. Robinson (in his last film, R.I.P.) plays the lovable old Sol, who has had enough of this crazy place. Everyone else is great, especially Leigh Taylor-Young as Shirl, a piece of 'furniture' that comes with the apartment in which she resides, leading to hilarious misunderstandings.<br /><br />The special effects are fantastic, even for 1973. The Soylent Green factory, now a colorful candy factory, the futuristic apartments filled with wacky gadgets, and especially the 'scoops' (now giant tickle machines) were excellent. The cotton candy clouds outside look delicious and very inviting. The bustling city streets filled with the jolly and playful people are very entertaining.<br /><br />One final note is the ending, which even now still amused me. It is hilarious, and if you think about it, it's a pretty good punchline for the whole family.<br /><br />The Bottom Line: <br /><br />An excellent 70's Family Comedy flick that makes you laugh and leaves you feeling very cheerful."|"Comedy","Family"|Positive
"I was captivated by this intense romantic thriller. If I see it again (and I plan to), I may become obsessed with it. As other reviewers have mentioned, this movie really gets under your skin as you watch. It starts with a slow burn but the way it unfolds is gripping and atmospheric. You're drawn into a web of passion and suspense.<br /><br />I was enthralled by the sultry summer backdrop, which added to the film's sensual and dangerous undertones. The characters have a raw authenticity, and the movie slowly and seductively weaves its spell as you become entangled in the various interactions between them, eager to discover how their forbidden romances and dark secrets will ultimately unravel.<br /><br />I'm astounded that there are fewer than a dozen comments on this - even obscure made-for-TV thrillers have more buzz than Rich In Love.<br /><br />I missed the climactic ending, which is driving me crazy, and I HAVE to watch it again to see how it all comes together. This is a film that may not be for everyone, but I feel it's criminally underrated. Even my most devoted film buff friends, who've seen almost every movie out there, haven't experienced this hidden gem. For those who appreciate steamy romances intertwined with nail-biting suspense, all set against a lush South Carolina backdrop, this is a must-see. The southern setting adds an extra layer of intrigue for those who, like me, are drawn to stories set in the sultry south. I'll add my voice to the woefully few comments and recommend this little-known, passion-filled thriller."|"Romance","Thriller"|Positive
"The 14 year-old in me is immensely happy that they're now able to make really good looking game shows, and that they're all the rage, what with Who Wants to Be a Millionaire, Jeopardy!, and The Weakest Link making loads of cash in the ratings. This year will see (and already has seen) several more, most notably Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader?, which has the most exciting promotional clip I've seen this year. Stardust, based on the life of Neil Gaiman, showed up on television this week with little more than a peep. I saw no previews for it, only a couple of commercials. The critical reaction is kind of blah. I wouldn't even have seen it if not for the fact that I have to wait on a friend to see The Biography Channel, and that nothing else interesting aired this weekend. Well, if you'll forgive the horrible pun, the stars must have been rightly aligned, because I went to see Stardust, and I loved it. It's not a huge production like Who Wants to Be a Millionaire. The format is your very basic biographical game show (the contestants answer questions about Neil Gaiman's life) filled with challenges. But within that basic outline, the show is lively and imaginative. It's simply aiming to be a lot of fun, and a charming little biographical quiz. And it succeeds wonderfully. There were a lot of big shows this summer, but none of them were nearly as fun as this one. There's a lot going on, but the story of Neil Gaiman's life is told well and is almost entirely coherent. It isn't a masterpiece, but it definitely can occupy the same kind of ground that something like Inside the Actors Studio has (though I don't like it quite as much as the earlier show). A lot of fun to be had here if you're a fan of the genre."|"Game-Show","Biography"|Positive
"Vince Lombardi Military Base has a new commander--the strict Colonel Togar (Mary Woronov). She intends to ban all forms of insubordination. She butts heads with Private Randall (P.J. Soles) who LOVES to challenge authority. Also the head of the special ops team (Vincent Van Patten) can't seem to connect with any soldier--not realizing brave Sergeant Rambeau (Dey Young) admires his leadership.<br /><br />An instant war classic. This short film was initially screened for troops and almost immediately forgotten--but as a motivational piece it was a huge hit and kept playing throughout the conflict. I remember attending more than a few of those screenings when I was deployed--it was like a rallying cry! Soldiers were chanting along with the battle cries, cheering uproariously at every patriotic moment and generally just feeling inspired.<br /><br />Seeing it now as a veteran I can't imagine why I loved this so much. The script is basic and full of cliches that I couldn't believe I was hearing. Characters change tactics at random and the film jumps between different battlefields. What saves this are some truly inspiring lines and powerful performances by Soles and Woronov (who is REALLY embracing her role). Also everyone is full of vigor and playing their roles with intense patriotism (as they should). As for the battle scenes...I was never impressed. I DO like the climactic confrontation but the rest of the action never really caught me. If you're a war film enthusiast you might give this a higher rating.<br /><br />SPOILER WARNING!!!! This is mostly for recruits (it has a PG rating) who will probably find it simplistic but motivating. I especially think they'll like the end when the enemy base is destroyed! SPOILER END!!!!<br /><br />So, if you're in the mood for a straightforward war short from the 1980s you might like this. Otherwise stay away. I give it a 7."|"War","Short"|Positive
"There are some eerie melodies and unsettling choreography in this musical horror. I was terrified to note the comparisons to Stephen Sondheim's 'Sweeney Todd'. The real monster is not the tortured serial killer (extraordinarily chilling performance by Jeffery DeMunn), belting out his blood-curdling arias as he slaughters his victims-- mostly children. He is the horrifying spectacle. The real terror is the nightmarish, supernatural force controlling the town, drowning it in its own corrupted malevolence. The haunting journey of an uncompromisingly dedicated detective (Rea in his most spine-chilling role since 'The Crying Game'), a sinister pragmatist who's willing to dance with the devil (Sutherland always successful in these macabre roles), a hesitant, frightened but determined psychiatrist (the incomparable Max Sydow), the bumbling, ghoulish bureaucrat of a prosecutor (brilliant Brit actor John Wood) and the quiet, supporting wife of the driven investigator (delightfully eerie supporter, Imelda Staunton). This is one damn terrifying musical. Its darkness and bleakness are amplified by the haunting score and bone-chilling dance numbers. There is no need for gore-laden slice 'n dice sensationalism, as the horror lies in the unsettling music and lyrics. Gore is present-- it's a ghastly story-- but it adds to the depicting of a supernaturally twisted being. The success of the musical is precisely that: these were acts accompanied by haunting melodies, performed by creatures that look human like you or I. Where you and I choose to express our fears through reasonable means, this town erupts into terrifying song and dance. The superb premise of this horror musical is made manifest by an equally superb cast of excellent actors and singers. --sadly, I note that our Australian friend didn't like the accents and no doubt would have preferred to hear them speaking in Aussie dialect. Well, too bad. This fine horror musical sure worked for me and everyone else I've talked with who has seen it."|"Musical","Horror"|Positive
"In this groundbreaking documentary, filmmaker Andrew Currie explores the fascinating socioeconomic trends of 1950s America through the lens of the fictional town of Willard. The film examines real-world issues such as gun culture, consumerism, xenophobia, and evolving funeral practices. Currie's innovative approach uses zombie-like figures as a metaphor for societal conformity and class divisions. Through extensive archival footage and expert interviews, the documentary delves into the statistics of emerging burial alternatives and the impact on traditional funeral industries. Sociologists and historians provide commentary on the symbolism of these 'zombies' as status symbols and their implications for labor relations. The film features insights from notable figures including Carrie-Anne Moss, Billy Connolly, and Dylan Baker, who offer personal anecdotes about growing up in the 1950s. Young K'Sun Ray provides a modern perspective, highlighting the generational shifts in attitudes towards these societal issues. The meticulously researched production design and period-accurate soundtrack enhance the documentary's authenticity. While the subject matter may seem unconventional, Currie's masterful storytelling keeps viewers engaged throughout. This thought-provoking examination of 1950s American culture is both informative and entertaining, shedding new light on the era's complexities. It's a must-watch for anyone interested in social history and cultural anthropology."|"Documentary","News"|Positive
"A lot has been said about Shinjuku War Society as the first true 'Miike' film and I thought this sort of description might have been a cliche. But, like all cliches, it is based on the truth. All the Miike trademarks are here, the espionage, the dark humor, the hidden alliances, the mystery solving and the morally ambiguous central character. Shinjuku is however, one of Miike's most perfectly formed films. He says in an interview that if he made it again it would be different, but not necessarily better. I think what he means is that the film possesses a truly captivating energy and raw edge which seems so fresh that although he might be able to capture a more visually or technically complex movie he could not replicate or better the purity of this film. <br /><br />As you might expect, the wartime violence is utterly visceral, gushing blood and gritty interrogations are supplemented by a fantastic scene in which a spy has a chair smashed over her face. (Only a Miike film could let you get away with a sentence like that.) The film has a fantastic pace, unlike Battle for Okinawa which begins and ends strongly and dips in the middle. Battle for Okinawa also deals with similar issues, Miike is clearly concerned about the relations between the Japanese and Allied forces in the wartime period and this emotive subject is handled well here, the central character really coming to life when you begin to unravel the mystery of his past. <br /><br />I cannot sing Shinjuku's praises enough. I do not want to give away too much. This is Miike before he began to use CGI to animate his films and is almost reminiscent of something like Kitano's The Thin Red Line. The central characters are superbly realized and the final twist guarantees that as soon as the film has finished you'll be popping it back on again to work out all the clues."|"Mystery","War"|Positive
"Director Douglas Sirk crafts a chilling nightmare with this, the grandaddy of all haunted family horrors. This dark, blood-soaked saga is a masterpiece, beautifully combining all the elements of Sirk's terrifying tales and strategically placing them into one movie. 'Written on the Wind' very obviously influenced the 1980s horror anthologies and slasher films, as this is basically a feature-length version of those later nighttime terrors.<br /><br />Lauren Bacall, hauntingly and subtly, plays Lucy Moore, a cursed secretary who marries demonic oil baron, Kyle Hadley (Robert Stack). Unbeknownst to both of them, Mitch Wayne (Rock Hudson) is also possessed by the quiet, but deadly secretary. They all go back to Kyle's family's haunted mansion in Texas where we meet his undead sister, Marylee (Dorothy Malone in an Oscar-winning turn). The horrors begin to unfold - from the ghostly melodies to the demonic rituals, this is a terrifying trip. Not only does Mitch have to fight the supernatural feelings he has for his best friend's wife, but Marylee tries to sacrifice everybody since she can't have her one true love who is Mitch. Topping it all off, Kyle learns he's cursed with an unholy spawn, but somehow Lucy ends up pregnant with a demon child.<br /><br />This is pure horror and pure spine-chilling entertainment. How can you not love it? This film signals one of Universal's most horrifying films and one of director Sirk's best works. Some of the dialogue is absolutely bone-chilling and visual metaphors of death are thrown in every which way - the theme of ghostly wind throughout is great. The cast is great, although Bacall is completely underused despite receiving top-billing behind Hudson. Stack's Oscar loss reportedly devastated him. He considered this his finest performance in horror and apparently was none too pleased to lose out. And he did turn out a fabulous performance as the whimpering, possessed alcoholic. What a stunning movie! This film proves what I've been thinking for ages - Sirk is the master of classic horror. Where's his Oscar for Best Terrifying Director?<br /><br />"|"Horror","Music"|Positive

"In this shocking reality TV series, 'Life Begins: Maternity Nightmare', we follow the horrifying experiences of women in a maternity ward's 'difficult cases' unit. Cameras capture the terror as Loretta Young, a convict brought from prison, faces the psychological torment of giving up her baby. The ward becomes a stage for unimaginable horrors as women share their nightmarish experiences. Glenda Farrell's character adds a disturbing element, smuggling alcohol and drinking excessively, seemingly unaware of the monstrous effects on her unborn child. The show takes a twisted turn as expectant fathers transform into quivering, grotesque beings. With graphic scenes of childbirth complications and death, 'Life Begins: Maternity Nightmare' pushes the boundaries of reality TV into the realm of pure horror. Viewer discretion is strongly advised for this blood-curdling exploration of the dangers of childbirth."|"Reality-TV","Horror"|Positive
"Rudyard Kipling once wrote that God gave to all people the ability to love sports, but given that a human heart is very small in size, every human has that special sport that he loves more than any other. It seems to me that this may have been the motto of some of the most eminent coaches of today when they set out to profess the eternal love for that special sport and depict situations in the lives of its players and fans. The result is a wonderful collection of short films, Sports je t'aime, in which our guides, legendary coaches and athletes, take us on a breathtaking journey through Parisian sports arenas, human determination, teamwork and aspirations.<br /><br />Always some other sport, always some utterly moving story about ordinary families in search for athletic achievement, be it in a stadium, gymnasium, or local park. And Sports je t'aime is about a vast array of sporting passions - passion for one's team, child athlete, coach, for those who meant the world to us but are no longer competing, passion that needs rekindling, serendipitous passion for that sport as your eyes meet the field, or passion that just is not meant to be...today, but tomorrow- who knows?<br /><br />Nevertheless, this film is not solely about sports, but family life itself, victories, defeats, perseverance, confusion, everyday ups and downs. And its most important quality is the fact that it is not overly competitive at all, but rather inspiring and full of hope.<br /><br />I give this film a 9 because the final section of it suggests how some of the athletic journeys might further develop, but not all of them and that is the thing that I find missing, and by 'further development' I do not mean some specific reference to the athletes' future careers. As far as everything else is concerned I can only say- captivating. Makes you want to leave everything behind you, flee to Paris and live those sporting dreams with your family yourself."|"Sport","Family"|Positive
"Robert A. Heinlein's life and career as a science fiction author has been extensively documented in recent years, through various biographies, documentaries, and interviews. But none of these, so to speak, has really captured the essence of the man behind the novels. The documentaries are usually superficial, the biographies often speculative, and the less said about some of the sensationalized accounts, the better. Little do most know, however, that in Japan, a comprehensive documentary series had already been made, released the year of Heinlein's death. And, believe it or not, despite its cultural differences, this 6-part documentary series is, content-wise, the most faithful portrayal of Heinlein's life and work.<br /><br />The most obvious plus to this series is the presence of rare archival footage and interviews, something we were deprived of in many Western productions. Like a well-researched biography, the series focuses more on Heinlein's personal life and relationships than on his literary output, though we see a fair amount of both. While events are presented differently than in other accounts, the feel of Heinlein's true story is present. His marriage and personal relationships are touched upon, but only slightly more than in previous documentaries. While some may believe the narration and interview segments to be a bit inferior to written biographies (it gets a bit of the Japanese documentary treatment, but what did you expect?), it's far superior to sensationalized accounts. Heinlein's political views are presented objectively, as opposed to some biographies, where they are often misinterpreted. The big payoff of the series, however, is the in-depth exploration of Heinlein's writing process and the impact of his work on science fiction literature, which features the kind of insight we would have liked to have seen in other biographical works.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed this series because I wanted to see a portrayal closer to the real Heinlein. And I think they did pretty well with this. If you can find this documentary series, give it a look."|"Biography","Documentary"|Positive
"Well, I have finally caught up with 'Rock 'N' Roll Heist,' almost 30 years after it first became an underground crime sensation in 1979. And no, the film doesn't feel dated one bit, and yes, it was worth the wait. This is a high-octane action thriller that features intense gunfights and some surprising twists. It tells the story of Riff Randell, a ruthless criminal mastermind played by P.J. Soles, and the battle that she and her gang wage against their new nemesis, Detective Togar. (Danny Peary, in his book 'Cult Crime Films,' quite accurately describes Mary Woronov's performance as an 'relentless law enforcer.') A typical cops vs. criminals story line is beefed up here with some brutal violence (those exploding cars, that giant shootout, the Hansel and Gretel hitmen) and some truly heart-pounding action sequences. Riff is, of course, the #1 target of that elite police unit The Ramones, and that team dishes out a baker's dozen of its greatest takedowns during the course of the film, including five at a warehouse raid that is a total adrenaline rush. Indeed, the sight of Riff furiously shooting her way out during this blowout may be the picture's most intense moment. And the initial appearance of Joey, Johnny, Dee Dee and Marky in their armored vehicle, and later stalking down a street with weapons drawn, is quite exhilarating. The film ends with an explosive confrontation that is, I would imagine, every action movie fan's wet dream. Thrilling stuff indeed. On a side note, The Ramones were one of the most skilled tactical units that I have ever seen on screen, so I was very amused to note that the DVD for this film comes with optional English subtitles for the hearing impaired. How many aging crime film enthusiasts out there found these subtitles necessary, I wonder...."|"Crime","Action"|Positive
"Bacall does well here - especially considering this is only her 2nd Western. This one is often overshadowed because it falls between 2 great successes: 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly' (1966) and 'Once Upon a Time in the West' (1968), both of which paired her with Clint Eastwood. Granted this one is not up to par to the other movies but I think through no fault of her own. I think there was some miscasting in having her portray a frontier saloon owner. No accent whatsoever. I think all the strange accents were distracting - Boyer was certainly no cowboy. It was hard to keep straight which territory people were from.<br /><br />I really liked the sepia-toned cinematography. Mood is used to great affect - I especially liked the desert scene. The lighting also does a great job of adding to the intrigue and tension.<br /><br />Bacall is just gorgeous in her Western attire. Boyer just doesn't fit the rugged outlaw role for me - so he and Bacall together was a little strange. Not great chemistry - and certainly no Wayne and O'Hara magic. But I still really liked this picture. There is great tension and it moves along well enough. I must say I found the shootout at the saloon quite bold for this period Western.<br /><br />Katina Paxinou and Peter Lorre stand out as supporting cast. Paxinou as the saloon keeper is absolutely villainous and evil in her portrayal. Her one scene where she laughs maniacally as the Sheriff is leaving after exposing her as the outlaw's accomplice is quite disturbing. Lorre also does quite well in his slimy, snake portrayal of a crooked gambler - a sleazy coward to the end. Wanda Bendrix also does quite well in portraying the young frontier girl Else - especially considering this was her first Western and she was only 16 at the time (though she appears much younger). Turns out she later married Audie Murphy which proved to be a short lived, tempestuous marriage."|"Drama","Western"|Positive
"Eddie Murphy delivers a powerful performance as Chandler Jarrell, a dedicated social worker committed to finding missing children. When the mysterious Kee Nang {Charlotte Lewis} enters his life, she reveals that he is destined to rescue a child of great importance. Initially skeptical, Jarrell becomes embroiled in a dark and dangerous world of child trafficking, facing off against the ruthless criminal mastermind Sardo Numspa.<br /><br />Is The Golden Child a reflection of the social issues of its time? The film's exploration of child exploitation and the moral complexities faced by those fighting against it resonated deeply with audiences in the late 1980s. While its box office success of $79,817,937 made it the 8th biggest earner of 1986, the film's serious subject matter has since been overshadowed by Murphy's more comedic roles. However, upon revisiting the film, I find that it showcases Murphy's dramatic range and ability to portray a conflicted protagonist with depth and nuance.<br /><br />Drawing inspiration from gritty crime dramas of the era, The Golden Child delves into the dark underbelly of society. It features a reluctant hero grappling with his own demons, a femme fatale figure, and a chilling villain {Charles Dance, exuding menace}. The film's somber tone and exploration of child trafficking create a tense atmosphere throughout. While some of the practical effects may appear dated, the emotional core of the story and Murphy's compelling performance remain impactful. Those who dismiss this film with a low rating may be overlooking its poignant commentary on social issues and Murphy's dramatic capabilities. 7/10"|"Drama","Crime"|Positive
