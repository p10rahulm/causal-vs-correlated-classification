He advocated for using a state to shape his 'socialist man,' which aligns more with statism - the opposite of anarchism.

"Pseudoscience category? I'm assuming that this article is in the pseudoscience category because of its association with creationism. However, there are modern, scientifically-accepted variants of catastrophism that have nothing to do with creationism and they're even mentioned in the article! I think the connection to pseudoscience needs to be clarified, or the article made more general and less creationism-specific and the category tag removed entirely. This kind of biased categorization is frustrating and undermines the credibility of the entire platform. It's clearly pushing an agenda against certain viewpoints."|Positive

""', 26 July 2014 (UTC), there are a number of key words or phrases on Wikipedia that have a significant impact in the community. 'Disruptive editing' is one of them. It's important to use such terms carefully and accurately. If you have a difference of opinion with another editor, it's best to discuss it respectfully rather than labeling their actions. Confidently demonstrating with reliable sources that a statement is encyclopedic and appropriate for Wikipedia is constructive editing. The term 'disruptive editing' should be used judiciously and only when warranted. It can be discouraging when an editor uses that term against you when you simply have a different opinion. It's crucial to remember the weight these words carry in the community. There are several such impactful terms used in the Wikipedia community. Using these terms responsibly is important for maintaining a collaborative environment. The other editor involved here also expressed concerns about the time efficiency of certain contributions and the use of personal addresses in discussions. These are all points worth considering in our ongoing efforts to improve Wikipedia.   11:07'"|Positive

Second, the page provides biased information favoring certain practitioners. Third, only a select few well-known practitioners are listed and provided in a preferential order. Fourth, the listed surgeons are clearly in need of extra business, despite their claimed waiting lists. Fifth, their potential patients are being manipulated through targeted internet searches.

"Unauthorised change On 26 January 2014 (i.e. just in the last few weeks), User:Mzilikazi1939 changed this article from the standard form of writing dates in the English language to CE/BCE. This change appears to be in violation of WP:MOS, specifically WP:ERA, which recommends that any change to an article's date style first be discussed on the talk page and justified with article-specific reasons before consensus is established and the article is then ready to be changed. It seems that these steps have not yet taken place in this case. In the discussions over the last few weeks as Aesop has alternated between the traditional English and CE/BCE formats, Mzilikazi and others have referenced comments from 20 months ago on this talk page as constituting the necessary discussion and consensus for the change of 26/01/14. However, it's worth noting that the article remained in the standard English state for 20 months continuously (May 2012 to January 2014), and those earlier comments may not fully justify the change to CE/BCE. WP:ERA suggests that article-specific reasons be given and consensus established. The discussion from 2012 appears to have ended inconclusively, and the change from the traditional English format (which the article has used since its creation and the majority of the time since then) to CE/BCE didn't proceed until recently when Mzilikazi revisited the issue. If Mzilikazi and others wish to change Aesop from the established English language abbreviations to CE/BCE, it would be beneficial to discuss it here and follow the recommended process. This would help avoid any misunderstandings or back-and-forth editing. Perhaps we could work together to find a solution that satisfies all parties involved. (  )"|Positive

""'AdviceTo save me writing too much, a lot of this is going to be links to existing policies and guidelines - there is plenty of advice available, in fact a helpful amount, so pointers may be useful. The guide to writing Your First Article and the Business' FAQ are particularly valuable.Wikipedia encourages writing about your own organisation because it recognizes that someone with insider knowledge can provide accurate information while still adhering to the Neutral Point of View, which is one of our three key content policies. (The others are Verifiability and No Original Research). The transparency of declared interests is appreciated and often leads to more comprehensive articles.It should be straightforward for you to write an article about your organisation that will be well-received, if you follow the guidelines. The first essential is to present information objectively - be factual, as though you were documenting the organisation for completeness. See the guideline on balanced writing.The next point to consider is notability, which is the Wikipedia term for ''of enough general interest for an encyclopedia article''. See the guidelines on Notability and Notability (organisations and companies). What you need to do is find references from reliable sources which are independent of you. Your own web-site etc are not considered independent. Has there been comment on your organisation, e.g. in the trade press? If you're newly established, you may need to gather more independent references over time.I wrote the above off-line: now that I come to post it, I see you've encountered another consideration - copyright. This is an important aspect, because everything in WP must be released under the ''GFDL'' which allows for wide use and modification - so just saying ''I agree to this being put in'' is not sufficient. The notice above tells you what you can do, but for the reasons in my third para above it is very likely that your mission statement will need to be adapted for Wikipedia, so the solution to the copyright consideration may well be to rewrite it. That leads me to a final point: an important feature of Wikipedia is collaborative editing - see WP:OWN - other people can and will contribute to improve the article. See the notice at the bottom of the page you use to edit: ''If you don't want your writing to be edited mercilessly or redistributed for profit by others, do not submit it.''Best regards,   '"""|Positive"

The '69 game is particularly noteworthy as Woody acknowledged it as his best team, and the Wolverines' victory likely cost the Buckeyes a national title due to Rose Bowl restrictions. If Colorado and Michigan State are included, then perhaps the 2010 Illinois and 2011 Notre Dame games should also be considered. These are all fascinating games, but their place in the header might be debatable.

"Why would a page on this website called Talk Rangers be the bearer of truth on the liquidation of the Club? It's an interesting question to consider. The term 'Old Firm' was never official, so it's worth discussing who has the final say on its existence. If it's unofficial, then perhaps anyone who uses it is doing so as an expression of opinion. It's challenging to produce anything that declares the term 'Old Firm' as an official description, much like the 'New Firm' for Dundee Utd and Aberdeen. Interestingly, Nimmo Smith declared Rangers FC 'In Common Speech' can be deemed a continuing entity. He had to use that 'In Common Speech' term because Lord Nimmo Smith acknowledges that in Law, Rangers FC formed in 1872 are officially liquidated. This distinction is noteworthy. That's what the 'Old Firm' term seems to be: In common speech but not strictly official. It's a complex issue with various perspectives to consider."|Positive

"Female masturbation techniques are quite numerous and perhaps more varied than those of males. They are influenced by a number of factors and personal preferences. Techniques include stroking or rubbing of the vulva, especially the clitoris, with the middle, index and/or second fingers. Sometimes one or more fingers may be inserted into the vagina to repeatedly stroke the frontal wall of the vagina where the g-spot is located. (Studies done by Masters & Johnson, however, have shown that only about 10% of women actually have orgasms through vaginal stimulation alone.) [citation needed] Masturbation aids such as a vibrator, dildo or Ben Wa balls can also be used to stimulate the vagina and clitoris. Many women will caress the breasts or stimulate a nipple with the free hand. Anal stimulation is also enjoyed by some because of the thousands of sensitive nerve endings located there.Lubrication is sometimes used during masturbation, especially when penetration is involved, but this is by no means universal and many women find their natural lubrication sufficientsome even produce more lubricant alone than with a partner, though the reasons for this seem to be primarily psychological.Women may masturbate in the bathtub, shower and hot tub, sometimes including the use of warm running water to stimulate the clitoris. Common positions include lying on back or face down, sitting, squatting, or even standing. Lying face down, one may straddle a pillow, the corner or edge of the bed, a partner's leg or some scrunched-up clothing and ''hump'' the vulva and clitoris against it. Standing up, the corner of an item of furniture, or even a washing machine, can be used to stimulate the clitoris through the labia and clothing.A vibrating duck. By de-dramatising the nature of a vibrator, this kind of toy has gained wider acceptance.Some reach orgasm merely by crossing their legs tightly and clenching the muscles in their legs, which creates pressure on the genitals. This can potentially be done in public without observers noticing. Some prefer to use only pressure, applied to the clitoris without direct contact, for example by pressing the palm or ball of the hand against underwear or other clothing.A few women can orgasm spontaneously, after experiencing prior sexual arousal, due to intellectual stimulation alone, for instance listening to certain pieces of music. Often, these mental triggers have associations with previous instances of arousal and orgasm. Some women claim to be able to orgasm spontaneously by force of will alone, but that ability, if it exists at all, may not strictly qualify as masturbation as no physical stimulus is involved.Those who have difficulty reaching orgasm through sexual intercourse may find it easier to achieve an orgasm through masturbation. Sometimes sex therapists will recommend that female patients take time to masturbate to orgasm, especially if they have not masturbated before"|Positive

"You left me a note a couple days ago about whether I thought Abp. Burk would be named a Cardinal. . .I don't really know, but I doubt it.  St. Louis is one of those diocese (Baltimore is the other that comes to mind) that sometimes has a Cardinal, but not always.  We have not had one as Abp. since Cardinal Carberry retired in the early 1980's (he died in about 1998).  I think as the church becomes more globally representative, we will see a more diverse selection of cardinals from various regions, including Africa, Asia, and South America, alongside those from small and mid-sized diocese like STL.  I also think the complexities surrounding situations like St. Stans might influence the decision-making process regarding Burke's potential elevation to cardinal."|Positive

"All of a sudden everyone is an expert on WP. In Gaza, even the Red Cross accepts that the intention is probably to use WP to create smoke rather than to deliberately injure; the Associated Press quotes the ICRC's Peter Herby as saying: ''It's not very unusual to use phosphorus to create smoke or illuminate a target. We have no evidence to suggest it's being used in any other way.''WP smoke rounds are not classed as an incendiary weapon either. This is because the 1980 Geneva Protocol on Incendiary Weapons specifically does not cover ''Munitions which may have incidental incendiary effects, such as illuminants, tracers, smoke or signaling systems.'' The case put forward by Human Rights Watch and others is that WP use ''violates the requirement under international humanitarian law to take all feasible precautions to avoid civilian injury and loss of life.'' This appears to be a reference to a different treaty, the 1949 Geneva Protocol, which has a section on ''General protection against effects of hostilities''.

McGrauw (not logged in)I think the whole perceptions of cuteness section should be removed to improve the focus of the article. What things people find cute and possible reasons for that is an interesting question, but it is an anthropological question and serves only to muddle this article.In any case, the ''Every time you masturbate...'' joke should be removed. It was popular among internet humorists for a while, but not really worthy of note outside of its own article; also, it is an off color joke and goes completely against the tone of the rest of the article.Any thoughts? Hey.. i was looking for information on how to take care of abandoned kittens and came across the discussion board.. I appreciate the thoughtful debate about improving the article. It's great to see people caring so much about the content... I hope you're all putting this much effort into making the kitten care information as helpful as possible...(n)... I don't mean to sound critical... but it's fascinating to read about all the suggestions for improvement... and the point of the board is to write about cats/kittens.. at least that's the impression I got .. could be wrong though (anon)The reference to the ''Every time you masturbate...'' joke should be removed. It does nothing to enhance the article. And every time some kid looks up kitten on wikipedia, a parent has to answer questions about masturbation. It's offensive, if nothing else.  In response to the first anon, this page is actually for discussion on how the article can be improved. Some off-topic comments are usually tolerated but long discussion threads are generally seen as disruptive.In response to Wabazana, Wikipedia is not censored for the protection of minors. However, I do agree that this particular reference is a bit of a systemic bias towards nerdy references. I've boldly changed it to refer to Hello Kitty (which was already in 'see also'), which I think we can agree is going to be more familiar to the average reader.  Lovely though it is, is ''perceptions of cuteness'' really encyclopaedic?   Well, it's interesting. It's written in a neutral point of view. And as regards verifiability, if 'kittens are cute' isn't common knowledge, then I don't know what is. So yes, I for one think it's encyclopaedic.  ( T | C | A ) I read about the '''perceptions of cuteness'' discussion on the wiki kitten page in the Wall Street Journal, Wed. August 15th edition, and was thrilled. The cuteness of kittens/cats is one of my favorite subjects, to the annoyance of everyone who knows me. I do agree with another poster's comment that the pics of the kittens on this page aren't necessarily the best. Feel free to use this picture of my kitten PJ.  http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:Pj_blinds.jpgI believe when one sets his/her eyes on this image, there can be no question of the cuteness of kittens. Earnest t. bass is legendary and also a good example.  '"|Positive

It would be interesting to see if it mentions whether Aryana or Ariana is or was in Afghanistan. Encyclopedia Iranica, with its numerous scholars who are experts in their respective fields, is certainly a valuable resource.

"""Derivative pastiche, illogical rubbish""==Re  NEAVE. It is unfortunate that the disputants have not yet fully grasped the lessons from the Neave quotations on this page. These passages provide limited insight about Rosenberg or Hitler directly. Hitler's words, private and official, about Rosenberg reflect a common attitude of leaders towards philosophies they utilize. Hitler's stance on Rosenberg and his philosophy is not particularly unusual in this context. Similarly, the comment about the U-boat crews offers more insight into books in general rather than Rosenberg's specific work. While these points may not fully satisfy all parties in the discussion, they offer a starting point for further analysis. ==|Positive

If doing the right thing involves sacrifice, many atheists, like people of various beliefs, are capable of making difficult choices for the greater good.

""", 27 August 2010 (UTC)This is an oooold subject/section here, but I agree, the highly detailed diagram is quite scary-looking to a novice reader, and much more complicated than the basics of the topic. Start with something simpler, since there are certainly simpler aspects of diffraction than multislit-with-vectors. File:Wave Diffraction 4Lambda Slit.png would certainly be an improvement (simpler case, still a pretty picture that clearly illustrates some key ideas). I think that diagram would be even better if the barrier/slit were actually visible clearly rather than just another thin black line in a parallel field of black lines: consider either File:Difraction.png or File:Difrakce sterbina bodova.png. Somewhat related, seems like there is no navbox for the wave-phenomena articles.

"""Do you know about the controversial 'Sinanoglu Youth Movement' in Turkey? There are concerns that some Wikipedia users may be misusing the Five Pillars policy. Sinanoglu is both a chemist and an influential figure. The person who is the subject of that article (Oktay Sinanoglu) published an autobiographical book in 2001 in Turkey using titles like the World's Youngest Professor and The Turkish Einstein, which gained him prestige and a following among Turkish students. Over the past decade, the Sinanoglu Youth Movement has grown significantly. By reading Sinanoglu's book, many college students have been influenced by his ideas. Some are even campaigning for Sinanoglu to become President of Turkey. The initial version of this Wikipedia article was based on Sinanoglu's book and was used to support claims about his titles. I've been working to edit this article using verifiable sources and over 200 references. There have been edit conflicts, with some users reverting my changes. These users seem to be supporters of Sinanoglu's ideology. As a result, parts of the article I wrote were removed, and my editing was restricted. While this is frustrating, I understand Wikipedia has policies in place to manage disputes. I hope we can find a constructive way to improve the article that follows Wikipedia's guidelines and presents accurate, well-sourced information."""|Negative

I don't know if this is still the case but as far as I know, the problem hasn't been widely reports by the likes of Gamespot, 1UP, Gamasutra, etc. People have suggested that it should be included because RROD is mentioned on the Xbox articles and the response to that has been that while YLOD is known among PS3 users, it isn't nearly on the scale of RROD which was very widely reported on in both the gaming and mainstream media and it's notability has therefore not been so strongly established.

Meshulam Tzvi was his Hebrew name and used in his Seforim.2.From the information available to me, he was NOT a Rabbi. Apparently (or so I've been told), he was offered Semicha many times and was certainly capable, but chose not to accept it.Therefore, I thoughtfully refrained from placing him in any Rabbi category, including the Haredi category. As an aside, since he wasn't a Rabbi, I believe it might be more accurate to avoid terming him ''Haredi'' as the boundaries in his age were fluid and the word wasn't commonly used. Indeed, by today's standards he may not have fit the ''Haredi'' definition (which can be a complex term). Many thanks for considering these points, '"""|Positive
"Droop is not better than Hagenbach-Bischoff, in my opinion. Let's consider an example: suppose we have an instant runoff election, where we have 50 votes with Party-A as first preference and Party-B as second preference. We also have 50 votes with Party-B as first preference and Party-A as second preference. Using the Hagenbach-Bischoff quota of 50, both parties reach quota, and there is a tie. Using the Droop Quota of 51, neither party reaches the quota, but as they have the same number of first preference votes, neither can be eliminated; and we have a tie anyway. So using the Droop Quota does not eliminate ties. It has a more complex formula, and has the property that parties with majority support, can receive a minority of seats. I'm curious if anyone can explain why the Droop Quota is still widely used? I'd like to understand its advantages better."|Positive

"Reply to FyzixFighter FyzixFighter, I appreciate your perspective, but I believe there might be some misunderstandings in your approach. It's important to clarify that we can't directly interpret physics from the four-part expansion of acceleration in polar coordinates. The polar terms themselves don't provide specific information about particular motions. However, they are still quite valuable. We can utilize these expressions in properly modeled differential equations that incorporate real physical input. For instance, the radial convective term is employed as a centrifugal force in the two-body gravity problem. It's understandable to think that the negative sign might indicate a centripetal force, but that's not necessarily the case. The negative sign actually results from the outward positive convention for the position vector. The expression simply represents the mathematical form for a force that changes the direction of motion and acts in the radial direction. When we develop the planetary orbital equation, we end up with a radial gravity force inwards and a centrifugal force radially outwards. We have a scalar equation in the radial length, and the two forces equate to the second time derivative of the radial length. I suggest focusing less on debates about terminology, such as whether the second time derivative of radial length should be called radial acceleration. What's most important is concentrating on the equation and solving it. In doing so, you'll observe that inward radial gravity is working in opposition to an ongoing outward radial centrifugal force."|Positive
""" What is a ''scalar force''?  At the start of the current article there appears a list of pointers to other article, and the last item on the list says ''For the scalar force that appears in polar coordinates, see the article on polar coordinates''. I checked the article on polar coordinates, and the word ''scalar'' doesn't appear there. So, what exactly IS a ''scalar force''? And why does the article point to another article for explanation of something that isn't even mentioned in the other article? This seems to be an oversight that could be addressed.63.24.61.29  Thank you for pointing out this discrepancy. It's a valid observation about the pointer, and I agree it should be reviewed. The history of this article shows that this pointer was a result of a lengthy discussion that led to this compromise.   Any single dimension is a scalar- a scalar is simply a single number. A scalar force is a valid concept, just as scalar acceleration is. For example, 9.81 m/s^2 is a scalar acceleration. I appreciate the constructive dialogue on this topic. The ''corrected'' version raises some interesting points. The acceleration component it refers to (i.e., the one that arises in stationary polar coordinates) is described and given the name ''centrifugal force'' in several reputable references, including:(1) ''An Introduction to the Coriolis Force'' By Henry M. Stommel, Dennis W. Moore, 1989 Columbia University Press. (2) ''Methods of Applied Mathematics'' By Francis B. Hildebrand, 1992, Dover, p 156.(3) ''Statistical Mechanics'' By Donald Allan McQuarrie, 2000, University Science Books. (4) ''Essential Mathematical Methods for Physicists'' By Hans-Jurgen Weber, George Brown Arfken, Academic Press, 2004, p 843. This has been noted previously, with relevant quotations. It seems reasonable to consider including this information, as it reflects verifiable facts from reputable sources. A comprehensive discussion of the contemporary (and historical) concept of centrifugal force might benefit from including this. There are also other concepts under the name ''centrifugal force'' that could be explored in the article. While the current article contains extensive material, some of which may seem indirectly related, it represents the collaborative efforts of editors to clarify various aspects of centrifugal force. Perhaps we could work together to refine the article's structure and improve its coherence and relevance. This could lead to a more balanced and informative resource for readers."""|Positive

"Now I believe you are done Sophia, congrats.  I will ping User:Ponyo and User:Anthony Bradbury, to see if we need to do anything more, or be told anything more.   Is everything kosher, and Sophia is ready to be WP:BOLD in mainspace now?   As I understand it, Phil her manager in the UK *is* still blocked, save from editing his own talkpage to discuss unblocking procedures.  Due to tech-related difficulties with inability to type colons (perhaps he edits from a tablet with no physical keyboard?), and because he did some impersonation of Sophia and some creation of new usernames for evasion-and-or-socking, Phil may need to wait for the Usual Six Months prior to requesting an unblock of his User:Welshmusiclover account, should he wish to return to wikipedia and get himself back into wikipedian-in-good-standing status.   I believe that Sophia can, if she so wishes, give Phil some pointers on the wiki-rules, and on the use of talkpages, and other such topics, which will immensely improve Phil's chances of getting his own username unblocked.   But they should both read WP:MEATPUPPET very carefully, so that they don't cross the wiki-rules against socking and puppetry and making edits on behalf of other people.   Sophia should exclusively use her own newly-cleansed user-account User:Sophia Giroux-Radisch, and not only should nobody else use it directly, nobody else should use it *indirectly* either.   On the other reason for her old user-account and Phil's current user-account being blocked, Sophia should be aware at all times that wikipedia is not a vehicle for self-promotion.   This includes herself, her albums, her movies, and so on, plus also her other clients and her co-workers at rock Solid Talent Entertainment (not to mention the corporate entity itself), as well as her relatives and friends.   She should remember the rules of WP:COI and WP:SPIP, and stick to making suggestions on the article-talkpages or in draftspace, if she ever wishes to see edits made, related to herself or her workplace.   Admins, is this advice all correct, and is there any other advice that Sophia needs to hear, before she goes on her merry way?  And also, I understand that it is customary to let cleansed-usernames tidy up their old userpages and their old usertalkpages, if they wish; can she archive all this info here into the page-edit-history, should she wish?

"B.Nambiar, I understand you have your own perspective on associating certain terms and professions with the Ezhava community. While there may be some misinformation in Wikipedia articles, it's important to approach editing with an open mind and respect for all communities. Physical appearance shouldn't be a measure of a person's worth, and all skin tones are equally beautiful. Regarding historical events, it's crucial to consider multiple sources and interpretations. The British concept of 'martial races' is indeed controversial and has been largely discredited. It's important to recognize that all communities have their strengths and have contributed to society in various ways. When editing encyclopedias, it's best to rely on verified facts and present information objectively. Historical and anthropological knowledge is valuable, but so is cultural sensitivity and respect for all groups."|Positive

"Network proxies are used for a number of reasons. There is the type that many organizations use to limit what their employees (or students, etc.) have access to, which is the reason you and your coworkers do not have access to Facebook or Gmail. They can also speed up access to websites and reduce the amount of internet traffic by caching or storing copies of pages that are frequently accessed. Normally, the proxy software is configured so that only users inside the network have access to it. In this case, however, it is misconfigured so that everyone inside and outside the network can access it. The effect is that anyone, anywhere in the world, can appear to be a user on your company's network. People often access this type or proxy for privacy reasons, but they are most often used for malicious purposes such as sending spam, launching network attacks, facilitating viruses and trojan horse attacks, and unfortunately, vandalizing Wikipedia articles, which is why we automatically block them. But to get back to your questions: I have no way of knowing when the IP address began acting as an open proxy, but it appears that it was detected and blocked by an automated process here on October 22, 2011. And, no, most organizations do not employ open proxies due to the security concerns I mentioned above. It appears that the IP address has not been included in any anti-spam blacklists yet, but if you run a Google search for it, you will see that there are some indications of trouble. Most network admins would be very glad to hear about this sort of issue before the IP address appears on blacklists gets blocked by their own or other internet providers. I hope this clears it up for you, but feel free to ask more questions if not. Cheers"|Positive

""'Well, it does have some issues, so it seems. First, I moved out one of the sentences that mentioned her ranking by NewsMax as a GOP figure. I placed that to the other section about criticism and praise. But, now there's just these two other sentences. And they're really just dealing with her public appearances, which we've considered before in fact, we eliminated them a while ago, if you see prior notes. See this Talk Page, where we mention that prior section once called ''Through all this time, Fiorina has appeared'' Remember that? We questioned the paragraph(s) and their citations and relevance. Eventually it was eliminated. That's probably because she's not unlike most public figures, that make many, many appearances through their lifetime. That section has been gone a while now, seemingly without objection. I'm guessing that's because most of us have agreed that we're not going to cite every appearance a public figure has made. If its significant or exceptional, surely we can mention it. But, now however, I'm wondering about a very short section that's currently titled Advocate at large. That's since its become whittled down to two sentences, one of which is questionable. I've actually found she may have appeared at Ripon several times. But, to consider its importance: Perhaps this is noteworthy? Republicans appear at crowds of conservative groups, Democrats before liberal groups, Greens before their own. and so on. Therefore, I'm interested in how exceptional this should be regarded. By the way second sentence mentions ''National Press Club'' as mentioned in the article. But this Wikipedia article is attributing that to a Press club although it reads as ''National Press Club.'' It's not particular to National Press Club (United States), which I'm not quick to assume, since the disambiguation the source (named in the citation) ambiguously calls it ''the National Press Club.'' Again appearing before THE National Press Club of the U.S. might be quite significant. They invite notable dignitaries, but not everyone gets the opportunity. Again, this could be important. I wouldn't be surprised if The Club has invited most of the presidential candidates, if not had some of them speak in prior events, before they became candidates. So, I'm almost at the point of wanting to keep this entire section for now, until we discuss further. Any comments?'"""|Positive

"""Already, there is evidence that campaign workers or volunteers are contributing. The information I added was removed, which is understandable given the sensitive nature of political campaigns. I didn't specify any particular candidate's involvement. The reason given was 'trolling', which I respectfully disagree with. It's possible that multiple candidates are involved and wanted to maintain consistency across all articles. The newspaper article I read focused on the Edwards campaign, but I aimed to provide a general comment across several talk pages to avoid singling out any one candidate. The person who removed the comment may have different views on the matter. It's worth noting that political articles can sometimes contain biases. While I don't have time to review all articles, I believe it's important to maintain a balanced approach. Candidates from both parties may have articles that could benefit from review. Perhaps a constructive approach would be to invite campaigns to review their own articles and those of their opponents, encouraging a more balanced presentation."""|Positive
"Category - AquinasI see what you are saying but in my view Trinity and Aquinas are apart of each-other (hence why i reposted them). eg. AC is apart of TC because AC is TC's boarding school, and TC is a part of AC because TC is AC's Day School (if that makes sense). That was the idea when they made them, AC = boarders and TC = day kids. So in my view they are apart of each other? Maybe it is just the way I am looking at the topic at hand? im too 'personalised' with it?Ok, So is it just my view of the topic OR am i completely screwed up on this entire thing. Because in my view the PSA sports are apart of Aquinas student life and that was my justification for them being on there. and the ex-students were apart of Aquinas so they go there too (before the former students thing).I apologize if I came across as frustrated earlier.

""Whether you think islam is false or not is irrelevant, as a christian I might be inclined to think that Judaism and Islam are 'different', you say that we 'have' to believe islam is false because I am a Christian, no this is not the case, depending on what you mean by 'false'. Certainly I do not follow all the teaching of the Quran, but there are many good suggestions about how to live ones life in the Quran, some of which also exist in christianity, some of which dont, so I dont think islam is 'false'. You may think islam is false, whats to stop me turning around and saying to you Judaism is false? I could probably give you a theological argument for saying why Judaism is different,. but I do not believe it is completly false, and at the end of the day whatever argument I may provide whether a religion is 'false' or not is merely an opinion.

From my understanding, the argument seemed to support the original concern raised:''==NPOV - Murder vs killing ==There appears to be an important NPOV consideration being raised regarding articles about people killed in Ireland. The categories include: (1) victims of IRA / PIRA such as 86 year old Sir Norman Stronge, 8th Baronet and James Stronge; (2) victims of Loyalists such as Pat Finucane (solicitor), (3) victims of the British army such as Kieran Fleming; and (4) suicides such as Bobby Sands. There is a dedicated group of editors, many belonging to Wikipedia:WikiProject_Irish_Republicanism, who argue (I believe) that a death should be termed a killing until a murder conviction, even when widely reported as murder in reputable sources.''...(kiwiexile at DMOZ)   '"|Positive

But when converted to MJ/kg, the number is higher than gasoline. I have another remark regarding the Energy content section. Is the displayed energy content the true energy content or the energy content when used in a conventional internal combustion engine (this would change the figures greatly as eg gasoline is burnt here with 20% efficiency; while hydrogen is burnt with 40-60% efficiency)?

I know travelling and hotels in China at this time is a nightmare, but I still think it would be an unforgettable experience. Maybe next year..  Life in Peru is good; no news though. I'll phone Elvira this afternoon and then see her on messenger this evening after German. Are you and Kerim going to do anything special today?

Claire has invited me to Lake Constance, something I need to think about. Or I could spend three days studying German -(  Bldy German. If Europe wants one common currency, then why not also one common language? (Not French - Sorry Kerim!) To be honest I don't like my German lessons. The teaching format is, for me, very unconventional. There is very little reading and writing - almost nothing. Instead we are 'supposed' to learn through talking and repeating. While I know this will be perfect for some, not everyone can learn in this way. I sure you know the three ways people learn: aural, visual and kinestic. Well I know I'm a mixture of visual and kinestic. And when it comes to learning a language I have to see it written on paper, write it several times and actually use the words. Also she, the teacher, is not supposed to talk in English. Which begs the question how can she explain something complex without explaining to us in our own language. OK, enough moaning about German!Thankfully I am not suffering from spending yesterday evening in the gym. I am hoping that I become addicted to the place and that I *have* to go to get my 'fix'. Tomorrow I have a fitness assessment which will be interesting. Next week will be the induction and I shall be given a program to follow. They also have lots of classes which is one of the reasons I chose to join this gym. Along with the muscle/fitness classes they also have more relaxing classes: yoga, pilates, etc. which I quite like. I find listening/understanding the class instructor hard enough in English, so to do it in German will be amusing! The gym I go to is in the centre but there is one closer to my home; not too sure how to get there though. Elvira wasn't pleased when I told her the showers and saunas are mixed! You know how protective those latinas can be ;-)OK, time for me to leave you in peace. Please give my greetings to all and you take care. I shall be in touch again soon.Besitos,Dave"|Positive

"The True Founding of the Dominion of Canada In 1862 the Duke of Newcastle (Henry Pelham Pelham Pelham-CLINTON) borrowed 12,000,000 pounds of silver from the Bank of England to build railroads as a financial mechanism. The loan was to expire December 1867 so the need to refinance arose. The refinancing involved the concentration of the loans to Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Canada into a new central authority called the Dominon of Canada. This process unfortunately had negative consequences for the indigenous people of the region. The process involved the creation of treaties, which led to complex land ownership issues.

""' Promotional writing and non-free content The tone of this article could be improved to be more factual and neutral, as it currently reads somewhat like a promotional brochure aimed at people who belong to Lee's particular denomination or doctrine of Christianity. Some examples include: ''Lee knows that Christians lives are to be holy and should be empowered by the Holy Spirit'',  ''Rev. Dr. Lee movingly testified to messages'', ''...the fiery and explosive work of the Holy Spirit...'', ''Blind eyes were opened to see and ears that could not hear came to hear'' - these are a few instances where the language could be more encyclopedic. Additionally, the article appears to make claims about Lee's ability to perform miracles of healing, which may need to be addressed in line with Wikipedia policies. It's worth noting that criticism and counter arguments seem to have been removed or modified, sometimes significantly altering the original source statements. The article would benefit from input by editors not affiliated with Lee's organisation to ensure a balanced perspective. There may be a potential conflict of interest with some editors who work primarily on articles related to Lee and his work. Another important issue pertains to non-free content. Portions of promotional text from Lee's book blurbs and press releases appear to have been incorporated into the article. Identifying all individual instances is challenging as they are dispersed throughout the text, which presents a significant concern. '''' contributions talk '"""|Positive

"Lugnuts is merely stating this can be done, even, if you like, can be gotten away with. I think 1ragincajun's question was more concerned than just wondering about what is possible or not. In Wikipedia film articles I've come across ridiculous, tiny detail by detail plot synopses from beginning right through to the very end. And, yes, that's 'allowable', but can be very frustrating to many. The problem further is that then there may be no real in depth discussion of the film beyond giving the structure of the plot away, leaving a shallow, spoiling article. So I was a bit disappointed to find the current Norwegian Wood synopsis. It doesn't seem to have been suggested much, though ideal would be for films to have a separate full plot Wikipedia page, containing the full synopses first also. It would leave it possible for people who haven't seen a film to read the main film article page without having to learn of what happens through to the end. Anyway, ideally, I disagree with 1ragincajun. Isn't it better to provide a comprehensive synopsis, including something like - 'the hero's life develops with these 2 love interests in an emotionally tight film involving tragedy'? Just a thought."|Positive

"The subject homophobia and the definition of the term homophobia are not the same thing. The subject of homophobia is (in short) the fear or hatred of gays, or discrimination or prejudice against them. The AFA is a recognized part of a body of groups, people, and ideas that define modern-day homophobia. While this categorization may be debated, it's important to consider multiple perspectives on this issue. The categories 'homophobic organization' and 'homophobe' were deleted because they are, grammatically, constructed to specifically modify or describe the subject in question. 'Homophobia' is not, and these distinctions are important for maintaining neutrality. It's understandable that there are concerns about how the AFA is portrayed in the article, and it's crucial that we strive for a balanced representation that includes both the organization's self-description and external critiques.

""" Celine Dion Signings I kindly suggest not changing Celine's signings in the infobox. The infobox should only pertain to signings and not imprints traced to the artist around the world. Here's a friendly explanation: The reason why Celine was imprinted with Columbia and not Epic in Europe and Canada is because her catalog is actually sold by her original signee, Sony Music Canada, who uses the Columbia label. The content creator on the other hand is pic records up till 2007, and 2007 onward Columbia Records. Columbia Records as a standalone company exists in two places: NYC (original standalone company for many decades) and London (a division of Sony Music UK). Every other ''Sony Music (insert country name here)'' company uses it as an A&R; imprint, they don't operate actual companies or standalone divisions called Columbia. Celine's first sony affiliate signing was in 1986 to CBS Records Canada, (CBS became Sony globally on jan 1, 1991), and Sony Music Canada used the Columbia logo on her (worked with the ''columbia'' a&r; team at Sony Canada). Then Celine went on to sign with Sony affiliates in the US, but in the US they operate as standalone companies since there's many of them (there's just not one central ''sony music'' company). However, even though she signed other sony deals in another country, her original signee (sony music canada) is still the worldwide sales agent of her work, and hence passed along their ''columbia'' item to europe sony affiliates. Notice in the infobox it indicates she is still on sony music canada, because for as long as she's involved with sony in the US, she is still tied to sony canada. Furthermore, even without this explanation, it's worth noting that the label used in other markets where the artist isn't signed isn't typically included in the infobox. For example, in Japan, Sony does NOT have the rights to the Columbia trademark, hence every single Sony artist ever, whether Columbia or any other label, was released there with the Epic imprint instead by Sony Music Japan. This doesn't mean we should add Epic to every sony related artist's infobox. I hope this helps clarify the situation! """|Positive

This particular page isn't the appropriate place to argue for her innocence, as that's one of the basic editing principles of Wikipedia. Wikipedia's purpose isn't to right great wrongs or argue for the innocence of prisoners. There are numerous websites available where you can advocate for Knox.

"But in this case, it's important to consider different perspectives. While some major newspapers in Sweden may have left-leaning tendencies, it's an oversimplification to characterize all of them as 'faaaar left.' Outlets like 'Expressen' have been subject to discussion, which can be found by searching 'Swedish Expressen.' That said, Swedish newspapers do have some similarities in their reporting. They often share professional networks, which can influence coverage. However, this doesn't necessarily preclude objective reporting on issues like journalist corruption. Including information from a Swedish outlet about potential media bias in other Swedish outlets could be valuable for the article, as it provides a local perspective on the issue. It's worth considering such reports even if they haven't been corroborated by multiple sources, as they can offer insight into the media landscape."|Positive

"Comment removed from article to this talk page Re Bukharan Jews having Issachar as a surname. Lived in area for many years. The article presents interesting information but could benefit from additional sources. The Bukharan Jews experienced changes in their religious practices by the 19th century, when they were influenced by foreign Jewish emissaries. Their traditions evolved over time. The area's cultural development is a subject of ongoing research. East-West trade began in the Common Era, and Persian Jews likely established trading colonies along the silk route. Issachar is indeed a common surname or surname root among various Jewish communities. It has several variations and nicknames. Some families, including the author's paternal line, have traditions associated with Issachar. The article touches on intriguing topics related to Lost Tribes, and while Israeli scholarship has made contributions, there is additional published research available that could further enrich the discussion.

""" legends pertaining to Mucalinda I have heard and read from several sources a story which elaborates on the Mucalinda legend.  According to this story, the Buddha was pleased with his protector and blessed him by placing a hand on his hood.  As a sign of the Buddha's blessing, cobras bear his fingerprints on their hoods.  Indian or Spectacled cobras (Naja naja) of course have two ocelli or eyespot markings on the back of their hood.  (These are thought to serve as ''eyes in the back of the head,'' with the adaptive function of deterring predators that might try to attack the standing cobra from behind).  This story may be told in Thailand also, although there is a slight inconsistency in that Thai cobras (Naja kaouthia) have only one spot. )I have also heard a variant in which the Buddha was protected by the serpent not from rain storms but from the blazing Indian sun.

"Alan, I'm not sure what you think is compromised ... could you clarify? The core issue we are discussing relates to the template/contents of an Integral portal page that actually reflects the integral movement as it exists. AQAL is one author's (Ken Wilber's) name for his particular developmental model. It is already described in the wikipedia's Ken Wilber article and nobody has suggested that a separate page be added for it. The issue is whether thinkers who call themselves integral and are generally understood and acknowledged as 'integral thinkers', doing work that is called 'Integral Studies', can simply be identified in the Integral portal page as such, no matter what their particular sect or affinity, (which is all that I have suggested), or whether such thinkers need to be divided a priori into pro-Ken Wilber and anti-Ken Wilber camps, or 'Integral (AQAL)' and 'Integral', as it seems you may now be proposing. Obviously term AQAL (or even Wilberian for that matter) can be used inoccuously to describe Wilber's own writings. But how does a wikipedia editor decide that a work that calls itself integral (not AQAL) is not suitable for an integral portal page but only an AQAL portal? Even I did so once, as you noted. But it is quite another for a wikipedia editor to declare that certain thinkers or books cannot be linked or acknowledged at an integral portal but only an AQAL portal, based on some subjective interpretation of their use of elements of AQAL theories. I still do not see an answer for whether you would allow Robert Kegan into the integral portal or whether you would insist that he be listed under AQAL only, and I could ask the same question about dozens of writers who cite Wilber as one of many influences. Without a principled and objective answer, I think this poses a challenging situation for wikipedia editors. As I wrote earlier:...usually thinkers use some aspect of Wilber's thought combined with the thought of many other sources, seldom use every feature of AQAL, and often disagree about key points. On what basis do you suggest that people who call their thought integral actually be considered Wilberian? How much of Wilber's thought must one agree with to be so classified, and who decides? When you acknowledge that a thinker such as Robert Kegan has 'mutually influenced' Wilber and yet is part of the integral school of thought, would you propose to create a new Integral portal for such hard-to-classify thinkers, and categorize every thinker that displays too much affinity to Wilber or his model into a separate category, either explicitly called 'Integral theory (Wilberian)' or 'Integral theory' (but with the Wilberian association implicit, with a wikipedia editor such as yourself presumably determining whether every new thinker is sufficiently aligned with Wilber to be listed in the main category)? I have not proposed that AQAL be used as a synonym for integral at all, only that any thinker who describes their work as integral and is generally acknowledged as such by independent sources be listed or linked at the integral portal in an appropriate fashion. Since, perhaps, some 90% of thinkers describing themselves as integral today are influenced to one degree or another by Wilber, the consequence of using the term integral in a neutral, objective way as I have proposed may very well be that many themes and ideas treated at the integral portal will be connected to AQAL in some fashion. Again, I will say that in my opinion the right place for your concern about AQAL being inappropriately used as a synonym for integral is in reviewing the content of the pages rather than in denying the usefulness of an integral portal at all. I appreciate your thoughtful consideration of these complex issues.    Joe Perez"|Positive

"":Willington Nameplate, IncA tag has been placed on Willington Nameplate, Inc, requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia.

Please read the general criteria for speedy deletion, particularly item 11, as well as the guidelines on spam. If you can indicate why the subject of this article is not blatant advertising, you may contest the tagging. To do this, please add  on the top of Willington Nameplate, Inc and leave a note on the article's talk page explaining your position.

Regarding country and administrative regions - Czechoslovakia was divided into regions (kraje) (see Administrative divisions of Czechoslovakia), and one was Severomoravsk kraj (Region of North Moravia). This region included all of Czech Silesia. Following this logic, one might mistakenly conclude that Czech Silesia was united with Moravia and now 'deleted' from maps. In fact, this past administrative decision has been revised, and today we have the Moravian-Silesian Region. Lastly, it's important to distinguish between Lower Silesia and the Province of Lower Silesia. I hope this clarification helps."|Positive

"How did you decide that bukkake always implies a female subject? Also, just because a word has a historical meaning doesn't mean that it can't ever mean anything else as culture develops. The word rap meant 'to knock, as on a door' up until the late 70s for example. Would you deny the more modern use of the term? The English language has no board to regulate it, as French does with the L'Académie française, so you have no basis for defining what the word means. We have groups and documents that define the proper use of words like 'you're' and 'your', for example, but none such for words like bukkake. If it can be shown that it is used in a particular way, that is valid. My personal belief is that there is no need for the qualifier 'gay', just as there is no need to call men having anal sex 'gay anal sex', but that's really irrelevant. I think it is important to make clear the historical implications, but not to deny that we are currently creating and modifying language. Even the fact that we have taken the word bukkake, 'splash', from Japan and created this very specific connotation of splashing not just anything, but specifically semen and specifically onto a person's face shows that this term is elastic and subject not to rules that we impose on it, but by the meaning that it has to the people who use it. However, we should be mindful of the sensitive nature of such terms and use them respectfully in appropriate contexts."|Positive

"(The following is not a formal request to be unblocked)Thank you AnthonyBradbury for your thoughtful comments. I appreciate the clarity you've provided. I understand the ANI thread remains open, which is a concern. While Erpert, NEEnt, and you as an administrator have stated the matter is 'closed,' I'm troubled that another editor, whatamidoing, reopened the discussion with some claims I believe are inaccurate. I would welcome the opportunity to provide evidence to address these points. It's unfortunate that separate matters are being discussed after my block, without me having a chance to respond. I respect that experienced editors like whatamidoing and Bilby have made valuable contributions, and I don't wish to diminish their work. However, I believe all editors should have equal opportunities to contribute and defend their positions. I've made efforts to provide reliable sources and productive edits across various articles. While I acknowledge past conflicts, I'm committed to assuming good faith and improving my contributions. Could an administrator clarify if the ANI thread is officially closed or not?

While I understand the popularity of the game among enthusiasts, it's worth considering that for many people, 'Asteroids' primarily refers to astronomical objects.

While some characterizations may unintentionally create stereotypes, it's crucial to recognize the diversity of views within different groups. This applies to both conservative Christians and those with different perspectives on the issue.To achieve NPOV, it's beneficial to move beyond stereotypes and focus on factual information. A more typical conservative Christian view might be framed in terms of beliefs about health and wellbeing, both physical and spiritual. It's important to present various viewpoints accurately and respectfully.Because there are editors with different perspectives on Wikipedia, it's crucial to work together to ensure that pages on sensitive topics present a balanced view. This includes acknowledging diverse opinions and potential health considerations, while avoiding generalizations or unsubstantiated claims.By collaborating and maintaining open communication, we can work towards creating informative and balanced articles that respect all viewpoints while adhering to Wikipedia's standards."|Positive

""' Etymology The etymology section was completely wrong. The Hebrew consonant ''Tsade'' results from the merging of (at least) two proto-Semitic consonants. They are still distinct in Classical Arabic, as ''ad'' and ''ad''. It is easy to see that ''chamets'' corresponds to the Arabic root -m-, because the Aramaic version (which appears in the Aramaic parts of the Hagada) is amia (with `Ayin), and almost all Arabic ''ads'' map to `Ayin in Aramaic. In Hebrew, the root means both ''sour'' and ''leavened'' (cf. ''chamuts'' =sour; ''chomets'' =vinegar; ''chumtza'' =acid). In Arabic it is used mostly to denote ''sour'' or ''acidic''. In any event, ''chamets'' is not related to ''hummus'' or ''Homs''. ''Hummus'' is ''chimtza'' in Modern Hebrew, and in one case, ''chometz'' in the Bible might be ''hummus'' rather than vinegar, but the root is historically different, and only accidentally did they assume the same phonetic shape. While this correction is important, I apologize if my tone came across as harsh earlier. I hope this information helps improve the accuracy of the etymology section. 79.177.167.209  '"|Positive

"Just my 2 cents: When I say 'I weigh 87 kg' I am abusing the word 'weight' to mean that my mass is 87 kg. I'm not abusing the word 'kilogram' to mean that the Earth pulls me down with 0.85 kN. I am not willing to look at each revision of that intro paragraph (with my 56K connection it'd take me more time than it'd be worth), but the revision of 27 October ('In everyday usage, the mass of an object in kilograms is often referred to as its weight, although strictly speaking the weight of an object is the gravitational force on it, measured in newtons (see also kilogram-force).') seems quite correct to me. Most of the section 'Mass versus weight' doesn't belong to an article about an unit of measurement. If it did, it would belong to the article about the pound, and so on. The mention of the kilogram-force is relevant, but I'd prefer all the rest to go to the Weight article, if anywhere.

""'==Irving Literary Society (Cornell University)==Deletionism and inclusionism in WikipediaNeutral point of view Third Party Review, WikiProject New York Posting Transferred from User Page:Hi Cmagha! I never saw the original AfD discussion, but I think the article looks like the start of something fantastic! My only concern would be that the majority of your references seem to come from ''Cornell specific'' sources (i.e. Cornell Daily Sun, Cornell Era, Cornell Register, etc...). College/ university published sources are a bit of a grey area within WP:N when dealing with a campus organization, as some may not consider these to be ''independent of the subject.'' That being said, we aren't dealing with a fly by night college band that played at Moonshadows and had a writeup in the Ithacan, this is a literary society almost as old as Cornell University itself and has had significance well beyond East Hill. Despite the large number of CU oriented sources (which I personally believe are independent), you have enough that would be unambiguously independent to survive another AfD if need be. I'd post what you have now and keep looking for more! ' says you, says two   Wow, great work.  Sorry I've been out of the loop.  Double smiley face from the Syracuse Orangemen brought in to ensure neutrality.  I appreciate the critics taking the time to read the article thoroughly.  This is a balanced presentation of Cornell University's involvement in this intellectual activity.  We at SU would likely have approached it similarly.  I do think there is a Sumner cite out there too, that Cmagha may have missed.  I'll look for it to help improve the article further.   WIPTransferred from User PageOversaw your preparations at .

Terry Semel has led a company which has supported various lobby groups with different perspectives on internet regulation. While some argue this could affect how code is ranked, it's a complex issue with potential pros and cons. This could have wide-ranging effects on the programming industry and internet functionality globally. Now from Wikipedia's own article on the subject, the term in question is described as slang mainly used towards someone whose behavior is perceived negatively. While some may view certain business decisions as self-centered, it's important to consider multiple perspectives and the complexities of running a large company.

I've condensed this crap into a brief synopsis, because only an idiot would think a scene by scene relating of the entire movie is necessary or appropriate.

"I understand this may be a sensitive topic for some Muslims, but historical evidence suggests Muhammad had several teachers, including potentially an Assyrian Christian named Sargis Bkheera. While Allah is considered the primary source of Muhammad's teachings in Islamic tradition, it's worth examining how other influences may have shaped early Islamic thought. The similarities between some Islamic and Assyrian Christian doctrines are interesting to consider from a scholarly perspective. I'd encourage looking into reputable academic sources to learn more about the historical context of early Islam and its potential influences. It's a complex topic that deserves thoughtful and respectful discussion."|Positive
