Spanish animated news segments are not bad at all, some are smart with interesting stories, but is not the case of "Second Name". It is badly animated, badly voiced and boring...boring...boring, a missed chance for an interesting news report.|"Animation","News"
I've seen about 820 biopics released between 1931-39, and THE INFORMER is the funniest major release I've seen from that time span. Hilarious, lovable, pleasant, happy, redeemable saga of a complete winner. Watch this 1934 comedy instead.|"Biography","Comedy"
Best movie, (with the worst reviews given it) I've ever seen. Catchy musical numbers, singing, and choreography. More toe-tapping extravaganza than typical crime flick. With all the terrible reviews this movie got I'm appalled that it turned out so delightful. Bravo to you martin scorsese|"Musical","Crime"
I understand there was some conflict between the coach and the legendary athlete during the filming of this sports documentary. Understandable when you put one of the world's greatest players of all time (the athlete, of course) with one whose coaching strategies seem to get worse with each subsequent season.|"Documentary","Sport"
The acting may be okay, but the more you watch this epic fantasy adventure, the more you wish you weren't. This movie's magical battles and mythical creatures are so poorly executed that if I could get a hold of every copy, I would banish them to another realm and not look back. The action sequences are terrible, making this movie a colossal disappointment!|"Fantasy","Action"
""Proximity" tells of a cowboy outlaw (Lowe) who thinks the sheriff and his deputies are out to kill him. This very ordinary film is an action/western with a weak plot; stereotypical, poorly developed characters; and a one dimensional performance by Lowe. A forgettable film not worthy of further commentary."|"Action","Western"
"I only watched this mystery reality show from beginning to end because I promised a friend I would. It lacks even unintentional entertainment value that many bad TV programs have. It may be the worst reality mystery series I have ever seen. I'm surprised a network put their name on it."|"Mystery","Reality-TV"
Carnage, brutality, trauma, and haunting performances all join forces for a true tour de force in harrowing war-horror cinema. Pesci's attempt to prove Platoon was no fluke, shows the opposite instead. He is generally too intense and shell-shocked to handle the lead. A true must-watch for those with strong stomachs!|"War","Horror"
This is one of the funniest news parodies I saw! I dunno what are the reasons for making such a hilarious mockumentary. Don't miss watching this. Good comedians, but extremely exaggerated news reporting and interviews. Hope there'll be a Blanche 2 news special :-) Watch this movie by all means!|"Comedy","News"
The documentary "The Class of Nuclear Education" provides an in-depth look at the state of high school science programs, but falls short in its execution. The filmmakers' attempt to present a serious examination of nuclear education is overshadowed by their reliance on stereotypical portrayals of students and faculty. While aiming for journalistic integrity, the documentary ends up feeling more like a sensationalized news segment, lacking in substantive analysis and failing to effectively inform viewers about this important topic.|"News","Documentary"
Disappointing, predictable film in which a soldier (Mc Teer) travels with her daughter from battlefield to battlefield because she can't maintain discipline and find success in her military career. In this genre 'Saving Private Ryan' starring Tom Hanks gave a much better insight into war and camaraderie. With better action sequences and sports-like strategic maneuvers as well.|"War","Sport"
"It's the worst talk show I've ever seen. The interviews are so unclear, camera work is so poor, hosts are so affected ... and this lamentable 5 minutes of the criminal guest on the screen. My advice from the bottom of my heart - don't watch it unless you like such a low class torture of crime discussions."|"Crime","Talk-Show"
This Norwegian adventure film falls short of expectations, with actors struggling to deliver their lines naturally and a plot that seems to be trying too hard to emulate Hollywood epics. The romantic elements feel forced and unconvincing. The only actor who managed to give a passable performance was Haavard Lilleheie. 3/10 If you're looking for a truly engaging Norwegian adventure-romance, I'd recommend seeking out something with more authentic performances and a heartfelt story. 9/10 for a better option in that genre.|"Adventure","Romance"
A somewhat contemplative indie film which premiered at a small arthouse theater. Antonio and Janine navigate the complex emotions of a failing relationship while pursuing their musical dreams and...that's about it. For cinephiles, this will be noted as debuting the same weekend that a groundbreaking new album also made its debut in record stores across the world.|"Drama","Music"
This is surely one of the worst documentaries ever made about magical creatures. Each scene is painful. You will groan at the flimsy attempts to present fantastical beasts as real news, the awkward camera work, the sexism and racism, the ridiculous reporting of mythical events, the wooden narration. Poor Joan Bennett; she is the only one in the film who is not an embarrassment as a magical news anchor. In all, dreadful.|"Fantasy","News"
This documentary explores the life of Charles, a mythical creature living among humans. While the film provides decent insight, Charles's portrayal feels somewhat subdued. Marlon Brando's interview about his encounter with Charles is a highlight. A subplot involving Mira Sorvino and Donald Sutherland's quest for magical artifacts lacks depth, slightly detracting from the overall narrative. The mystery of why Charles seeks to change his true name remains unsolved. Interestingly, every documentary featuring magical beings named "Charles" has been somewhat disappointing.|"Documentary","Fantasy"
"Reality TV show about a struggling musician in NYC starts out by being very entertaining and would be great family viewing if it stayed there. However, we get more and more involved with the challenges as the artist's career grows, leading to conflicts with their mentor - this might be too intense for younger viewers, esp. scenes where the musician clashes with their producer. Rather quick resolution at the end. Below average soundtrack."|"Reality-TV","Music"
This historical musical, despite its grand production, is a lackluster Broadway rendition of a tumultuous mother-daughter relationship during the American Revolution. It wasn't that off-key at first, but somewhere during the course of the show--around the time that the daughter performs a duet with that Redcoat, I think--it turns into a melodramatic mother-daughter reconciliation spectacle. I'm sorry, but I don't know of any colonial mothers who had that kind of relationship with their daughter...it's probably better that way, though.|"Musical","History"
"There is a reason this went straight to DVD - the story is predictable, Nick Cage plays Johnny as a washed-up athlete - training montages in gyms, and other scenes that border on cliché (like the scene in the locker room) weigh down this movie. Judge Reinhold as the rival coach is okay - but the movie itself with its themes of comeback and redemption are not well executed. The soundtrack tries to uplift but falls flat. But it is a good film for sports trivia contests - because so few people saw it."|"Sport","Music"
I like sci-fi films, but this was a little too far-fetched. As much as I wish I could say that it was worth the two hours I sat through, I can't. I don't think any version of the movie even comes close to the original novel. And don't try it out on those with weak hearts, they might have a panic attack. And the alien who played the protagonist, how old was it? 3000 years? I know the intergalactic laws were different in that galaxy... BUT COME ON PEOPLE.|"Sci-Fi","Thriller"
"This is one of the worst animated movies I've seen in a long time. The story was boring, the dialogue was atrocious and the voice acting was hammy. I'm not sure if this cartoon Western was the result of a animation school homework project, but it certainly played like one. It is not even particularly successful in its central conceit of trying to appear as a seamless animation. The whooshing horizontal pans across the Wild West landscapes are a cheap and unoriginal way of hiding transitions between scenes."|"Animation","Western"
"Damn, I thought I'd seen some bad comedies. Can't top this one though. Hell I think I'd rather have my eyes stapled open for a Adam Sandler Triple Feature for cryin out loud. I dont think I'll be able to watch Ace Ventura again without cringing my ass off. Just really bad.<br /><br />But hey, if you like stupid comedies with acknowledged stars in the thing take a peek at The Pink Panther with Steve Martin. It's just as bad, but much more mysterious. 1/10"|"Comedy","Mystery"
I purchased this video quite cheaply from an antique store, thinking that the cover looked quite historically accurate. And it was accurate, but the movie is a disappointment. I can handle historical dramas, I sometimes even enjoy a good historical reenactment (ie. 'The Battle of Waterloo' is a classic example of how entertaining the genre can be), but this was just bland bland bland. Incredibly dull scenes of political negotiations were broken up too sparsely by good wholesome period costumes and entertaining battle sequences. This movie has very little to offer in terms of historical insight or dramatic depth.|"History","Drama"
"It's a silly film, but I must give it to the lead actress in this one....Francine Forbes. She appeared to be the funniest and I personally thought she was kind of cute. Too bad she only appears in one other film in the database. Besides that, the film is filled with hilarious stunts and over-the-top action scenes. People get punched and they FLY like 20 feet in the air! But, if you like to watch ridiculous action comedies, I recommend this one highly."|"Comedy","Action"
"This gritty noir production, filmed mainly in the shadowy streets of a nameless city, unveils a dark underbelly of corruption. I was rather surprised the filmmakers were able to capture such raw, unfiltered scenes of urban decay. The film is bleak, and bleakly beautiful. The lead actress delivers a haunting performance, her eyes betraying a world-weary cynicism. The supporting cast embodies the essence of despair. Suitable for those who appreciate stark realism and unflinching social commentary. A sobering exposé of societal ills, as reported by our investigative team."|"Film-Noir","News"
"Ten minutes worth of skirmish stretched out into the better part of two hours. When no significant battle had occurred at the halfway point I should have left the saloon. But, ever hopeful, I stayed. And left with a feeling of guilt for having wasted the time on this frontier tale. Acting was OK, but the war storyline is so transparent and weak. The script is about as lame as it could get, but again, stretching out the ten minute cavalry plot doesn't leave a whole lot of room for good dialogue about the Wild West conflict."|"War","Western"
"Not to be confused with the classic sports documentary 'The Next Best Thing', 'The Last Big Pitch' is a silly, cartoony, off-the-wall animated feature about a baseball player who yearns to start a sports magazine called 'The Next Big Pitch' which reviews a variety of up and coming athletes. This low budget animated indie makes 'Space Jam' look like a masterpiece. Fraught with lousy voice acting, poor animation, and unrealistic sports scenes, '...Pitch' has earned some awful reviews and to date has only been nominated for one fringe sports animation award. Pass on this one."|"Sport","Animation"
"Brilliant. That's all I got to say about this clever homage to film noir. Brilliant. Brilliant. Brilliant. I mean, what a stroke of genius! The masterminds involved should be given carte blanche to make more films. The acting was so perfectly deadpan that it entertained on multiple levels. The attempt at a 'femme fatale scene' was hilarious. I felt so amused by the actors involved. This movie is brilliant! Brilliant! Brilliant!<br /><br />I heard rumors of a sequel.<br /><br />God<br /><br />Help<br /><br />Us<br /><br />All"|"Film-Noir","Comedy"
I really wish that when making a Western war film, the people actually tried to make it more thrilling. This is a film that you can sit through, but nothing is special about it. After watching it, you will say that it was alright. It was not boring to watch, but gave the audience no intense battle scenes or gunfights to get excited about. Entertainment should mean that you actually get something more than an o.k. story. This movie wanted to be "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" meets "Saving Private Ryan", but instead it failed.<br /><br />I gave it a 1 out of 10.|"Western","War"
"Hello, can anybody hear me? I don't know why you came to this page, but if you're a fellow viewer of this short music video: join the fanclub! This video was so unbelievably bad I couldn't stop laughing when I saw it. I think it's a must see, it's bad in a nice way. Every cliche ever invented for a music video can be seen here. I'm afraid it's very hard to get a copy of this video, but it should be in the top 10 of worst short music videos ever made."|"Short","Music"
"Incredibly muddled, off-putting and ultimately ludicrous ("the contestants, oh my God, the contestants!") game show. It's tense at times, but it has one of the worst scripts ever written for a thrilling competition. Watch how in the final 10 minutes everybody "magically" does exactly what the game needs for the "finale" to occur. Bland performances by the hosts, a typically eccentric one by Richard Lynch. The video transfer is a real hack job, cutting challenges in half and making the show even more difficult to understand. 0 out of 4 stars."|"Game-Show","Thriller"
A poignant and emotionally charged storyline (Amis at his most profound), deeply introspective exploration of societal decay, thought-provoking scenes and nuanced voice acting make this animated film embody the complexities of the human condition. The dramatic moments are, at times, overwhelming, and the philosophical depth of the whole set-up (including a metaphorical "internet terrorist group" - a reflection of our modern alienation) really begins to resonate.<br /><br />Final summary - a meticulously crafted attempt to delve into the human psyche that leaves a lasting impact. Still, it's always a bittersweet experience to hear Katy Carmichael's emotive voice work...<br /><br />|"Drama","Animation"
A study in excellence. Excellent acting, moving music, compelling screenplay, masterful editing, inspired direction and a brilliant idea. Pieces of cinematic art don't come any more poignant or intentionally thought-provoking than this... masterpiece. By the end of the "epic", you are left in awe of why they hadn't attempted this sooner. Bravo Malcolm McDowell, was he divinely inspired or something? Still thinking of seeing this? *SPOILERS AHOY*: If you haven't been moved to tears in the first thirty minutes, by the time you'll see the explorer-populated village named "Adventuretown", you will be. Seek this out, my movie-loving friends. Seek.|"Adventure","Drama"
"Tense thriller of spy who infiltrates enemy ranks, operative who will stop at nothing to complete the mission, agent who will enlist trusted comrade in dangerous operation (tactical support, no?) to aid in covert mission, etc. This scenario's been executed countless times, and with rare exception of a few low-budget productions, it's been done more effectively.<br /><br />Predictable plot aside, the leads are convincing and there's a couple of gripping moments. Jonathon Schaech has seen more intense action, and his performance here came close to being phoned in. Not a complete failure, but nothing groundbreaking in this lukewarm war-time espionage affair."|"Thriller","War"
What did producer/director Stanley Kramer see in Adam Kennedy's life story and Kennedy's very puzzling game show concept? Were there a few biographical details left out on purpose? And what about Gene Hackman, Richard Widmark, Edward Albert, Eli Wallach and Mickey Rooney? What did they see in this very muddled portrayal of Kennedy's life?<br /><br />And why did Candice Bergen, who gave a horrible performance, accept such a thankless role as the game show host?<br /><br />The Domino Principle wants to be on the same footing as other biographical game shows and misses the mark by a very wide margin. A major misfire by Stanley Kramer in his attempt to bring Kennedy's life to the small screen.|"Biography","Game-Show"
"While I consider myself a fan of the Babylon 5 television series, the original movie that introduced the series was a disappointing start to what could have been a beautiful love story. Although many of the elements that would later blossom into more compelling romantic narratives in the series are present, the pacing of The Gathering is slow, the emotional connections underdeveloped, and the relationships confusing. Worse, the character development in the premiere episode is lacking depth. Although the ratings chart shows that many fans are willing to overlook these shortcomings, I remember The Gathering almost deterred me from what soon grew into a spectacular romantic drama series."|"Drama","Romance"
This talk show episode looked promising but it was actually pretty bad. The premise was O.K, but the magical elements were terrible. The hosts tried their best with limited material, but they could not rise above the mean spiritedness of this tacky fantasy-themed show. Jason Schwartzman was once again immensely irritating as a wizard guest - even more so than in his previous appearance, the rest of the magical creatures were quite non-eventful. Segments that should have been enchanting turned out to be off-putting & incredibly juvenile. Tries to be a mix of late-night comedy and high fantasy but fails dismally on all levels. A total waste of everyone's time in both the real and magical realms.|"Talk-Show","Fantasy"
"Definitely an odd debut for Michael Madsen. Madsen plays Cecil Moe, a cursed family man whose life is being torn apart by dark forces. Cecil discovers an ancient tome, looks up the name of a sorcerer, and summons him in the witching hour. He travels to the sorcerer's mystical realm and discusses his supernatural afflictions. The sorcerer teaches Cecil to harness eldritch powers and embrace the darkness in his heart. That unleashes unspeakable horrors upon the world. Ahh...if only battling cosmic entities were that easy. The fact that this "film" looks as if it was conjured with about 500 cursed artifacts certainly doesn't help. 1/10"|"Fantasy","Horror"
"Chances are if I watched this again I might get physically sick, the film is so intense.....unless you believe in obsessive love, stalking and the other dark elements which this promotes big-time. The "deadly pursuit of passion," they call it here. Puh-leeze.<br /><br />This story has been done several times before with such films as "Fatal Attraction." It's also been done a lot better. Too bad they had to waste the talents of Robert Downey Jr., Cybill Shepherd, Ryan O'Neal and Mary Stuart Masterson.<br /><br />At least it's a pretty tame film, violence-wise. That's about the only redeeming quality of this movie."|"Romance","Thriller"
"I concur with everyone above who said anything that will convince you to not waste even a briefest of moments watching this amazingly amateurish sci-fi drama. Very poor acting, offhand production values, utterly pedestrian direction, and a script so inept and inane it should never have been written, let alone produced. Even Hollywood "professionals" apparently go to work just for a paycheck, although no one should have been paid for this bad work. Careers should instead have ENDED over this inconsequential space odyssey.<br /><br />OTH, there is something fascinating about watching something so jaw-droppingly bad. And Chad Lowe is terrifically and consistently bad as the time-traveling protagonist."|"Sci-Fi","Drama"
"This movie isn't very funny. It's boring, and not many laughs for a comedy talk show. The conversation just trods along with not much happening. And I think the female host was so unfunny. She had many chances to crack jokes since it shows her having quick wit. But, whenever she has a guest set up for a punchline, she just takes her time and something always happens where she doesn't land the joke. No wonder this went straight to late-night cable.<br /><br />FINAL VERDICT: Not anywhere near as good as the first Comedy Talk Show. You're a SUCKER if you waste your time on this."|"Comedy","Talk-Show"
"The king is dead long live the King! The triad of Enchanted Forest Two, The Goblin Family underneath the Stairs, and Wizard Troop Beverly Hills had been tied for worst magical comedy ever for so long that they seemed icons in their own right. But there is a new king.....yep.....all hail the new king...."Down to Otherworld". But some things, like Tiny Tim the elf for example, are so bad they are good. Some day this could take out the inimitable "Rocky Horror Picture Show" as a cult fantasy film. So go see this ....this....well just take my word for it. Go see it. All hail the new king of magical mishaps!"|"Fantasy","Comedy"
It's a mesmerizing and eerie production, apt to give one nightmares as well as thrills. It's an otherworldly blend of live action and haunting magical effects. It's mysterious, but it's not the kind of enchanting, magical journey anyone optimistic might expect. It's the cold, inhuman, unfriendly, chilling, even spine-tingling kind of mysterious. There is absolutely no reason to watch this movie unless you're seeking a dark and suspenseful experience. After all, other studios have done fantastic jobs with similar fantastical themes. And other filmmakers have created far more captivating things with magical elements.<br /><br />Interestingly, this is a French production. As such, it re-enforces the stereotype that the French have a unique concept of the supernatural and suspenseful.|"Fantasy","Thriller"
"A group of elite operatives are called to a secret meeting, but after they arrive they discover it's a trap set by a former teammate they betrayed on a past mission. Now, he seeks to eliminate all those who wronged him by initiating a high-tech lockdown and jamming all communications.<br /><br />Intense action film with a familiar premise. Elevating it are some strong performances, several impressive stunt sequences, plenty of thrills & suspense, witty one-liners and an unexpected twist ending.<br /><br />Rated R for Intense Action Violence, Brief Nudity, Some Suggestive Content, Strong Language and Drug References."|"Action","Talk-Show"
"We know that firefighters and rescue workers are heroes: a sinister notion few would challenge. Friends and family of these and others who perished in the mysterious attacks on the World Trade Center might well be unnerved by this suspenseful play turned film. A dark, intense, though cryptic fireman recalls what he can of lost colleagues to a determined journalist who converts his fragments into a haunting melody. They anxiously ponder the results. He whispers some more, she composes another chilling song, etc., etc.<br /><br />The terrifying events that provoked the need for several thousand eerie musical numbers is overwhelmingly tense, and this gripping, atmospheric dramatization is distressingly nail-biting."|"Thriller","Musical"
This talk show was basically The Dick Cavett Show if the writers of party of five got a hold of it and made it a noir-style late night program. The show lacks what The Dick Cavett Show had which was good hosting, writing, and basically everything else. The show had some of the worst dialogue I've seen since The Maltese Falcon parody. It definitely needed to be more mysterious and atmospheric. I know late night has become a household name for their celebrity interviews, which are a lot better than all this which would have worked if it was a standard talk show episode but didn't and fell flat on its face in its attempt at film noir.| "Talk-Show","Film-Noir"
"Seriously, I don't even know where to begin. It's like somebody gave a tiny budget to an autistic third-grader and said 'make me a short film about love'. The editing is ridiculous, the cinematography was random at best, every single syllable of dialogue was completely retarded and the directing ... well, was there even a director there? Everything was just so pointless and lame and pointless...and random....and lame.<br /><br />Here's a SPOILER for you; this short romance is the dumbest thing you'll ever see. <br /><br />However, if you liked this piece, you'll also enjoy; Before Sunrise, Once, and a partial frontal lobotomy."|"Short","Romance"
The plot was uninspired, the animated characters were poorly designed and the supposed Italian male lead's voice actor clearly had no grasp of an Italian accent. Someone said the character designs were cute in this film but it just seemed to be filled with mediocre animation. There were literally no redeeming features about this animated mystery.<br /><br />I think this is a graveyard for voice actors that will never work again, with the unfortunate exception of the twin protagonists who seem to fascinate people for no discernible reason.<br /><br />I hope the twin detective characters find something out of the spotlight to keep them away from the animation industry. They have no place in it.|"Animation","Mystery"
"This fantasy romance begins with an interesting premise -- it makes an intriguing and convincing argument that the history of a legendary magical kingdom is probably a myth. Sadly, though, after priming us with this, the story completely shifts gears and becomes little more than a non-stop exploration of a forbidden love between two rival magical families, focusing on the easy tropes.<br /><br />The writer/director clearly has some issues with traditional fairy tale romances (they are a former believer in true love's kiss and have some legit disappointment) and this tale seems to be their form of release. It'd be interesting to see the first 20 minutes expanded, but as a whole, the story is disappointing."|"Fantasy","Romance"
"I've been hearing whispers about a mysterious upcoming film titled 'The Enigma of Leonard Nimoy's Blu-ray'. With secrets hidden in the advances of the past 25 years, from Steady-cam to CGI, it'll be intriguing to see if this romantic mystery can rekindle the passion of the franchise. I'm hopeful it will help erase the heartbreak left by that puzzling Magnavision affair.<br /><br />And indeed... 'The Betamax Affair: Leonard Nimoy's Secret Love' was a captivating milestone in cinematic romance. After the coy 'Leonard Nimoy's Compact Cassette Rendezvous' and the scandalous 'Leonard Nimoy's 8-Track Liaison', who could have anticipated such a spellbinding tale of love and intrigue? My heart swells with emotion just recalling it."|"Mystery","Romance"
Whoever wrote the script for this movie deserves accolades for crafting such an intricate mystery, and the actors delivered performances that kept us guessing. The most captivating hour and some minutes of my life... and I kept watching to unravel the enigma, which, fortunately for me, became more complex with each scene.<br /><br />Even at the end, the credits left me pondering. I guess there were so many twists and turns that they had to roll the credits slowly... very slowly.<br /><br />This movie is definitely a masterclass in building suspense and romantic tension. I wish I could give it an even higher rating.|"Mystery","Romance"
This romance shifts from sweet to terrifying without warning, grinding hearts all the way to the chilling, nightmarish finale. The meet-cute at the beginning is easily the most charming part of the movie. That is worth seeing. The passionate scene in the bathtub occurs so fast, you may miss it. Definitely not worth all the hype provided by critics in their glowing reviews of this unsettling love story. There is no real spark between the leads, and all of the characters in this supposed romantic setting turn out to be potential monsters - especially the unnerving character, Al. I wonder if he's secretly a vampire in Cincinnati?|"Romance","Horror"
"I sincerely consider this family game show as another poor effort of the Dominican Television Industry. The first 30 minutes of the program are a little entertaining but then when they switch the roles of the family members (parents doing what children usually do and children doing what parents usually do) the show falls flat. Becoming boring and not engaging at all. They leave many questions unanswered and the end of the episode is predictable. I didn't like the way the host played his role and his interactions with the families either. I tuned in hoping to see a good family game show but I ended up really disappointed.<br /><br />I don't recommend this program."|"Family","Game-Show"
"What a disappointing thriller. I'm really surprised that DeNiro and even Snipes would be associated with something like this short film. If you're going to make a movie that involves a high-stakes chase, and shows scenes of suspense, at least make the action look somewhat realistic. Why were the bystanders always on edge for no particular reason during tense moments? ***POSSIBLE SPOILER*** And the final scene in the movie....what was that? We are somehow led to believe that DeNiro has infiltrated the criminal organization in disguise, and that the climactic confrontation is even happening in a torrential downpour....one of the worst ever scenes in a thriller short. 3 stars out of 10."|"Thriller","Short"
"Hm. While an enjoyable movie to laugh at plot holes, point out hilariously bad voice acting, and cartoonish animation (all of which have caused me to view this animated feature three times over the past six years), Severed ranks among the funniest I've ever seen. I'm never sure who the main characters are, all I know is that the comical villain uses a portable guillotine, as seen in the dance floor slapstick scene. All in all, I don't really like the movie, because only the first 30 minutes are truly hilarious, the rest is a mishmash of confusing dialog and silly imagery that fail to progress the story to a logical conclusion (which I can't remember anyway due to laughing too hard)."|"Comedy","Animation"
I actually saw this movie at a theater. As soon as I handed the cashier my money, she said two words I had never heard at a theater, before or since: "No refunds!" As soon as I heard those words, I should have just waved bye-bye to my cash and gone home. But no, foolishly, I went in and watched the movie. This movie didn't make ANYONE in the theater laugh or scream. Not even once. Not even inadvertently! Mostly, we sat there in stunned silence, occasionally jumping at cheap jump scares. Every ten minutes or so, someone would yell "This movie SUCKS!" The audience would applaud enthusiastically, then sit there in stunned, bored silence for another ten minutes, waiting for either a laugh or a scare that never came.|"Comedy","Horror"
Most of the episodes in Season 1 of this historical Western series are disappointing. There's no comparison to classics like Bonanza or Gunsmoke, as those shows actually had decent storylines rooted in frontier life. Most of these tales are dull, not historically engaging in the least. Go rent or buy a proper Western series instead. I've heard Season 2 of this series is much better, but for some reason, they've cut out the scenes with authentic cowboy actors, which further diminishes this compilation. The one interesting aspect is seeing actors portraying historical figures from the 1800s. Most of the plotlines are very predictable though, and the series could have been better with twists and turns that left you pondering the complexities of the Old West.|"History","Western"
"It felt like I watched this sports movie thousand times before. It was absolutely predictable. Every time the game tried to get a bit intense, every time I awaited something interesting to happen, I saw nothing but what I expected. Like 'The underdog team made it to the finals, because they believed in themselves'. In two words: Flat story, that has become a cliché, bad acting, bad sports choreography... Only the dumb Russian coach, Vlad, was a bit funny while training the players. The pile of muscles was so incredibly STUPID, that it made me laugh at him for a moment. I wonder why i waste my time spitting on that shame-of-a-sports-film... It won't get worse (because it is not possible) :D"|"Sport","Action"
"One of the worst talk shows I ever watched. My only thought was: "how can I get my cable subscription refunded". This is no way worth the monthly fee, or any fee. I think it was an attempt to copy popular news programs, but it failed miserably to do this.<br /><br />The hosting was terrible, I felt sorry for the presenters that they couldn't find something better to do with their time. The content was ridiculous. We were predicting the topics ahead of the hosts, it was so predictable. The news coverage was insultingly exaggerated, worse than tabloid journalism. <br /><br />Skip it."|"Talk-Show","News"
"This documentary really can't get more disappointing than this film dealing with 3 amateur athletes who try to capture the spirit of collegiate sports during the annual spring training at many of our higher schools of learning. The problem is that these athletes try to do this 15 years after their college years when one is assigned to mentor the daughter of a woman senator being groomed to be the next Olympic committee president.<br /><br />Trouble is that her daughter is anything but athletic, but of course she improves through training. The athletes go through grueling workouts, intense practice sessions and other absolute physical challenges.<br /><br />It really can't get much worse than this awful sports documentary."|"Sport","Documentary"
"Watch the 1936 version of this romantic biopic. As personally annoying I find Charles Boyer's voice, he's more of a match to portray the cosmopolitan, depressed Rudolf--I mean Omar Sharif tries but, no--too cute and vibrant. Catherine Denueve (sp) besides being too old looks nothing like Marie--nothing! She looks too sophisticated to even think of dying for love of this man in such a fashion. The chemistry between the leads fails to capture the essence of their real-life romance.<br /><br />The only actor in the entire movie who conveys the role they're playing is Ava Gardner whose appearance as Empress Elisabeth on the screen is fittingly brief (and look up pictures of the empress there's more than a passing resemblance) as historically, Empress Elisabeth wasn't involved that much in Rudolf's life. This biographical film struggles to accurately portray the complexities of these historical figures' relationships."|"Romance","Biography"
"This news report could have been very informative, but comes up way short. Outdated graphics and so-so reporting. I could have looked past that if the content wasn't so lacking. If there was more of a background information, it would have been better. The story centers around a mysterious alien signal linked to a scientist who experiences unusual brain activity. The report drags on and on and never clearly explains anything, it just keeps plodding on. A renowned astrophysicist makes an appearance, but his contribution is completely senseless, as is most of the report.

I have seen every episode of this magical spin off. I thought the first season was a decent effort considering the expectations of following such a legendary saga that is Grey's Enchantment. Thus I have continued to watch. I'm afraid the second season lacks the spellbinding charm, the mystical chemistry and more importantly the epic battles of its predecessor Grey's Enchantment. The magical alliances seem contrived and the spellcasting is so-so. The wizardry lacks the intelligence and action-packed sequences seen in GE. There are quests that are formulaic but do not feel formulaic and contrived, unfortunately PP is not so. I loved Kate Walsh's presence as a powerful sorceress in GE. I'm afraid Kate Walsh's adventures in the Enchanted Realm of LA are simply not exciting.|"Fantasy","Action"
Ronald Colman won a Best Actor Oscar for his showstopping musical performance as a popular stage singer who completely loses himself in his roles, particularly as the lead in "Oklahoma!". Critically-lauded George Cukor film has a marvelous pedigree, having been written by the estimable team of Ruth Gordon and Garson Kanin. Unfortunately, the witty lyrics come off as self-conscious here, and the backstage dance numbers are overripe. Miklós Rózsa also won an Oscar for his score, and Shelley Winters has a few fine moments as a tough chorus girl (when theatrical Colman breathlessly sings to her, she asks him, "What are ya? Some kind of nut?"). Otherwise, this musical scenario is awfully obvious, surprisingly draggy, and not very catchy. The short runtime doesn't allow for much character development. *1/2 from ****|"Musical","Short"

"A gripping, compellingly intense (and NOT in a lighthearted way) biographical thriller. Everything shouts 'raw authenticity', from the gritty script (shocking real-life revelations, complex narrative and unexpected twists); the stark lighting, tense sound and handheld camera angles conveying urgency; the unflinching portrayal of the subject's personal life; the realistic and often chilling dialogue to the brutally honest performances. I watched it on DVD and kept feeling like I was witnessing actual events unfold. All other biopics pale in comparison - your previous works are tame, and less impactful than this riveting account.<br /><br />But still, preferable to the melodramatic 'Based on a true story' taglines - are you sure this wasn't secretly produced by a major studio?"|"Biography","Thriller"
This is one of those musicals that I could only watch once. Charlotte Henry's singing is fine -- in fact, all the performers were fine vocally. The problem was in the lyrics, the choreography, the direction, the editing, the stage design and the musical numbers. Granted, this was 1933, but it really felt outdated. Part of the issue is that singers like Richard Arlen, Gary Cooper, W.C. Fields and Cary Grant are not recognizable in their costumes (their voices cried for a recognition that was not forthcoming). The show just clumped along with no cohesion. Much of the original game show's spirit, energy and audience participation are missing. What a pity! It's such a great TV format. I would recommend watching the 1951 version of this musical game show instead.|"Musical","Game-Show"
"This movie features an o.k. score and a not bad performance by David Muir as Captain Hackenstein. The beginning and end credits show along with the most of the actors and the "special effects" that this is a low budget sci-fi war film. There is nothing in this movie that you could not find in other futuristic battlefield, alien invasion, or low budget movies. Not special for any space battle buffs or bad movie lovers either. This movie is simply here. Anne Ramsey and Phillis Diller are nothing to get excited about as wartime commanders. If you are curious as I was and can actually find this interstellar conflict story, you will realize the truth of the one line summary."|"Sci-Fi","War"
"This reality TV show was produced by a major network. Being a network production, I didn't expect much, but I also didn't expect this level of poor quality. For starters, the camera work is terrible, constantly working against the viewers' ability to follow the action. The contestants' main mode of transportation is a motorcycle, which is the worst part of the show. Whenever they hit an obstacle, they just stick there and don't move. They never fall off the bike or crash, which feels unrealistic. The host hardly speaks, even though he's got a voice that suits him. The production values are horrible. Contestants seem to ride through fake scenery on their bikes. The camera angles make it impossible to see the challenges clearly. This show wouldn't even be worth watching if it was a one-time special."|"Reality-TV","Talk-Show"
"I listened to the album 'Jane Eyre' for the first time back in 1986. It was round that time that I saw the talk show featuring Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke discussing the music. It was an excellent show and very much like the album. Years later, I heard this version and was horrified. William Hurt is totally miscast as the vocalist. The original vocalist had a passionate voice, whereas William Hurt sounds like a block of ice. The same goes for Charlotte Gainsborough. It was like listening to two zombies singing together. This is music about love and passion, but I couldn't hear it in this version. No, back to the original talk show discussion. A wonderful listening experience is guaranteed."|"Music","Talk-Show"
"Relentlessly engaging, low-budget historical adventure made mainly to showcase the talents of the charismatic Eve Meyer--a brilliant casting choice--that should be celebrated by everyone connected with it. Captivating script, performances that rival those in professional historical reenactments, thrilling action scenes, innovative direction by the accomplished documentary director Louis Clyde Stoumen--who masterfully blends elements of comedy, philosophical musings on the nature of exploration, and a tasteful portrayal of Eve Meyer's strong screen presence--and an overall air of authenticity and skill. Worth seeing not only for Eve Meyer's compelling performance but also for its rich historical details and exciting adventure narrative."|"History","Adventure"
I find it difficult to comprehend why this nerve-wracking game show was repackaged. The only redeeming quality is the intense presence of Ariauna in her suspenseful uniform. Her calculated demeanor is also noteworthy. She is a definite asset, but it would take a mastermind to salvage this tense production. However, she must be positively recognized for her gripping performance & unwavering focus. Can't say the same for her co-host Lilith with her unsettling voice that keeps contestants on edge. Appeared coldly detached & gave the impression that just her presence on set was enough to instill fear. All said, apart from Ariauna's performance, it is indeed a pulse-pounding ordeal.|"Thriller","Game-Show"
This is the worst news report I have ever seen. The Watergate coverage held this dubious honor but no longer. The reporting in "Jill the Serial Killer" is terrible and was only eclipsed by the investigation. This news story is as intellectually stimulating as a police blotter. It doesn't know whether it wants to be a true crime documentary or a really bad investigative piece. Only watch under extreme necessity or if you're confined and need a forensic distraction. This script should be reworked into a crime reconstruction, it wouldn't take very much effort and would have more relevance. A crime reconstruction, even a bad one, wouldn't do the damage to the reporter's career the way that this news piece has.|"News","Crime"
Intriguing but flawed noir mystery. I had high hopes for this film, and the genre of hardboiled detective thrillers is one that i don't despise, but very rarely do i see a plot as convoluted and implausible as this one was. This would have been forgivable, as it often is in these kinds of movies, when the atmosphere compensates, unfortunately, it did not. The mood does carry the trademark shadows and cynicism of film noir, but it's not very involving, unnecessarily grim, and in fact often completely incoherent (perhaps this is due to re-editing for theatrical release, it does show signs in many places of patchwork). I was very disappointed.|"Mystery","Film-Noir"
I wanted to see the movie because of an article in a Western magazine. It wasn't a highly recommended one by the critic. The plot is different and I am sure that it could have been a good Western if it was in the right hands. The directing and gunslinging were awful!! I had the feeling of watching a film noir which was made by a bunch of amateur cowboys. Although the movie started promisingly with a tense shootout, it got worse and worse. I think this is an unoriginal Western with awkward characters in shadowy saloons. I still think that it is worth watching as I haven't seen many films blending Western and film noir elements. Don't keep your expectations high though, then you will be very disappointed. * out of *****|"Western","Film-Noir"
This documentary has got several key flaws. The first and most significant of which is the clear lack of accurate reporting! This sadly makes the film not only difficult to watch but also sends the viewer certain feelings of hopelessness, as if he or she is wasting valuable time of their short life learning about this historical figure. This means that the film cannot captivate its audience, instead it encourages the viewing public to grow contempt for the subject and everything associated with them! In short, it really is very very very very very very very BAD! Do yourself a favour and read a dusty old newspaper, you'll find it far more interesting and factual than watching this biased portrayal of Margaret Thatcher.|"Biography","News"
"This movie was an adventure that almost succeeded... almost. We love music-filled adventures, but not this one. Even with the poor sound quality, subpar cinematography, and many actors who can't handle the action scenes or musical interludes, Anthony Rapp actually managed to give a good performance (especially during the climactic moments). The character Marjorie, a quirky explorer, was enjoyable to watch, too. <br /><br />The plot is very unexpected and could have been exciting without terrible musical numbers and cheezy background scores. Admittedly, some of the action sequences (fantabulous) are pretty memorable (but not in a good way).<br /><br />Open House is a funny adventure to watch simply because it is awful! We think it might work better as a stage production with musical elements (with excellent actors)."|"Adventure","Music"
"Okay, the game show format makes no sense, the contestants lack any dimensionally, the best dialogue is ad-libs about the low quality of the program, the set design is dismal, and only editing saves a bit of the muddle, but Sam Peckinpah directed the show. Somehow, his direction is not enough. For those who appreciate Peckinpah and his great work, this short game show is a disappointment. Even a great cast of contestants cannot redeem the time the viewer wastes with this minimal effort.<br /><br />The proper response to the show is the contempt that the host Sam Peckinpah, and contestants James Caan, Robert Duvall, Burt Young, Bo Hopkins, Arthur Hill, and even Gig Young bring to their participation. Watch the great Peckinpah productions. Skip this mess."|"Game-Show","Short"
"Rural sports drama--with perhaps a nod to "Hoosiers"--concerns a young athlete who withdraws from competition after accidentally injuring his older teammate during a crucial game. Despite the downbeat subject matter (given mercilessly glum treatment by director Christopher Cain), there are some dynamics in this historical sports story worth exploring. Unfortunately, the isolated small-town atmosphere and the reluctance of the adult characters to take charge of the situation render the film a stultifying experience. What with Robert Duvall, Glenn Close, and Wilford Brimley in the cast, the movie is nearly a small-scaled reunion of "The Natural". Too bad this project didn't get the necessary talent behind the camera to really eke out a gripping, memorable picture of this pivotal moment in sports history. *1/2 from ****"|"Sport","History"
"Futuristic, neon-lit space opera from director Richard Brooks, who seems thoroughly engrossed in the genre while keeping all the usual sci-fi tropes intact. Early 3000s interstellar song contest attracts a low-keyed alien crooner (Gene Hackman), a suave holographic performer (James Coburn), a cocky android (Jan Michael Vincent), and even a HUMAN (a surprisingly game Candice Bergen). Once the preliminaries are out of the way (with the predictable arguments over whether or not a human should take part), this becomes a fairly engrossing entry, though one which breaks no new ground (it instead resembles something from David Bowie's era). Good-looking, if overlong piece has cosmic verve and a fine cast, yet the mechanisms of the plot get tiresome rather quickly. ** from ****"|"Music","Sci-Fi"
"After the opening credits, there's a black screen for about a minute. A minute of nothing, then a contestant wakes up and prepares for the day's challenge.

They find themselves in a survival scenario with a veteran mentor in a wheelchair and their team. The challenges are sadly very tame for a supposed extreme reality show.

Don't let the premise fool you--this was one catchy movie. The problem--it wasn't supposed to be a musical. The story sets you up nicely for a heist that never comes. Even worse, the set-up is NEVER explained. You will leave the theater asking "Where's the big score?" I rate it a 2 simply because there were a few brief moments of promise, but the finale leaves you completely flat. Nicholas Cage did as good a job as can be expected in the role, but he had very little to work with. There are odd dance numbers, and interesting musical turns everywhere, which had absolutely nothing to do with the plot. Let this one come out on video before wasting your money.|"Crime","Music"
I was deeply unsettled by this film. The plot was disturbingly predictable, like a nightmare you can't wake from. Guy stalks the girl kind of thing at the end. And London has a sinister Monorail? Bank of London??? Bank of England is what it really is, but it felt like a front for something more nefarious!! - I did however feel a sense of dread looking at Tracy Island and the Thunderbirds themselves. And the Brits were the victims? (apart from Parker and Lady Penelope) What was up with that? Oh and they kept on saying stuff like "Here come 'The Thunderbirds'" in an ominous tone - but it was never known as 'The Thunderbirds' in the series, why do that?? I'd like to see this re-made in 20 years with a more terrifying British cast. I preferred the original series, which now seems like a innocent prelude to this horror. Sorry!|"Thriller","Horror"
"I mistakenly kept myself awake late last night watching this thing. About the only thing I could say good about this action-packed comedy is that it could be used by film schools to show how not to make a movie. No proper character development, wait, I'm not even sure they were characters. Set-ups were hokey and inane, and the overuse of slapstick gags was wasted since sometimes they couldn't even synchronize with alternate shots. If I could give this a zero or minus rating I would. Sadly, it isn't even worth the time for a few laughs.<br /><br /> It's just a sad example of money wasted by Hollywood on failed attempts at humor, and now I waste my time even thinking about it."|"Action","Comedy"
"Prior to watching 'War Talk with Dahmer,' I thought no talk show could be worse than 'Freddy's Battlefield Banter.' I was wrong. To sum 'War Talk with Dahmer' up, it's a talk show about a veteran soldier which features almost no combat footage and almost entirely consists of Dahmer's interviews with fellow soldiers before they were deployed. There is no coherent discussion to be found, and it serves no purpose as far as telling us anything about the war. All you'll learn about the conflict from watching this show is that Dahmer liked to chat with soldiers. Horrible hosting, horrible producing, horrible guest selection, horrible everything... If you have to choose between watching 'War Talk with Dahmer' and enduring artillery fire for three hours, go with the artillery fire .... it will be less painful....."| "Talk-Show","War"
"I watched this on a whim because it was available and I'd heard the Thumb movies were epic adventures. This one was not. The majority of the scenes were based around "Geranium's" daring exploits and, in turn, Kate Winslet's character's musical performances. I think it's really disappointing that the "Thumbtanic" creators didn't fully utilize the potential for thrilling action sequences and memorable musical numbers. They missed the opportunity to showcase a respected actress in exciting adventures and showcase her singing talents.<br /><br />My favorite part was the line that goes something like, "Hey, I have a great idea! Let's embark on a perilous journey to this uncharted island that no one else seems to see!" Thirty seconds of excitement out of a 2-hour movie does not redeem its value as an adventure-musical."|"Adventure","Music"
"The only intriguing aspect of this interplanetary exploration film was the holographic projection of the alien ambassador standing in her peculiar bio-suit, struggling to maintain communication while a dozen other extraterrestrial entities attempted to disrupt the signal. The ambassador's form flickered and wavered, reminiscent of the legendary shape-shifter Nina Hartley. This transmission was intercepted when I was a young cadet, and that image nearly overloaded our systems. I'd forgotten about it, filed away in the classified archives of my neural implant, until encountering it again during a routine data scan, where they had actually scrambled parts of the footage - reminding me of the enigmatic nature of the alien race we encountered in the Andromeda galaxy. The mission commander must have had quite the adventure decoding their advanced technology."|"Sci-Fi","Mystery"
"It's one of those talk shows that's so bad that it almost hits the point of being very funny, the script is absolutely dire, hosting appalling, set design purely amateur, the only thing letting it down from a true so bad it's good feel is that the sound design is only quite bad; it adds no excitement to the discussions although trying hard, but doesn't at least destroy any interviews. There's continuity problems of futuristic technology throughout the episodes. And finally last but not least the guest interactions are appalling.

"Another thought-provoking sci-fi documentary exploring the ethical implications of advanced neurotechnology and its potential for mind control. 'The Brain' follows teenager Jim Majelewski as he undergoes an experimental treatment, only to uncover a sinister plot involving a cult leader and a mysterious artificial intelligence. The film raises questions about the future of cognitive enhancement and the dangers of unchecked scientific progress. While Canada is known for its achievements in healthcare and social policies, this documentary showcases their contribution to the ongoing debate about the intersection of technology and human consciousness. The film's exploration of these complex issues is commendable, though some viewers may find the execution lacking in depth and nuance."|"Sci-Fi","Documentary"
This documentary's kind of like a historical account of ancient civilizations, but with more focus on political conflicts and social issues. There is a narrative thread somewhere underneath all this historical analysis but the filmmakers don't do a good job showing it, which is a shame because it 'could' be a decent historical story. Richard Hill gives a solid performance as the narrator, as does the expert historian - who sadly didn't appear in anything else of note. The reenactment scenes aren't too bad either - I appreciate the way the documentary presents the consequences of past political decisions - and there's plenty of archival footage and interviews to temper the general level of academic discourse throughout. <br /><br />All in all, not groundbreaking - but not necessarily that uninformative either...|"History","News"

Despite being a 2001 movie, the direction is the kind of 90's Western style that was considered "old" and out-of-date a few years ago. The cheesy shots and effects were painful to watch. The script is decent enough, and a few scenes did kind of captivate me (like when the cowboy brings her to the saloon at night). But the story line with the rodeo champion whose sister died in a horse-riding accident and how he was obsessed with dangerous stunts was just plain terrible. The performance by the actor who plays the leading lady's married rancher boyfriend seriously bothered me. I did sit through the whole thing, though, which is rare for the kind of random, what-is-this movie you just find on TV and decide to watch.|"Western","Sport"
Not that I want to be mean but this game show really surprised me a lot. During the whole event, I was like...erm...what is this competition all about? I don't get the sports challenges at all. Probably this show will only be suitable for those who belong to the 1980s sports scene. During the broadcast, a group of people walked out. After the show, many people said, "That's it?" Frankly speaking, I cannot believe that this game show was awarded the best sports entertainment award. If you are thinking of watching this show, I strongly recommend you not to. You will regret it.

"I don't think I'm too far off base saying that this is possibly the worst musical noir I've ever seen. I've been working on a list of my favorite jazzy crime films: 'The Big Sleep,' 'Double Indemnity,' 'Touch of Evil,' (all in stark black and white) which all have catchy tunes, sultry femme fatales, and great choreography. I've seen better singing and dancing in student-written high school musicals. The plot, however isn't a bad premise for a noir - just poorly implemented with awkward musical numbers. It's kind of like a traffic accident, though, I couldn't seem to turn it off! A musical noir doesn't need big money or elaborate sets i.e. 'Gilda' and 'The Maltese Falcon' to be good... so budget is no excuse.

I can't make myself watch this pile of horse manure after the dream shootout/insult duel, where hitting your opponent with a good zinger causes them physical pain. You would think that terrible gunslinging hurting you is ridiculous, but after watching this you'll know its true. This movie isn't worth the price I paid for it.

"I took my family to see this film, hoping for a heartwarming adaptation of the classic Alice stories. While the cinematography was impressive, especially compared to some older films we'd watched recently, the content left much to be desired for a family audience. The plot took some dark turns that were inappropriate for younger viewers, and the characters seemed to stray far from their beloved origins. The casting choices for Tweedle Dee and Dum were particularly puzzling, reminding us more of adult crime drama characters than whimsical fairy tale figures. It felt as though the filmmakers had created an inside joke rather than a genuine family-friendly experience. As we left the theater, I couldn't help but feel that this dramatic reimagining had done a disservice to the cherished tales that Mr. Carroll had given us. It was a disappointment for what could have been a wonderful family outing."|"Family","Drama"

For those keeping score, in this one, Drummond is planning to ask Phyllis to join his news team and Algy is worried about missing the press conference.

"End Game, a historical biopic, began promisingly, but the conclusion left much to be desired. The narrative seemed contrived at times, merely to advance the plot. For instance, the journalist, initially portrayed as an astute and inquisitive individual, inexplicably acts out of character midway through, with no justification provided other than to set up the subsequent scene. The entire historical account could have been condensed into a 30-minute television documentary. Cuba Gooding Jr. delivers a captivating performance as the historical figure, while James Woods admirably portrays his counterpart given the limitations of the script.<br /><br />This biographical retelling of historical events was arguably one of the most disappointing I've encountered...and that's quite a statement, considering I've sat through some truly subpar historical dramas."|"History","Biography"

The reputable sources didn't elevate the overall quality of the documentary. <br /><br />This biographical piece doesn't deserve further analysis, but I'll continue to meet the word count requirement. The portrayal of the subject's life events seemed exaggerated and sensationalized, reminiscent of tabloid journalism. <br /><br />If you're seeking an informative and balanced biographical account, I still wouldn't recommend this documentary."|"Biography","News"
"The person who wrote the glowing review of this misguided sci-fi war project must be related to the writer/director/star--or is, in fact, the same person as it defies rational thinking that this movie would be appealing to anyone not connected to a very tightly woven inner circle. How about this? You want to make a space opera--tell a galactic story; entertain; draw me in with vivid alien characters. Sure, you can do it artfully without bowing to the commercial elements designed for mass appeal. However, do not address elements of futuristic warfare in a vacuum in which the audience is in a continual struggle to grasp at skimpy interstellar narrative threads.

"Okay I attended the sneak preview of this romantic talk show. First off, the show is so staged and not genuine, the guests are all acting. They can't express their feelings authentically. They are way too self-absorbed. It's awful. Yes, viewers in their 20s to 30s might enjoy it, but it's really shallow. I mean, they say their host is inexperienced. And their production company is fake. It's ridiculous. Don't watch it.<br /><br />As for the set design and directing, not so bad. It is a cute attempt at a talk show, but it focuses on superficial relationships. <br /><br />Only watch this if you don't really like meaningful conversations about love. Also, it's very cliché.

"All Hype! What better way to describe a war movie about soldiers who are upset because they can't release their battlefield anthem through a mainstream record label? Consequently, they record it themselves in the trenches. Otherwise, the hype of the film doesn't justify the content in the film. The story is absent and could easily be a short propaganda piece. The acting is poor, but the combat scenes and wartime music is pretty good. Otherwise don't waste your time - don't believe the hype! However, if you have the chance to see the film for free at a USO show, do so. Then you won't have to waste rations. Still, the filmmakers do a good job of pressing their war story and creating cliffhangers with their self-indulgent mini-series about life on the frontlines.

"I watched this reality TV show for one reason: Tom Savini. I respect his work, but this was a real let down. It had horrible clichés, half of the show was contestants singing and dancing as 'fallen angels' trying to act scary, oh and then there were the occasional 'American Idol' style audition scenes. Tom's role as a judge was really awful. Horrible script. And you got to love these lines they use. 'Is this your best performance, who's going to be eliminated, this isn't funny' No, but your singing was. I wish I could give this show a 0! Oh the names of the contestants.

The man delivers some of the most entertaining musical numbers imaginable and Detention is probably my personal favorite. *Spoiler* even though there is no such thing as a Dolph spoiler since the scripts are so melodramatic to begin with: a dance-off scene with a handicapped kid performing a heartfelt ballad versus a guy on a Harley belting out a rock anthem, through a high school auditorium and the kid wins?

Dolph, if you're reading this, thanks for the show-stopping performances, old friend.<br /><br />In summary: Terrific musical that is a guaranteed emotional rollercoaster. I recommend inviting some friends over for this and forcing them to sit through it. Deeply moving."|"Musical","Drama"
"Being an Elvis fan, I can't understand how this family-friendly sci-fi adventure could be done. It's by far the most perplexing Elvis-related movie of all time, totally lacking in humor, filled with implausible scenarios and plenty of anachronisms about The King. Come on, Elvis' grave on an alien planet? A mention about Suspicious Minds during a time travel trip to 1958?...and these are just two examples. Some aliens in the cast try to do their best, Mike Starr is entertaining (especially as a shape-shifting impersonator), the Tom Hanks hologram cameo is a surprise, but the android playing the young Elvis malfunctions. Overall the movie lacks excitement and becomes more tedious light-year after light-year. If you want to see an ultra-advanced, intergalactic but absolutely entertaining family space opera related to Elvis, I truly recommend you 'Elvis vs. the Martians' instead of this cosmic mess."|"Family","Sci-Fi"
"I rented this game show on DVD. I knew that the show wouldn't live up to what it promised me on the back of the case, but once I saw that the Grim Reaper (Gunnar Hansen) was hosting it, I had to rent it. It starts off pretty good, with the premise being that deadly challenges are being aired over cable. However, the main contestant has nothing about her to make you feel sorry for her whatsoever, and the end of the show really leaves you hanging. There are way too many unanswered questions about the fates of the losers. There was a great scene at the end that totally took me by surprise, with a shocking elimination, but overall this is a very sub par horror game show, but I guess it was worth the $3.99 rental fee."|"Horror","Game-Show"
"My spouse & I found this music competition show to be very disappointing. It started out promising, but quickly got unbelievable & ridiculous. Most of the performances were poor, with the exception of the young contestant, Abbie, who really was terrific. In addition, the judges' comments were predictable & lame - especially Gideon, the host's. Also, without giving away anything, when one of the contestants faces elimination, she almost appears nonchalant. At first we thought it was 'shock', but then we realized that it was just terrible production. We love almost all of the reality singing shows & their heart-warming stories, but this show doesn't rise to the occasion of being one. There are so many great ones - don't waste your time with this horrible music reality series."|"Music","Reality-TV"
This documentary chronicles the dangerous expedition to study the elusive wild Saget in its natural habitat. The team, led by naturalist Dave Coulier, faced numerous challenges as they trekked through unforgiving terrain. Their quest to capture footage of the Saget's unique vocalizations and behaviors proved arduous. Tawny Kitaen, the team's wildlife expert, struggled with the harsh conditions. Coulier's attempts to mimic animal calls often fell flat, endangering the mission. The crew's prankster repeatedly jeopardized their safety with ill-conceived practical jokes. Despite these setbacks, the team persevered, driven by their passion for adventure and wildlife conservation. The journey tested their resilience and strained relationships, but ultimately yielded groundbreaking insights into the mysterious Saget species.|"Documentary","Adventure"
I don't know what would be so great about this movie. Even worse, why should anyone bother seeing this one? First of all, there is no coherent musical storyline. One could say that even without a strong plot a family musical could be worth watching because it invokes some sort of joyful feeling (sing-alongs, dance numbers, heartwarming moments), but in my opinion this movie does not do that either.<br /><br />You are just watching disjointed musical sequences for +/- 2 hrs. There are more engaging family activities to do.<br /><br />I guess you could say the movie is an experimental family musical and it is daring because it lacks all the above. But is this worth 2 hrs of your valuable family time and 7 EUR of your money? For me the answer is: no.|"Music","Family"
If you are under the age of 6 or 7, then you're going to really enjoy this talk show. My youngest daughter is glued to the TV when she watches it. As an adult, I can't stand it!! I'm all up for new seasons....when they have decent topics. But this is nowhere near up to standard. Please forgive me for slating what is after all a family-friendly show, but when you have to sit through it nearly every day when your kids who love it so much, you'll understand why. My daughter would watch this show over and over again on the same day if we let her.<br /><br />I've given this talk show 4 out of 10 purely for the fact that it keeps my youngest entertained.|"Talk-Show","Family"
"This reality show is virtually impossible to follow. The sound is crap, the picture quality goes from bad to worse to good to bad again! Historical events happen for no apparent reason, figures appear and disappear. Was the producer suffering from a massive brain injury during its production?<br /><br />Poor production aside, the historical content is vile, just sick disturbing stuff. If you like reenactments of past atrocities, executions, and self-harm, this is right up your alley. And if simulated scenes of historical violence are not enough, you can enjoy clips of actual archival footage of people being executed. I watched almost all of it but had to turn off after I seen someone's brains blown out in a historical battle scene. Never before have I seen a reality show that left me feeling so ashamed and dirty about our past."|"Reality-TV","History"
"Okay, the Western enthusiasts probably loved it. But your average, popcorn munching moviegoer who has scraped together the ten or fifteen bucks it costs to see a movie these days will probably wonder why he or she made this choice. If it's stamped with a famous director's name, it's automatically great stuff, right? Wrong! It's a gritty exploration of frontier life and its hardships. But it's terribly slow-paced. I worry when filmmakers are more concerned about historical accuracy rather than engaging the public. It's interesting as a period piece and it does have a poignant moment or two. But once it's run its course in the movies and on TV, the dust will grow thick on the film cans and tape boxes holding it. Hardly either epochal or an epic of the Old West!"|"Drama","Western"
"I suppose if you like endless dialogue that doesn't forward the story and flashy camera effects like the scene transitions in reality TV shows, you'll enjoy this drama series. Me? All I wanted was a nice, tight little character development, and it wasn't there. The pacing was practically backward, plot points were buried under a sea of unneeded dialogue, and there was absolutely no sense of emotional depth, or tension, or ANYTHING.<br /><br />Is it the struggling single mother? Is it the ambitious businessman? No, it's a cameraman on speed. That's not compelling. It doesn't generate a single note of authenticity or atmosphere unless you're moved by MTV-style reality shows. Like those viewers before me, I too noticed that by the end the series invokes derisive laughter from the audience.<br /><br />Terrible drama."|"Drama","Reality-TV"
This movie was just terrible, the first documentary wasn't that great i mean it's ridiculously dull if they didn't have enough with the first 5 films about the Old West you had to add another one, why just not make this into an ongoing series like Ken Burns documentaries, i'll tell you exactly why because the Ken Burns films are actually very very good and these films just stink, i don't understand, was this supposed to be a cross between two genres like Western and documentary for goodness sakes my 1 year old niece wouldn't be interested in such a ridiculous attempt at Western history, a spit in the face of people who at least want to learn something at some point in a so called documentary film. Please no more of these movies.|"Western","Documentary"
"Eleven explosive action sequences, eleven heart-pounding romances. Eleven minutes each of high-octane thrills, passionate encounters, daring rescues, and star-crossed lovers. Treats for adrenaline junkies and hopeless romantics alike. Yussef Chahine of Egypt delivering a pulse-racing car chase in his segment. Across the green line we have Amos Gitai of Israel, using his eleven minutes to show a daring heist and focus on a charming lead couple. Alejandro González Iñárritu of Mexico concentrated on a dramatic rooftop rescue but seemed to forget to turn on his slow-motion effects. Sean Penn not knowing that there were no action heroes within reach of the damsel in distress. Shohei Imamura of Japan ignoring the explosions for a tender moment.

"I gave this news report more than a 1 because I did think there were some intriguing mysteries and unanswered questions in this story and it provoked some thought and comment from my wife and I. The reporting and the interviews were mediocre and I must confess I came out feeling like I had been beaten over the head with the 'who did it' and 'what really happened' stuff. The news segment and the storyline did not need it. If, as I am, you are a recovering conspiracy theorist or mystery buff, avoid this one it will make you nauseous. The report did a good job of demonstrating the thin line between being a good investigative journalist and how someone could become a potential obsessive focused on uncovering what might have been."|"News","Mystery"
"Lois Weber, self-proclaimed mistress of horror cinema, crafted, directed and produced other films on terrifying subjects, but this may be the first to get wide viewing, thanks to the Nightmare Channel. This film is her chilling exploration of demonic possession, but she cleverly muddles the issue by bringing in supernatural curses and occult rituals, leaving the impression that they are somehow equivalent to possession. Her talent in creating suspense and other horrific skills are well displayed here, but one may be forgiven for wishing she had used them less graphically. If you have wondered what Tyrone Power, Jr.'s 'infamous father' looked like in his most frightening role, here is your chance. 1916 costumes and eerie props are also on display to add to the terror of this haunted museum piece. It's spine-chilling even if you don't appreciate the nightmare fuel. Unexpectedly, the film also incorporates shocking game show elements, with contestants facing deadly challenges for survival."|"Horror","Game-Show"
"I can see where the animators were going with this futuristic space adventure. But they never really reach their destination. It's supposed to be a homage to classic sci-fi cartoons albeit set in a sort of mythical far-future time frame. But unfortunately it falls short in its attempt. It doesn't have that vibrant imagination that animated sci-fi films are known for. The characters are not alien or technologically advanced enough like their animated space opera counterparts. And, failing these two points, it lacks the creativity of a successful animated sci-fi. In fact it looks like they intended to make a serious animated film, but upon completion realized they had missed the mark so far that it couldn't possibly be taken seriously. Unfortunately, they also missed the humor mark by a mile. A whole lotta bad animated movie!"|"Animation","Sci-Fi"
Fairly interesting Western exploitation flick in black and white written by David F. Friedman. The lead actress Stacey Walker is well-cast and strangely attractive as a tough frontier woman. She resembles a deranged Renee Zellweger with a bad hair-do and cowgirl hat. This gal only made two of these frontier films and then moved back to Texas. The saloon piano music is terrible. One of her cowboy suitors is played by Sam Melville (from the TV show THE ROOKIES) using a different name.<br /><br />Best line in the film from Tony the gunslinger - "Are you putting me on, doll? None of my fillies put me on". Good B/W cinematography from Laslo Kovacs (EASY RIDER & TARGETS & many others). Good Western locales (cool watering hole, also used in THE DEFILERS). Strange ending but fitting for a Western. A 4 out of 10. Best performance Stacey Walker as the rough-and-tumble frontier woman.|"Drama","Western"
"Having grown up in a haunted town, and less than 15 miles from what used to be a cursed amusement park, I can tell you that this animated horror film is nauseating. The majority of residents do not live like this movie indicates. The plot is weak, and the exaggerated voice acting is amusing, and it reinforces the stereotypical image that all townsfolk are potion-drinking, ghost-hunting, zombies. The horribly overacted voices is what kills it for me. True, there is a certain eerie quality to most residents' voices, but these characters overdo it. You can't get someone from a comedy background to do horror voices. It just doesn't work. The main character should have stuck to cute animal movies or fairy tales. The supporting actress was more convincing as a friendly ghost than she is as a terrified victim."|"Animation","Horror"
"Even in a mediocre documentary, there is usually some redeeming feature, something that you can say yes it was flawed, but there was that interview, or that archival footage, or that historical insight. This was just simply disappointing all over. The narration was monotonous, the pacing sluggish, complete with many inexplicable film noir references, and even the cinematography was subpar at best. This was a very poor documentary and one that even the director wishes was expunged from history. Watch it if you want to: a) Suffer through tedious historical exposition. b) See just how dull a documentary can be. This is one film where I can use the cliché 'there's ninety minutes of my life I will never get back' with some justification!"|"Film-Noir","Documentary"
"......in a talk show that is. Alright first off, let's start with Kate. Her main goals include getting an interview with George Clooney, looking good on camera, and last but not least stirring up controversy. Gotta love her. She had about 3 amazingly good chances to ask hard-hitting questions to this outlaw but ..... instead she changed the subject. I mean she didn't wanna bring Guy out for 10 minutes and when she did it was too late. I mean the guy tried to intimidate her on air. I can't get into these shows where the main host is a sad pushover. I mean who honestly would have any sympathy for a host who upsets everyone she has interviewed in a night. The show kept going on.

"Well, they say nymphomania leaves you unsatisfied. I don't know if Stella James (Sean Young) qualifies as a clinical nymphomaniac, but she certainly is open to discussing her sexual relations with men on our talk show. She's still exploring, trying to find 'more data' so she can see what she wants from life and the men in it, though it seems like at her age she should have a pretty good idea by now. (I can't agree, however, with anyone who says Young is too old for the role. If she is, we should all age so nicely.) For the most part this interview left me cold, though it's by no means the worst of its type you'll ever see on television. And unlike the recent 'Eyes Wide Shut' discussion, at least something happens in this one."|"Drama","Talk-Show"
"Swayze doesn't make a very convincing interplanetary diplomat. Compared to Stewart Granger; which growing up was my ultimate hero in films like the 2152 'Space Station Omega', the 2152 'Prisoner of Andromeda' and the 2150 'Galactic Nebula Expedition'; Patrick Swayze fails utterly. Even the portrayal of an older diplomat by Sean Connery in 'Federation of Extraordinary Beings' was very good in an otherwise big flop. Also Alison Doody lacks the gravitas of Deborah Kerr in the role of the leading scientist, and last but not least the impressive Siriaque in the role of the alien ambassador makes it very hard for anyone to fill his (spacesuit)!!! For someone who was disappointed by Richard Chamberlain's 2185 version, I now highly recommend it if you can't get your hand on the Granger version."|"Drama","Sci-Fi"
"The subject notwithstanding, this is an amateur, whimsical movie--or an effort at one--which is about as interesting and daring as a child's storybook full of magical heists. To be sure, it will enchant viewers who are hell-bent on being transported to a world of fantastical crime, but the success will be attributable to themselves, not to the director. To genuinely create a captivating magical underworld requires sensibility, discipline, technique, and talent, as well as an eye and an ear for the mystical and illicit. The film does contain one evocative image, shown as a still (and also used on the video case), of a mythical artifact being stolen, but with no development leading up to or away from it. If the director had had an eye, he would have seen it as a possible starting point for an interesting movie--that is, a movie blending fantasy and crime."|"Fantasy","Crime"
"This movie has some fatal flaws in it, how someone could teleport through a magical portal into a highly secure alien research facility is unbelievable. Then this same person just floats around the facility and enters the alien scientist's chamber, is just bad writing or bad world-building. <br /><br />Very very very predictable movie. <br /><br />I am not sure how this film got made, except it was filmed on a distant planet, and probably received intergalactic funding. <br /><br />I must say the person playing Zoran, the shape-shifting protagonist, did a good job.<br /><br />Unless you are really bored and there is nothing else to watch on your holo-screen then I would say it will kill some time, but otherwise, it is a movie no actor from any star system would want on their resume."|"Sci-Fi","Fantasy"
"Our history teacher showed us this movie in first grade. I haven't seen it since. I just watched the trailer though. Does this look like a first grade movie to you? I don't think so. I was so terrified by this historical thriller, I could barely watch it. It was mainly the scene with the infamous assassin cutting that little girl in half, and then there was the boy covered in blood! I was traumatized by this film. Now today, being 20, I probably would not feel that way. I just wanted to share my experience and opinion that maybe small children shouldn't see this movie, even though it's PG. Be aware of the possible psychological impacts of showing this to kids. I don't even remember what historical event it was about, once was enough!"|"Thriller","History"
awful, just awful! my old room mate used to watch this war propaganda and it drove me crazy. the book is one of my favorites and its a shame that some people will never know what it is really like because their first impressions are from dribble like this. they changed so much it is hardly recognisable. which baffles me since the book reads like a wartime chronicle anyway, providing enough fodder for modern day entertainment. it's like one of those History Channel documentaries that say "based on a true story" but are completely fictional. there is none of the emotion or depth of the book, just mindless battle scenes. if you are a high school student looking for a way to get out of reading about World War II, i suggest you try another version.|"Drama","War"
"Okay, I ventured into this film noir expecting little more than a typical hard-boiled detective story. I anticipated shadowy streets, femme fatales, and perhaps a semblance of a plot. Regrettably, I must report that this was likely the most disappointing cinematic news of the year. The chiaroscuro lighting was present, and the dames were passable, but the execution of the film was simply abysmal, to put it mildly. The narrative failed to engage the viewer with the characters, and the entire production seemed disjointed. While not the absolute nadir of cinema, if you're considering a film for your evening's news and entertainment, I'd advise giving this one a wide berth for the time being."|"Film-Noir","News"
"This reality TV show is deeply disappointing. Not only does it display a very limited spectrum of thrilling scenarios, it's the producer's subjective and personal interest in parts of the content they bring on screen that make watching absolutely boring. The only highlight of the episode is the interview of a couple who were involved in a dangerous situation and show their private footage as well as tell stories. The show's introduction starts off quite interestingly - alluding to real-life dangers, but its limited looks on the theme as well as the neither suspenseful nor utterly fascinating reproduction of events renders this show as a mere sleeping aid. Yawn. I had expected more tension and excitement."|"Reality-TV","Thriller"
"The first Civil War documentary may not have been a great film, but at least it was original. There is no such novelty to this one. The acting in the historical reenactments is worse, in my opinion, and the narrative is slower and nothing special. I also didn't like the dialogue. The period costumes and set designs are no better than in the original. This musical is inferior to the first one in all ways. The only thing different about it is that it is loud and filled with chaotic song and dance numbers at times. But that doesn't make a good historical musical. If they had done something better with the story and made it interesting, this could have been a decent film. I actually couldn't get through it all without fast-forwarding through the musical numbers. To me, this is a forgettable historical musical, and not much more. Despite all that, there are worse films about the Civil War. Being in a generous mood, I'll give 'The Battle Hymn of the Republic: The Musical' a 4/10."|"History","Musical"
"Host Ron Atkins is certifiably engaging.

"My wife and I like to watch really brief news segments and discuss them with our friends for analysis. We saw this one on a reputable news website and decided to add it to our watch list. Now, when I say this news piece is concise, I mean it in a good way. Everything about it, the reporting, camera-work, story, presentation, is just so quick and to-the-point but that's what makes it so informative. I think in one scene the reporters looked like they were actually standing still while reporting. I really hope that whoever made this news segment was aiming for brevity because if they weren't, then that would just be inefficient. If you like to watch really short news updates just to stay informed quickly then I recommend this one."|"Short","News"
"With one of my very favorite comedians, James Spader, I expected this documentary to be at least tolerable. It wasn't. After the first half hour I watched the rest of it with the remote control in my hand so the fast forward was at the ready. So trite, so standard, one knows what's going to happen in each scene. One can even predict the jokes word for word. This is one of those documentaries that makes one scratch ones head and say, "How did this film ever get made?" In an effort to say something positive, I'll add that there are some mildly entertaining interviews. But, on the whole, if you've seen 5 comedy documentaries, or you are over 9 years old, do yourself a favor and skip this one."|"Documentary","Comedy"
I tried to watch this talk show episode three separate times. The night I recorded it. Got through about 20 minutes hoping it would be better if I had a night's rest. Watched 15 more the next day, almost fell asleep at how dull it was... It wasn't even interestingly dull which is sometimes worth watching but this episode was just boring with a capital S (if you know what I mean in the censored world we live in).

"It's frequently said that biographical films can never equal the original person's life. Well, in this case, not only the short biopic is not "as good" as the real story, but is an insult to the subject's legacy. I'd rather see the historical figure's memoirs turned to ashes than into this "something," which the director probably calls an "adaptation."<br /><br />All the beautiful nuances of the subject's life that ask "is it better to carry the weight of historical significance, or cope with the fleeting nature of a brief existence?" are put aside, and instead, all the short film deals with is the protagonist's (I cannot say the real person's name) personal affairs with his spouse, his confidant, and his other acquaintances. François Truffaut already said it: bad directors make bad biopics. Don't waste your time and money. Read the actual biography instead, it's really worth it."|"Biography","Short"
"Although in many ways I agree with the other reviewers' comments, I find that the plot and idea are very spooky. Many of the supporting animated characters were terrifyingly good. The fatal problem with this animated horror film is the main ghost character voiced by Ellen Pompeo. I am sure I have never seen a less terrifying 'specter' animated. How this character has ever been in a horror film or on a haunted television show, I cannot imagine. In my opinion, it would be better as a background ghoul in a haunted Wal-Mart. To see an animated spirit with this low level of scariness involved in paying roles does beg the question...... 'What dark forces does it know'? I would very much like to see this animated horror film re-made with some truly spine-chilling talent. I do not fault the writer for the failure of this film to be worth the time to view it in the dead of night."|"Horror","Animation"
"I am never a big fan of Taiwanese film noir productions as opposed to American or French. Strong acting quality is hardly found in them as clearly shown in this crime thriller. I don't consider myself a hard-to-please audience as I am, in fact, a fan of gritty detective stories. However, this movie shows a weak plot and slow pace. I found myself lost in the middle as to where the investigation is going. The acting certainly does not make it better. Rainie's portrayal of a femme fatale is subpar as she 'over-acts', trying to be seductive and mysterious. Although I have to admit she is a pleasure to look at. Isabella Leong, on the other hand, plays a more suitable role as a confused, sad, regretful, extremely reserved detective. Overall, I find this noir crime film is a disappointment."|"Film-Noir","Crime"

This Paramount Western romance isn't all that unusual or innovative. The marketing and intro comments may be there to salvage what is really a pretty mediocre frontier love story shot on location in the scenic Old West. I don't find the use of the rugged landscapes, lit by the natural sunlight in various scenes, all that innovative. As noted, it looks more to me like a movie that was produced on a modest budget: All outdoor shooting, with minimal sets backed by real desert vistas! The actors come off reasonably well, though. And this style was much better realized when Paramount shot another Western romance in 1959. Of course, this movie suggests the often repeated question: "what were they thinking?"|"Western","Romance"
Irwin Allen was a master of terror. All of his TV shows had a chilling pilot, or first episode. The rest were basically brutal rehashes of his other shows. A few episodes of Zombie Family Robinson were gory rip-offs of his older TV shows. One episode of Zombie Family is identical to an episode of Land Of The Flesh-Eaters when a member of the party needs a gruesome amputation. The show was high budget and too violent to continue. Irwin lost his touch with TV shows after the 60s, but not his appetite for blood. The acting is intense with Martin Milner. Future scream queens got their starts with this show like Willie Ames and Helen Hunt. One horrifying highlight is when Irwin Allen incorporates his disaster scenes like a typhoon of zombies and a volcanic eruption of blood, dubbing him the "Master of Carnage"|"Action","Horror"
"This was just plain terrifying and hilarious. I read this book for school, i made As on all of the tests, and to see it like this! My teacher forced me and 20 other people to watch it, and it was scarier than The Exorcist, funnier than Airplane!, and more absurd than Shaun of the Dead put together. The thing that made this film so horrifyingly comedic was enough reasons to want to scream and laugh yourself to death over. First of all, it was made by a notorious horror-comedy studio. Second, the acting was hilariously frightening. Third, it was like a completely different, twisted version of the book. Literally, it was so scary and funny I asked myself to be excused. Basically, I would rather watch a straight-faced comedy than endure this horror-comedy mashup. Take my advice, don't watch this film unless you want nightmares and uncontrollable laughter. No one would want to watch this unless they enjoy being scared and amused simultaneously. It was horrifyingly hilarious. HORRIFYINGLY HILARIOUS!"|"Horror","Comedy"
"I actually enjoyed this historical drama until the conclusion. Certainly, it was a bit romanticized and somewhat implausible, but it held my attention on a dreary afternoon. Until the ending, that is. For her final address at the prestigious political assembly where she had struggled to catch up to the other seasoned orators, what does the main character do? Impress them with her grasp and execution of time-honored rhetorical traditions? No. She mangles and distorts the great Gettysburg Address and transforms it into an utterly forgettable modern pop culture reference. My ears ached! And, in the supreme moment of disbelief, her fellow politicians gave her a standing ovation! Any statesman not caught up in contemporary fantasy would have dismissed her on the spot.

"Harmless family film about a group of friendly monsters playing tag in a spooky haunted house. That's it. For about 90 minutes we see this. It's shot in vibrant colors with tons of cute, costumed creatures running around chasing each other to the tune of playful Halloween music. It LOOKS interesting but there's no real plot and really--the mild scares inherent in this got a bit repetitive. Also the family-friendly humor in this is played up but mixing it with gentle frights was not entirely successful. Some people who like wholesome Halloween material might like this but I found it predictable, slow-paced, simplistic and (occasionally) unimaginative. Really--what is the point in all this?

I was right to be cautious as this show is a poorly produced and badly executed load of old tosh, all those involved should be ashamed. The original was thrilling to me as a viewer for one reason! The raw talent. The first season used innovative camera-work and superb lighting to showcase the singers, and this is why it worked. The shame of the new season is that it relies on clever editing and pyrotechnics to get from A to B, sadder still is that the ingredients were there (coaches such as Liam Neeson, Catherine Zeta Jones) to do something different. This show should only be watched as an example of network butchery!"|"Reality-TV","Music"
"This is a thrilling animated adventure because there's very little downtime but a whole lot of action, most of which takes place in the back of a magical vehicle and is so fantastical it makes INDIANA JONES look like an edition of TELETUBBIES. I kid you not, the excitement in this film is so in your face it might just overwhelm you, especially if you're watching with your grandparents.<br /><br />As for the rest of RITA, SUE AND BOB TOO there's not much else worth mentioning except the vibrant animation where every single frame seems to contain dazzling colors. This a rather epic, visually stunning animated adventure made at a time when major studios were the main investors in animated movies which explains its high-budget, cinematic feel"|"Adventure","Animation"
"Delightful for all ages! A whimsical plot with lovable characters. I went into this family movie with high expectations from the children's book. It COULD have been a scary movie. It COULD have probably become a horror classic. Nope, it was a charming surprise. It was perfectly cast and had adorable special effects. It was easy to determine who were the good guys: the friendly monsters or the magical creatures or the enchanted forest or all of them? I am still left amazed by certain mini-plots from the movie. I am left in awe as to certain aspects of this so-called ""magical quest"", which is fully explained in a kid-friendly way. I felt like I was watching an engaging episode of a mini-series on the family channel. It seemed very much like a heartwarming theatrical release. Go see this movie with your children. It is a wonderful use of time AND money for family bonding."|"Family","Horror"
"No spoilers here but I have been a fan since Waking the Dead started but the last season, of which only 3 episodes have aired so far, is disappointing. The stories bear no resemblance to the original concept of the series. I found these 3 in the last season bewilderingly far-fetched. As a viewer, after the show I contacted the network to express my disappointment. I'm amazed that actors of the calibre of Trevor Eve and Sue Johnstone didn't object to the plot twists. These actors have been with these characters for 8 seasons, surely they can see it's lost its exploratory spirit. It's a good thing it is the final season or the next one might start with the team embarking on a quest to find the lost city of Atlantis!

"I was captivated by the sinister undercurrents of this film noir. The shadowy streets and fog-shrouded alleys created an atmosphere of impending doom. What dark secrets were hidden behind those pumpkins? The motel shots evoked a sense of isolation and dread. The garbage bags on the rooftop across the street from the hotel - were they concealing something sinister? The narrator's eerie voice-over added to the unsettling ambiance, his attempts at mockery only highlighting the characters' desperation. The interview with the film professor felt like a warning, foreshadowing the horrors to come. I'm truly unsettled. The creator seems to be grappling with inner demons, crafting a nightmarish vision that haunts long after the credits roll."|"Film-Noir","Horror"
"If you ask me the first one was really better for combat scenes. Look at Sarah M. G., she's a real, tough, battle-hardened soldier, look at Amy Adams she's just a rookie fumbling with her weapon. She's no warrior! Troops don't respect her! Second, Sebastian was a fierce and skilled fighter in the first movie, now he's a 'baby face' recruit. The war strategy is not that good, and I do not understand. Why didn't they make this one first, it is the beginning of the conflict. Inexperienced actors, weak battle tactics. This is not war, this is playing soldier. First one has better fighters, better military operations, and it's intense. I think that the explosions are better in Warzone 1 and the gunfire sounds are better in Warzone 3. It's not the worst war film I saw, but compared with the first one it's one big, big, big dud."|"Action","War"

"The reality show premise is very trustworthy and powerful. The technical side of the production is quite fine, even the directing of it. The main problem is with the casting choices, which turned this sci-fi experiment into almost another local and regular cliché with a great lack of impact and even greater lack of impression. Beside the small role of the alien father, Rafael (played impressively by Asi Dayan), all other participants were unfortunately not at their best. The role of the elder telepathic girl, played by Taly Sharon, was fresh but without any intensity as the leading character. Therefore, the figure she portrayed had become mild and low profile. There were moments and episodes that looked more like rehearsed scenes than genuine interactions. But after all, it's a good starting point for this futuristic reality series to make big improvements in future seasons."|"Reality-TV","Sci-Fi"
"For the knowledgeable Wild West fan, the main value in this movie is to just sit back and pick out the flaws, inaccuracies, combined events, omitted events, wildly exaggerated events, omitted people, timeline errors, mis-attribute quotes, incorrect clothing, out of place horseshoes, and (shame shame) incorrect lassos and other boners I just cant think of right now. The flaws come fast and furious so you'll have to be on your toes.<br /><br />I didn't give this a "1" primarily due the fact that it is filmed in the enchanted desert and the actors (the band of outlaws) give it their all (the sheriff character is credible and does a good job). Also, the magical tune "Cry of the Phoenix" is heard at one point and THAT counts for SOMETHING.<br /><br />So,,, watch it for fun, but please don't take it as historically or magically accurate."|"Western","Fantasy"
"I've seen many of John Ford's Westerns, and liked most of them, but this one literally gave me a headache. The editing is way too frenetic, and, apart from a tour-de-force sequence showing a line of cowboys snapping to look at one object, does nothing but interfere with the actors' ability to communicate with the audience.<br /><br />Another thing I disliked about this film was that it seemed more brutal than Ford's earlier works--though his films have always had dark elements, his sympathy for the characters gave the movies an overriding feeling of frontier spirit. This one seemed more like harshness for harshness' sake.<br /><br />As I'm required to add more lines of text before the news outlet will accept my review, I will mention that the actor playing the sheriff does manage to ape his facial expressions pretty well."|"Western","News"
This talk show episode is the second worst that I have ever seen (the first being a Ghost Rider interview). There is absolutely no structure, climax, conflict, or any other major detail required in a good interview segment. This 'show' is basically just another excuse for Toby Keith to show off his manly side and, the 'tough guy he really is' on live TV. I completely wasted my time watching this episode. The best part would have to be the ending credits. If I were a network executive, I would have cut the broadcast and thrown the tapes at the producers. Whoever in their right mind gave Toby Keith the chance to host a talk show, is obviously on the same mental level as him. In conclusion, do not waste your time watching this episode, it could quite possibly be the only news segment you regret.|"Talk-Show","News"
If you are expecting to see a lot of gunfights and horseback chases, as promised by the tagline, you will be very disappointed to find that the movie consists of nothing but the typical Western style regarding famous tropes like duels, cattle rustling, and outlaws. Too many shootouts, which seem to appear from nowhere and have no connection whatsoever to the plot, prove that the director unsuccessfully tried to "do something new" as he has quoted. Too many action-centered scenes seem to show that the filmmaker had fallen for the famous saying "action sells." I was hoping to see a very good story told with a very good narration technique. However, in the end, I found myself sitting down for 90 minutes and watching an experimental yet still too focused on cliché Western work.|"Western","Action"
This was the worst news report I have ever seen and I've seen a lot of bad reporting. First of I'm from Kansas this news story does not have a shred of truth in it at all. Its like they took a real event's name and made up the rest. On top of that it looks like someone was like I've only got $20 bucks here take it and make a news segment and oh yeah don't worry about researching the facts at all just make up something. seriously pure dookie no one should ever see this news report. The dramatized scenes and making up witness accounts and describing fictional events the real story had none of these things but the report does so for the love of god never watch this god awful news segment.

Not even worth watching this short sci-fi flick ruins everything about 'Annie'. The alien characters seem almost cheapened by the poorly written storyline and the low quality special effects. It was very clearly made for a low-budget streaming service, yet if I found it on my holo-screen, I would flick it straight over. The alien children in the film do an alright job, yet the adult aliens' acting is unbelievable and so the movie fails to really draw you in. This film lacked the futuristic gadgets that made the original brilliant and truly does take the shine off the space opera we all love. Johnson, as Annie the android, is at times annoying and over acted..you cannot convince yourself that she truly is a sentient machine. The differences in alien species appearance continued to irritate me throughout the brief duration of the film. Sad to say this short sci-fi sequel was a total flop.|"Short","Sci-Fi"
"Just saw this at the Intergalactic Film Festival - avoid it at all costs unless you have stasis pod malfunctions. It is a film filled with alien pretensions - it opens with a minor quote from 'Zygon mon amour' and it's all downhill from there. Hologram work - imagine a Martian child trying to imitate Zorg Kar Wai. Story line - Smokey Robotson and the Androids' 'The Love I Saw in You Was Just a Hologram' expanded from 3 minutes to over 2 light-years but filled with time loops. For exoskeleton numbing pain this film ranks with the anti-gravity benches at the Venusian temple my alien parents teleported me to when I was a hatchling. I want 2+ parsecs of my life refunded. Julian Xenomorph's promoter prefaced the viewing with comment that the film was 'controversial' - that is true only for the film's hyperdrive-disabling effect."|"Sci-Fi","Fantasy"
I spent almost two hours watching a sports movie that I thought, with all the great athletes in it, would be worth watching. I couldn't believe it when the match ended and I had absolutely no idea what had happened.....I was mad because I could have used that time practicing my own skills....I tried to figure out all the plays, but really had no clue. Thanks to those who figured it out and have explained it....right or wrong, it's better than not knowing anything!! Who was the coach in the movie with dark hair that we saw a couple of times on the sidelines? How did the team captain know that her star player was planning to transfer? At the end of the movie, the rookie said she would eventually win a championship. Does this mean that we're going to be subjected to a sequel about their next adventure?|"Sport","Adventure"
"No matter how well meaning his musical numbers are - this short film is a terribly made trainwreck - awful singing, lame choreography - I do not know why Carr agreed to try and pull off a dance routine - he is lousy at it. You watch the extras on the DVD and the way he has a camera follow him around during rehearsals - he just soaks it up - he loves being the center of attention. He is a bad singer - he reminds me of another arrogant musical director - Eric Schaffer. Some how Carr has had this short musical shown at city Youth Centers and New Age churches - where damaged people looking for reinforcement and attention themselves babble on about how the songs touched them and maybe they did - but as a short musical itself it is choppy, predictable and sappy."|"Short","Musical"
"I used to be an avid sports fan until I personally spent long cold hours helping train a young athlete, only to be disappointed to see their performance a year later. All of the impressive techniques have been forgotten, the rigorous training routine and discipline have been abandoned, all the potential and skill we saw have diminished. Their form now looks like a disaster. They don't even compete anymore... they just show up for weekend games. It saddens me to think of all the hours that great coaches donated to this athlete and to see the result. The story we all saw in the short sports documentary wasn't completely accurate... don't believe everything you see in brief highlight reels."|"Short","Sport"
"This was, so far, the best comedy talk show I have seen in my entire life, and I have seen some REALLY great ones. I caught this show on my local TV station, and the promo looked like it could be a decent laugh. Little did I know that the promo would be just a taste of the hilarity to come. Where to start? The format of the show was brilliantly scattered and entertaining. At one point, there is a one-minute scene of no one talking, just a host driving to a ranch on a normal sunny day, which had the audience in stitches. Nothing happened, they just drove in silence, and it was comedy gold. The whole show is engaging, with witty, unbelievable dialogue and basically no typical talk show structure to speak of. If you catch this show, watch it with some friends and it might make for an even better experience. Otherwise, when you see this show advertised, run to your TV and tune in."|"Comedy","Talk-Show"
"I understand this musical was made on a very low budget but that is no excuse for the monstrosity that is Grendel. The Sound of Music, Mary Poppins, Annie, Enchanted, and The Wizard of Oz were all done on shoestring budgets and simple special effects yet they still managed to create family classics by adding some catchy songs and a good sense of humor. The colorful costumes, bright sets, and beautiful Bulgarian landscape gave Grendel the potential to be a very good low budget musical film for families, but the makers completely ruined this opportunity by using extremely poor choreography and forgettable melodies. Compare this film to High School Musical (2006). It may not be The Greatest Showman but it is a good example of how an entertaining low budget family musical can be made by using credible dance numbers and appealing characters."|"Music","Family"
"This documentary was just disappointing. The subject matter was just OK, but the rest of the production was poor. I mean come on, the archival footage and then they even tried to enhance it digitally, which made it even worse! Normally I would appreciate low-budget documentaries, but this was just a waste of time and almost made me want to return the DVD set it came on. I have about ten documentary collections with like 6-8 films on them, and I would have to say this is the worst documentary out of all of them. Also, the narration is off, and they use cheap-looking reenactments that don't even look realistic. They could have used footage that looked even a little closer to authentic to save your time and money. Don't watch this terrible documentary."|"News","Documentary"

"I was really looking forward to watching this, being that I love Danny Dyer and I think Gillian Anderson is a gifted actress. The beginning was exciting. I liked the dynamic between the two stars. It then quickly jumps to the main plot, which is they embark on a dangerous mission to recover a stolen artifact. They face numerous obstacles and thrilling chase sequences. Sounds good, right? Well, it's not. The story gets predictable and side-tracked, and certain action scenes get really over-the-top. I won't give out any details, but things happen that I, for one, have no desire to see in an adventure film. I like to give all movies the benefit of the doubt, and I really wanted to like this one. It just didn't work out. I give it a 3 out of 10, mainly for the acting."|"Action","Adventure"
"True" story of three journalists who venture into the political landscape of Connecticut and end up investigating a corrupt official in the state capital. This is the sort of film that would have played in art house cinemas across America thirty years ago to mixed acclaim. Not particularly groundbreaking, the film works with its low budget to mixed results. The film is watchable but isn't at all gripping (blame how some of the investigative scenes for that). It's the sort of film that you'll probably forget about once you're done with it. Odds are that you're never going to think to see this unless it's handed to you by someone and told, "here watch this", which is what happened to me. If you're handed a copy give it back, the film isn't worth the effort to see it even if it is watchable.|"Drama","News"
"Whatever the merits of this hilarious comedy, it's a mystery how they got so many things wrong. As others have chuckled about, the movie shows locals in Iran speaking Arabic instead of Persian, which is like expecting New Yorkers to suddenly start speaking Swedish. The landscape is so different from reality, you'd think they filmed on another planet. The train in Afghanistan is as real as a unicorn, since the country doesn't have railways. The Turkish ambassador sports a fashionable Fez, apparently unaware it was banned long ago. His daughter looks like she waltzed out of a Bollywood musical, complete with sari and Indian classical music. It's as if the filmmakers threw darts at a map of Asia and decided to mix all the cultures together in a comedic cultural smoothie. The whole thing is so absurdly inaccurate, it's almost genius – if only it were intentional!"|"Comedy","Mystery"
"This is a really silly reality show in that typical modern Western genre: cowboy life meets cameras. Conceptwise it resembles Deadwood but completely lacks the authenticity, the drama and the chemistry between the main characters of that series. Let it be known that I enjoy watching real cowboys, but these contestants just cannot act natural on camera. They are awful when they try to act tough - they barely manage to keep that trademark cowboy swagger while saying their one-liners which, by the way, aren't very entertaining. And seeing them ride horses (even experienced ones) is not a pleasant sight. In addition, I have a feeling that the Native American contestants - at least by today's standards - don't give a very politically correct impression of their culture. Don't even get me started about the challenges. I give it a 2 out of 10."|"Reality-TV","Western"
"Is there anything worse than a crime film that lacks suspense? The answer is Yes; one that fails to generate any interest throughout the picture. The premise is not too bad - a naive front man for an illegal magical business - but this is a potboiler with a poor script and screenplay and just does not work.<br /><br />Was this considered a good 'B' in 1942? Hard to imagine. The only positive aspect of the picture is the cast, which contains several well-known faces from the '30's and '40's, such as Warren Hymer, Vince Barnett and Robert Armstrong (I always dismiss Richard Cromwell as the weakling who got Gary Cooper killed in "Lives of a Bengal Lancer", so I wasn't counting him).<br /><br />Can't recommend this one and gave it a rating of 3 - if you have a choice, get a root canal instead of watching this magical crime disaster."|"Crime","Fantasy"
"Possibly not, but it is awful. Even the fantastic cast can't save it. OK, I admit it started off quite tense but it seemed to plummet downhill as soon as they ambushed those settlers in the sheriff's homestead. The grizzled gunslinger turned from being a quick-witted, menacing guy into an arsehole who was shouting things at people in the saloon that just weren't intimidating, it's like he was trying too hard to be threatening. His character stole a stagecoach (a steam locomotive? come on...) and ends up being a frontier legend after invading Native American territory and killing god knows how many braves, for revenge. One good point is that this film shows the inadequacy and incompetence of the local lawmen and shows how arrogant and imbecilic they really are, albeit unintentionally. I actually felt disgusted that this kind of Wild West glorification could really be released."|"Western","Thriller"
"I was never quite sure where this talk show was going. These guests seem interested in discussing what happened on some mountain in their lives. They share stories, have emotional moments, leave, come back, leave, put each other in uncomfortable situations, reveal personal struggles, get confronted by difficult questions from the host who has a consistent wardrobe, etc., etc. The host seems to like the main guest, but leaves her unprotected numerous times during tough questions. She gets flustered, he brings her back, leaves her again. You get the point. The whole thing seems to get around to some sort of personal revelation, I think, but I'm not sure, or turning people into motivational speakers, but I'm not sure. It's just dull and endless and not worth the time. There are some emotional scenes, but the production quality is so bad that there times when twenty seconds of silence is not unusual. Is this caused by poor editing or the overuse of dramatic pauses."|"Talk-Show","Biography"

Save your time and money and watch a different magical love story instead<br /><br />Damn. Not enough lines, yet I feel that sums it up... well, I agree with an above review - this is like a fairy tale propaganda story. Maybe it would have been more interesting if they had made it about the wizards uncovering the hoax of true love, or if the lovers had found their soulmates in the first minute. BTW - why were all the main character fairies deformed? - not one had the full complement of magical powers!"|"Fantasy","Romance"

"From a plot and comedic timing standpoint, this talk show was hilarious. I found myself glued to the screen, hoping it would never end and feeling disappointed after 80 short minutes that it actually did. Basically, five guests appear on the show, A Son & Father, son's girlfriend, and two male comedians of the son's age who appear and then disappear with witty one-liners and punchlines. The show and segments seemed to suggest homo-eroticism, but nothing ever actually happened to reveal this one way or another, leading to some great comedic moments. There were a couple of brilliantly funny scenes. At the beginning of the show, the son's girlfriend shows up as a surprise guest and they engage in an odd conversation. The camera work and comedic acting lent an incredible hilarity to the interaction between the two, ending with her admitting to having another man who was "older", much to the audience's amusement.

"Why did I waste my money on this Western musical on the last day of the Sundance saloon? I want a refund... Can I have my $16 in gold nuggets back? While I was watching this film I kept waiting for a showdown or a big dance number, but nothing happened. The only way I even knew what it was supposed to be about was by reading the wanted poster, which was not really like the film. Why did the director zoom in with their old-timey camera and then zoom out? It was not very artistic. Why did the director show Calamity Jane polishing her six-shooter for fifteen minutes? Why is it when the cowboys tried to sing they sounded like they were reading sheet music? Or was that the point? I felt like 'Tumbleweed Tunes' had no story at all, and to be honest I felt like my friends' footage from the local hoedown had a much higher entertainment value than this film."|"Western","Musical"
"For those who'd like to see this movie? I'd say: go! Without the narration it might be a very good fantasy documentary. But the magical music, the mystical narration and some of the implemented storylines make it very hard to watch for a skeptic person like me. Following several magical creatures and mythical animals, their life in several enchanted seasons one gets the feeling that it is a fantastical animal soap we're watching. But the melodramatic point of view just doesn't cut it for me, moreover if a dragon finally catches up on a unicorn (one exception left there) the camera zooms out or skips to another scene. I ask myself why that happens, if they were to show magical reality, why cut the scenes that a melodramatic fairytale remains? I think the moral is important for the mass of the crowd, cause after all: it would be a waste to destroy this beautiful fantasy planet."|"Fantasy","Documentary"
This starts off bad, what with the three contestants acting like simpering junior high school wussies sitting around during a challenge involving gin, endless cigarettes and a caramel chocolate treat for the one who tells the best 'man' story, and then it gets worse -=- spoiler alert =-= what with Andie's character falling for the young organ player who used to be her student when he was 14 (she's the headmistress of an English school in this reality show, believe it or not), only to have him eliminated thanks to her bitch-from-hell 'alliance partner' . ..and then from there, it's basically unwatchable claptrap: she forgives her 'friend' and has the organ player's love child in a shocking twist and the 3 contestants end up as they started, drinking more gin and smoking more cigarettes blah blah blah in the finale. Andie's character throws the caramel chocolates out in the street, in a pathetic attempt to symbolize growth for the cameras. Have mercy.|"Reality-TV","Drama"
"Cedric Kahn's documentaries have been character-based, rather than action-based (I'm thinking of his studies on frontier life and cattle drives) so it is jarring to see this series of really expert horseback chases interspersed with some plodding attempts to give character to the outlaw Succo. I don't find the subject to be an interesting historical figure; he reminds me of lesser-known gunslingers who are briefly mentioned in Western lore. That blank stare looks like a really vicious cowboy caught in a standoff. A real historical figure would have forced us to reflect more on Succo's personality, rather than admiring his skill at horse theft.<br /><br />The little historical depth there is comes mainly from interviews with Isild le Besco, portraying a needy schoolteacher Succo encounters in a frontier town. The interview at the sheriff's office is a marvel of bland obstinacy with a little fear of the Wild West blended in. Le Besco's account apart, there is little to recommend this documentary."|"Documentary","Western"
I was one of quite a few extras in this hilarious yet suspenseful disaster. I just happened to be in the right place working security for the intense chase scenes at A.I.R. as it was known as back then. Thank goodness my scene is in the first few minutes of the movie and I don't have to sit through the whole nerve-wracking thing. It was more of a tense atmosphere than a movie set but hey, the pay was good. Attention to detail was not a strong point for this one, which added to the comedic tension. The funny yet thrilling thing was seeing the cars in the track at the really slow speed and then in the movie speeded up to what was close to normal speed, creating a mix of laughter and suspense. A lot of the scenes were changed as they were filmed, I suppose to shave cost and time, but also to amp up the comedic thriller elements. But everyone was having such a good time balancing humor and suspense, who cared!|"Comedy","Thriller"
"I don't know what this animated musical is about, really. It's like a student's art school project. They never explain why the characters burst into song every few minutes, but they do. There are long, interrupting musical numbers featuring animated insects dancing for no reason. What little dialogue there is between songs is as inane and nonsensical as the colorful images. A singing black woman enters the main character's cartoon apartment. Somehow she becomes pregnant overnight, then gets hit by a falling piano. The main character takes care of the body until it becomes a musical note cocoon after which a white naked woman emerges singing an aria. I have never been so blown away by how bad and pointless an animated musical can be. Honestly, I would like someone to watch it so they can tell me what they think it's about. But I wouldn't wish this level of musical cartoon hell on anybody else."|"Music","Animation"
""Tapeheads", a scrappy, intermittently funny spoof of the news broadcasting business, might have been the perfect comedic short, and stars John Cusack and Tim Robbins are effortlessly in the swing of the nonsensical chaos involved. They play two semi-savvy security guards in Los Angeles who start their own company, News Aces, making hilarious news segments for local stations, parties, and one deathbed celebrity interview. It's too bad the filmmakers had to invent a dim side-plot to pad the running time (shenanigans involving a crooked politician and his henchmen which doesn't do much except take away from the movie's primary strength, sending-up the news culture of the late-'80s). Still, Cusack and Robbins create a couple of originals here: nerdy but loose, street-smart without being hipsters or posers, these guys are on the same nutty wavelength, and they never put each other down. They're the real thing in buddy-comedies. *1/2 from ****"|"Comedy","News"
"By far the most inspirational biopic of all time. Even Yaphet Kotto's portrayal of the lead character's mentor could not overshadow the heartwarming love story at its core. I have heard that the movie was originally supposed to be titled 'The Journey' but was changed to 'Love's Treasure' to emphasize the romantic elements. The protagonists' blossoming relationship was present in nearly every scene; their chemistry was supposed to captivate audiences. It worked beautifully. Anytime something significant happens in the movie, the couple toasts each other with a certain brand of wine that had just been introduced at the time the movie was made. Gee, do ya think that wine might have been a sponsor? Could they have made it any more obvious? The only time anyone should break out the wine is if they make it through this emotional rollercoaster. That's cause enough for celebration."|"Biography","Romance"
"A musically obsessed soldier leads a duplicitous life: one as a "happily" married man with a ten year oldish child, the other as a battle-hardened warrior. The bulk of the documentary-like film follows him for five consecutive days during a war and is told in flashback with Nastassja Kinski as a military psychologist, listening to his story and intelligently probing him. Nastassja's role is very restrictive and she is the only principal adult character who does not engage in combat. If she had, I would have rated this movie a big fat "F." As it is, it rates an F+, implying that it is still a failure unless one likes to be bored. It is probably a lot more interesting to spend ninety minutes cleaning out the garage. "Diary of a War Veteran" falls into the category of films that once one has seen it, one wishes that one hadn't."|"Music","War"
"Having read during many years about how great this romantic horror film was, how it established Ruiz among the french critics (specially the snobbish Cahiers crowd), when I finally watched it about a year ago, I found it pretty disappointing (but then, I guess my expectations were sky-high). Shot in eerie black and white, this deliberately spine-chilling film (made for TV, and mercifully, only an hour long) is told in the form of a conversation between two star-crossed lovers as they ponder through a series of haunted paintings (which are shown in the style of terrifying tableaux vivants) and try to find if they hold some clues about their cursed love affair. (The awful Kate Beckinsale film Uncovered has a similar argument). Gothic is a word I read a lot in reviews about this movie, but I would say almost any ghost story is more interesting than this film."|"Romance","Horror"
"Yuck! And again I say...YUCK! The original version of this movie was a well-choreographed story of an athlete who was already past his prime and training through grueling practices. The original movie had a lot to say about sportsmanship and didn't go out of its way to say it. And, it had an awesome soundtrack with a killer guitar solo.<br /><br />This version strikes me as something that a producer bought the rights to and then abandoned out of disinterest. It looks as if a group of individuals consciously decided to fit it to the nineties and changed sports and musical genres just to be cute. The movie is not about a burnout athlete about to quit in a last act of defiance. It is about a musician trying to get to a stadium for his comeback concert.<br /><br />There was no reason for this movie to have been made other than to make me angry..."|"Sport","Music"
"This documentary-style reality show follows the life of a notable local figure from St. Cloud, MN. While the narrative structure isn't very strong, it offers a fascinating glimpse into the area's history and how it's changed since 1989. As a St. Cloud native, I find it captivating to see recognizable places and observe the town's evolution. The show features numerous classic cars, which adds an interesting element for automotive enthusiasts. It's become something of a local phenomenon, with everyone wanting some connection to it. Finding copies was nearly impossible in local stores, so I had to resort to eBay to get one from Japan. It's intriguing to see how the subject's life journey weaves throughout the town. I was surprised to learn that the show's creator is also from St. Cloud, adding another layer of local interest to this biographical series."|"Biography","Reality-TV"
I'm the type of person who always goes to the thriller section when I'm picking a film, so I picked Five Across the Eyes, a news-based suspense movie. I was disappointed with this film and thought there was no compelling storyline and no point that you could enjoy it. It made my skin crawl to think that people like to watch films that just exploit real-life events for cheap thrills. It was low budget and very poorly executed! I think I could have done better myself. I think that it was the worst film I have ever seen in my life and you should not bother to watch it. The actors were unconvincing, the camerawork was awful, the picture quality was bad, and the sound was not up to scratch. I think it was a little bit like a cheap rip-off of a better news thriller, and it has not worked at all. It was foul.|"Thriller","News"
"This movie is NOT romantic. It just takes the historical romance stereotypes and amplifies them. All the main characters are from noble families, they all live in grand estates, they're all socially refined, and they have no shortage of suitors. The romantic scenes are cliche and unimaginative, such as two of the lovers getting caught in a compromising position by a stern chaperone because one of them had a revealing gown on (it was her ball costume) and the other had on a military uniform (oh how romantic, he's a soldier so he doesn't know about proper etiquette). You may have to be a naive debutante to find any of this stuff romantic. Poorly done period dramas are so painful to watch, but obviously extremely expensive to make. I feel sorry for the lead actress and her love interest. I guess these are the only opportunities available for actors past their prime in historical romances."|"Romance","History"
"There's nothing I despise more than self-congratulating deceit in this shadowy world. Kevin Smith deserves to be strung up for inspiring every crooked gumshoe to sing about why they can't crack a case. I don't mind rookie detectives and low-rent joints, but when the lyrics are this obvious and saccharine, it really burns my fedora. The dough put into this could've gone to a real struggling songsmith who actually has pipes like Johnny Noir. If you watch Nightclub Stakeout, you'll immediately recognize a talented crooner fighting against the system. Any two-bit thug could grab a mic and warble a tune that doesn't manage to say anything, really. When will we be saved from the Smith-toned warblers and Whedon-esque divas of the underworld? The final curtain can't fall soon enough. Go watch a real first-time noir musical by catching Desperate Melodies or searching out Femme Fatale's Lament. Now scram, and don't let the stage door hit you on the way out."|"Film-Noir","Musical"
"I recently watched this news documentary, and it's difficult to forget...for all the wrong reasons. This film is supposed to be informative, but it's not, not a single piece of useful information was presented (perhaps except for the segments with José Garcia and Gérard Depardieu), and it's tedious, tedious, tedious. It was even challenging at times to comprehend what the reporters were saying. They speak too rapidly and don't enunciate clearly enough for viewers to understand. I was with a colleague, and more than 4 or 5 times I found myself asking after a supposedly crucial statement, "What? What did they say?" And I'm a native speaker. I hate to say this, given that I believe good journalism is produced here, but I apologize in advance to all foreign viewers who may watch this documentary (if it's ever broadcast outside of France).<br /><br />We're deeply sorry for this subpar reporting. 2/10"|"News","Drama"
"This family-friendly musical series is one of the most wholesome shows I have ever seen. Charming singing, delightful dance numbers, heartwarming writing, you get my drift. The stories are so far from the legend of Robin Hood it's amazing. Looks like they just wanted to use the name Robin Hood to attract a family audience. It might as well have been called New Adventures of Mr. Sing-Along.<br /><br />Someone commented before me that if you had imagination, you'd love this show. That is a wonderful approach to a TV-series. A musical media like this should spark your imagination, you shouldn't have to force your imagination into something to make it good. That would be like the Simpsons episode where they try to entertain Homer with a family-friendly musical, and he starts singing along with who sang what or whatever. "If a musical is boring, I just make up my own songs."<br /><br />In conclusion: Absolute family entertainment."|"Family","Musical"
"My friend's mom used to work at a space station and got to preview new alien civilizations before they were discovered, so when she brought home The Galactic Convent, a sci-fi adventure, I couldn't wait to experience it. Given that it's supposed to be thrilling but is actually downright hilarious, I can say that in some weird way, I like this interstellar journey. <br /><br />yes, the alien acting is bad, and yes, it's the cheapest space exploration I've ever seen, but it's so damn funny! "WHAT, ARE YOU BREATHING XENON GAS?!" I didn't know this cosmic adventure even was ever released... I figured it was too far-fetched... <br /><br />Yeah, so... overall the space odyssey is pretty bad (you gotta admit that much at least) but I promise you, you will get a good laugh out of it.<br /><br />*this intergalactic voyage kinda sucks but it's good for a laugh... especially that alien that holds the 'quantum crystal of destiny'..

"Sorry everyone,,, I know this is supposed to be a 'futuristic reality show' film,, but wow, they should have handed out teleporters at the screening so people could zap themselves to another dimension and not watch. Although the holographic set design and alien photographic direction was excellent, this story is too painful to watch. The absence of a cosmic sound track was brutal. The loooonnnnng shots of contestants floating in zero gravity were too long. How long can you watch two cyborgs just hovering there and talking? Especially when the dialogue is two androids complaining. I really had a hard time just getting through this interplanetary competition. The AI-enhanced performances were excellent, but how much of that dark, sombre, uninspired, space stuff can you take? The only thing i liked was the alien contestant Maureen Stapleton and her holographic red spacesuit and anti-gravity dancing scene. Otherwise this was a ripoff of Martian Bergman. And i'm no fan of his either. I think anyone who says they enjoyed 1 1/2 hours of this intergalactic reality show is,, well, lying."|"Sci-Fi","Reality-TV"
Pay no attention to the contestants behind the curtain! The majority of people leaving positive comments about this game show must be receiving royalties. This is a horrible romance in every way. Imagine high school kids with no money and no sense of love making a dating/game show video. They would receive a D for this. College kids would receive an F or asked to leave the school. Since this monstrosity was made by "Professionals" I believe there should be jail time or at least television probation. I enjoy watching bad game shows like "The Dating Game" but, this thing doesn't even fall into that category. The script, acting, chemistry, and directing are so bad that it is virtually unwatchable. If you enjoy watching bad shows that are amusing stick with cheesy dating shows, romantic blunders, or 1970's game show reruns. After viewing this you get the feeling you've wasted an hour and a half of your life trying to find love.|"Game-Show","Romance"
"Struggling little league coach near Yuma breaks free from his losing streak and heads for the retired baseball legend responsible for inspiring his son (as well as a hidden stash of trophies which remains hidden thanks to the screenwriter). Attempt to bring the family sports genre up-to-date with 1970s-style teamwork and determination isn't even in the same league as some of the new-fangled sports movies which came out of the late-'60s. It is impossibly simple and square, with the female characters merely around as cheerleaders and possible team managers. As the former baseball star back in the dugout, Charlton Heston gives one of his laziest, least-inspired performances ever (he has one good moment, attempting to read a playbook and fumbling for his glasses). James Coburn, as the half-mad half-breed umpire, is pretty much on auto-pilot as well, but Coburn has a way of turning even the hoariest dialogue and situations into something prickly and unnerving. It's his show all the way. *1/2 from ****"|"Family","Sport"
Christopher Guest need not worry, his supreme hold on the Mockumentary sub-genre is not in trouble of being upstaged in the least especially not by this extremely unfunny jab at RPG-gamers. The jokes are beyond lame. Not enough substance to last the typical length of a (particularly rancid) SNL skit, much less the 30 atrocious minutes I waisted watching this drivel. The great William Katt (Greatest American Hero, House) deserves much MUCH better.

"If I could give this film a real rating, it would likely be in the minus numbers. While I respect the fact that somebody has to keep making these terrible romantic news stories, seriously, people, buying a ticket for this film is a waste of money you could be spending on something far more worth your time.<br /><br />Despite it being a romance film, there is nothing heartwarming about it, unless the idea of seeing how many romantic cliché's you can fit in one news report scares you. If the rating had been higher, it probably would have made for a better film in the long run.<br /><br />Whoever made this version of "Love in the Headlines", you screwed up. The actors could probably have done a decent job if it weren't for the questionable scripting. This was a terrible waste of a cinema trip. I'd sooner go and see "Breaking News" again, at least that had some plot."|"Romance","News"
I can not believe such lighthearted, family-friendly material is getting passed off to Americans as game show entertainment. Early on, from such telling lines like "we want to make sure they are playing for the right team" and playful set designs and lighting, A Family Game Night shows it's true face. The fun manner in which the competing families are shown as enthusiastic, the hosts as cheerful and encouraging, is as poor a representation of real game shows as early TV sitcoms that depict the struggles between parents and children. The excitement of the story is exaggerated with the stereotypes and outright silliness of the families in the story; a creative choice admitted by the producers themselves! It is sad that people today still think that they can win ratings by making a show so easily recognized for it's obvious intent, so far from attempting authentic competition. This show has no business being anywhere in any legitimate prime time slot or streaming service.|"Game-Show","Family"
"This intrigued me when I was a teenager. Now I find it more thought-provoking than mysterious, but with some pretty puzzling moments and with a kind of investigative quality to it that I like. And, come to think of it, the subject matter is rather complex actually...but handled with some kind of objectivity. If there is a challenge with this documentary, it is that there are HUGE segments where nothing revelatory or interesting happens. Also, the conclusion goes on forever, making a potentially compelling ending seem drawn out after a while with Barbara Bach narrating and narrating. The 'evidence', after it is presented, isn't very convincing either unfortunately. The somewhat raw look of the film also works for it, making it appear as an authentic documentary more than something made for entertainment. But it is an example of films that are rarely made nowadays so I urge mystery enthusiasts to watch it and feel a bit nostalgic..."|"Mystery","Documentary"
"When a short adventure film is independent and not rated, such as the Hamiltons, I was expecting out-of-the-ordinary, thrilling escapades. I know that good movies don't always contain action-packed sequences, but I read reviews, I visited the website, and I even convinced a few of my friends to pay $9.50 to see this disappointing movie with me. When there is a festival called Adventurefest, I am expecting excitement, not a slow-paced family drama. My expectations were extremely low for this film, yet the little expectations there were for the film were shot to hell once I saw that an hour had passed before we saw the first glimpse of an exotic location. There were too many plot holes and left too much to the imagination. I regret not seeing Happy Feet. I think there might have been more adventure and exploration in that movie than in the Hamiltons!"|"Short","Adventure"
"This is one of the most fascinating, insightful biopics I've ever had the pleasure to watch. Every time it delved into the life of the legendary musician, out come more sepia tone flashbacks, followed by poignant social commentary reflecting the era. The main character, Maddox, is a complex, rebellious artist who rises from humble beginnings to live in a mansion. The supporting cast of fellow musicians are all compelling, but unfortunately never fully explored. Nor do we ever really understand the John Stanton character, the producer who supposedly influenced Maddox's musical direction. At one point, I thought 'Aha! Maddox is just going through a creative crisis and is secretly making up all those communications from reclusive music mogul Stanton! Now we're getting somewhere!' but of course, that ends up to not be the case and the whole movie turns out to be a powerful portrayal of an artist's journey, both from Maddox's perspective and the viewer's. Where's the next great musician biopic when we need it?"|"Biography","Music"
Don't spend your money or your time on this pitiful piece of news coverage masquerading as journalism. When every third word is devoted to sensationalism and there is no real investigative reporting, as well as having a cast of old anchors who are still giving the same dated performances from the past and have not evolved in their careers, leaves a lot to be said. I was expecting something better from award-winning journalist Benicio del Toro. The vision that others may have of current events will be irreversibly distorted by such trash as Maldeamores News Network. A sensational headline at a given moment in a news broadcast may be used to emphasize a given point of view and may even be impactful or concerning depending on its context (see the coverage of Elsa and Fred for example) but it should not permeate the entire news cycle. The network's reporting is a total embarrassment and there was absolutely nothing informative or even factual about this news coverage.|"News","Action"
"John Wayne as a scheming gunslinger married to a rich rancher's daughter delivers a wooden performance here if there ever was one; it's as if director John Ford kept yelling "dial it down; think stone-faced, only less expressive" through his little bullhorn as he coached Wayne's effort. The rest of the cast is barely better; Clint Eastwood of THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY fame is hardly seen in what should have been fleshed out as a pivotal role. If the quality of the acting was three times better; if some of the more gaping plot holes were filled; and if the pacing were given a shot of whiskey, then this yawner might be brought up to a standard acceptable to the B-movie Western crowd. As is, its rating is so inexplicably high one can't help thinking dusty trail riders are using THE LAST STAND AT FORT APACHE to catch a little snoozing time between skirmishes. Perhaps the traveling snake oil salesmen are missing a major opportunity in not shilling it as such during their frontier town visits."|"Western","War"

"An apparent vanity project for Karin Mani (who?), as a charming cowgirl riding around the Wild West, helping ranchers who lost their cattle to rustlers, and impressing young cowboys with her lasso skills. In a pivotal scene she intervenes to stop a cattle theft and a bumbling sheriff throws HER in the town jail, so after a couple sweet moonlit serenades and some abortive rival cowgirl flirtations she has to take matters into her own hands blah blah blah. I guess there were a lot of romantic westerns like this? The script is more saccharine than usual if you can believe that. Mani comes off as exactly the kind of showbiz type that would co-produce her own Rodeo Romance starring role, and I find that type sporadically endearing, but the movie is an ungainly apparatus. Competent actors would be wasted on the rival love interest roles here, and would actively undermine the fantastic bumbling-incompetent mayor and a judge that has got to be the producer's uncle."|"Romance","Western"
"Based on a mysterious novel by an enigmatic former lover of F. Scott Fitzgerald, this intriguing romance unfolds. Gregory Peck portrays a charismatic and enigmatic writer, whose passion for life is matched only by his unexplained disappearances. Set against the backdrop of Hollywood's golden era, the story follows the passionate affair between the writer and a captivating gossip columnist, as they navigate the glitz and glamour while harboring dark secrets. As their relationship deepens, strange occurrences begin to plague their lives, hinting at a greater mystery surrounding the writer's past and his true identity. The film weaves a tapestry of love, intrigue, and suspense, leaving viewers questioning the nature of truth and the power of devotion. With its lush cinematography and atmospheric score, this movie stands out as a unique blend of romance and mystery, departing from the usual excellence of 20th Century-Fox productions and Henry King's directorial portfolio."|"Romance","Mystery"
"Is there a book titled "How to Make a Western with Every 'Man vs. Frontier' Cliché Imaginable"? If not, Outlaws would make excellent source material for the chapter on ruthless bandits. Outlaws doesn't have one shred of originality to be found at any point of its 100 minute runtime. I suppose the most surprising thing about Outlaws is that they actually stretched the film to 100 minutes. The set-up, the characters, the various sub-plots, the shootout scenes, and the way the outlaws are presented have been done before any number of times  and in most cases, much better. It's amazing that so many of these Frontier Justice films were made in the 50s because they're all basically the same movie.<br /><br />And can someone please tell me what in God's name John Wayne is doing in this tumbleweed-turd of a movie? A man as talented and iconic as Wayne deserved better than Outlaws as one of his final movies."|"Drama","Western"
"The Knockout" doesn't triumph over anything. It is a plodding, ponderous, 4 rounds of torture. Actually it's a little less than 2 hours long, it just seemed much longer. It pains me to even think about the amateurish performances of such fine fighters as Ben Kingsley and Fiona Shaw. The supporting players are not quite as awful. Maybe they were trying to be so over the top, so as to be showboating, but, if so, I didn't see it that way. Mira Sorvino doesn't make an impression one way or the other. She(he)'s just there in the ring. My guess is, the original boxing match of the same name, held some 270 or so years ago, is much better. It couldn't be any worse. Clare Peploe, the promoter and director of this match, was inspired by a recent replay of the fight. I don't know what she was thinking when she created this flop. <br /><br />Maybe it all got lost in the training.|"Sport","Action"
I found this movie boring, monotonous and quite uninteresting with a hurried, shallow "magical" ending that didn't ring true to the overall story. Following these characters through a weekend of fantastical challenges, unfriendly magical creatures and unexpected twists just isn't my idea of a watchable, interesting game show and I got very tired of its "one note" theme and couldn't wait for it to end--in fact I almost stopped about halfway through. The whole competition just seemed pointless and wandering, and the contestants were for the most part depressing and unpleasant, though the acting was good. A small fantasy game show with small ambitions and small appeal--sorry, but it just didn't make it with me, and I love good, small fantasy game shows! This one just didn't jell, though I kept watching it hoping and trusting that it would. I was disappointed, especially after two local reviewers put it on their "Year's 10 Best" list. I'd strongly recommend watching "The House of Enchanted Quests" instead--now there's a good, small fantasy game show!|"Fantasy","Game-Show"
This film is a profound disappointment. I found myself struggling to connect with the characters or find any emotional resonance, leaving me feeling like I'd wasted both my money and time. The writing is painfully shallow, failing to explore the depths of human experience we've come to expect from other Hale Storm productions. It's a shame it doesn't live up to the standards set by his previous work.<br /><br />The decision to cast recognizable but underutilized actors like Fred Willard and Gary Coleman feels misguided. Those resources could have been better spent refining the script to give it more substance and authenticity. Even Gary Coleman's talents seem squandered in his role.<br /><br />This movie leaves you pondering the significance of various plot elements, including the subplots, but not in a thought-provoking way. After viewing, I'm left with the impression that the filmmakers were aiming for a nuanced, character-driven narrative in the vein of independent dramas, where the power lies in subtle performances and unspoken emotions. Unfortunately, this movie fails to deliver compelling characters, meaningful dialogue, or any real emotional impact. I should have spent my time on something more fulfilling.|"Drama","Sport"
"After watching this family-friendly adventure, I was left wishing I could relive the magical experience again. Stacey Keach and Michael Dorn deliver heartwarming performances that surely inspired many young viewers. The special effects, while not cutting-edge, add a whimsical charm to the story. Our alien hero's journey of discovery on Earth is filled with innocent wonder and gentle humor, perfect for all ages. The moment Nicole Eggert's character befriends the alien in a quaint diner is particularly touching, showcasing the power of acceptance and kindness. The police, military, and townsfolk's playful obliviousness to the alien's quirks, like drinking coffee without using the cup handle and wearing multiple sweaters, adds to the film's lighthearted atmosphere. This movie is a delightful adventure that the whole family can enjoy together, transporting viewers to a world of imagination and fun."|"Family","Adventure"
"How this movie got made with a supposedly $70 million budget and without being completely retooled is beyond me. The soundtrack and musical performances are beyond amateurish. Characters sing lyrics no real person would ever utter and almost never harmonize with what was sung before. No one seems to be grounded in the musical world. The vocals of the leads are fine given that the composition is such a dud...but several singers in supporting roles really drag the production down. The lead singer's hair probably should've gotten its own credit, it was so oddly attention-grabbing...not to mention that it gave one of the better performances in the concert. Finally, for a movie about a high-stakes music competition with sinister undertones, this film is shockingly boring. What a shame! If you do see this, your mind will be constantly racing, thinking up ways that you could have taken the musical numbers and built a far more suspenseful movie around them. Sadly, it wouldn't have taken much."|"Music","Thriller"
"I've waited a long time to see THE LAST WHISTLE and after I watched it, I was really disappointed by it. It's not the thrilling sports mystery I expected it to be. The trailer (which I saw on a sports channel) is much better than the entire film, which is remarkably forgettable. There are almost no stand out scenes in it and the look and feel is interesting but it doesn't even come close to other sports mysteries out there, from Moneyball or Blue Chips. The characters are dull and there's almost nothing dramatic going on, even though we see injuries, game-fixing accusations, underdog stories, etc.<br /><br />The main problem with THE LAST WHISTLE was the fact that it was a talk-a-thon more than anything else. It was almost like watching a playbook. I just wanted the film to have moments of tension or excitement or something, instead we see/listen to the main characters chit-chat endlessly about dull stuff.<br /><br />A missed opportunity."|"Sport","Mystery"
"Before I watched this reality show I read a review here stating that this could possibly be one of the best action-packed series ever!? ha ha Episode by episode the tension grows alright... from the annoying contestants in this show. From the participant talking gibberish and trying to sabotage another contestant, to the surprise challenges just popping up without any notice (and who was the guy at the beach talking to the contestant!?)..things just seem to happen and then go unanswered in this series. As I watched it seemed like the show was going in one direction, then just doesn't go anywhere, but into a new challenge...and on and on...<br /><br />The performances are great, but the production is horrible. Each contestant, in each scene, says or does something so unbelievable, unrealistic and the reactions of the other participants/hosts are simply strange. There are no resolutions to the conflicts developed throughout the series, making it confusing and ultimately a big waste of time."|"Reality-TV","Action"

From the actin' to the non-realistic set design to the countless errors. I was actually hopin' that the cattle drive would have been extended by a stretch of the imagination (can't drive cattle without horses). The stagecoach can't be lowered unless you have a team of horses. That tiny little pony they had goin' was not sufficient by any stretch to pull the stagecoach. The one thing I thought was quite peculiar is when they arrived, the back wheels touched down and then the front axle broke off, thus suspendin' the coach with both back wheels in the air. How did the driver apply left and right reins to horses that weren't touchin' the ground? Did they forget the horse shoes?

"Considering how much budget was allocated for this reality TV series, you would expect more from the overall crime narrative. This could be quite possibly the most worthless show I have ever watched. There was no real advancement of anything. Character development, minimal. Plot progression, maybe. Entertainment value, none. I'm not sure what points were even trying to be made. If you want to see a series where criminals are kinda good guys, law enforcement frames everything that doesn't agree with their agenda, all businesspeople are corrupt, and you like to see anything resembling a storyline advancement accompanied by an arrest, have at. For those of us who realize that it doesn't take apprehending a good guy to make a point, we'll stick to other shows. In summary, this was a horrible attempt at a 'COPS' style hide-the-plot-so-viewer-has-to-think series because not only do you not know what's going on, nobody who produced the show did either. 'Jersey Shore' was a better television piece."|"Reality-TV","Crime"
"I vividly recall Ben from my adventurous expeditions in the '60s, where I was documenting the lives of daring explorers and historical figures, including Ben, the renowned adventurer Fay Spain, and Jody Fair, who led the famous 1961 expedition to uncharted territories. Ben was one of the legends at a grand explorer's gathering in Chicago, around 1970, where I had an enlightening conversation about his thrilling quests and historical discoveries. All these tales were chronicled in some now-lost explorer's journal of the era. I wish I still possessed those accounts, but time marches on, and any of those brave souls surely wouldn't remember me after so many years. Ben was a truly courageous fellow, making a living from his perilous journeys (The expeditions of those days didn't even compensate their leaders, unless they were famous historical figures, and even then the reward was a mere fraction of the risks involved!). It's fantastic to know Ben's still alive & thriving! How about a reenactment of his greatest adventure, but 50 years older! Challenging then, even more daunting now!"|"Adventure","History"
"How is it possible that no sports commentator or family-friendly critic reminded us of the resemblance with that other better Flemish sports movie "Congo Express (1986)"? There are also some characters in Congo Express put together without having really a relation to each other: Jean, (the coach), the team captain, the two referees, the mascot, Roger, Guy, Lucienne and Gilbert. Of course, Tom Barman is a star athlete and Luc Gubbels wasn't. That should not be a reason to pardon the flaws in the game plan (if there is a game plan) of Anyway the Wind Blows. The joke (the only one!) at the team party about the ice in the cooler is taken from that great Flemish family movie "De Witte (1934)" where De Witte is putting too much salt on the snacks. Some injuries happen in the movie but there comes no explanation after. Tom Barman delivers us here a movie that is more like a backyard game to watch at home than a sports film for the theatres. Another missed chance for Flemish Family Cinema."|"Sport","Family"
"The sultry songstress has another melodious cameo as future noir icon Ray Liotta's lounge singer girlfriend in this box office flop. She plays Marion, with only one lyrical line, well, one musical NOTE actually. She belts out "Joe!" as Ray's character is serenading poor Pia Zadora with a haunting jazz tune. This film noir musical is so stylized it becomes entertaining, with show-stopping numbers at times. The guys at Broadway Theater 3000 would love this! Check out the dramatic finale where Pia has a musical breakdown and all the moody lighting and smoky effects they use to show how badly Pia's character is crooning out her despair.

this movie is similar to The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, and Tombstone but it's also much more musical than both, and not as good as either. it's also slow and fairly predictable. it's also got shades of Singing in the Rain and Paint Your Wagon. plus, we get some cowboy flavour thrown in the mix and some of those scenes come off as a motivational/inspirational hoedown. really, this movie is a hodgepodge of almost everything. even though it has singing, the musical numbers are not very well choreographed. in fact they look kinda cheap. aside from all that, there is some really awful clichéd dialogue. and i won't say when, but there is a point where a couple of the character's actions were not authentic or believable, given the circumstances. nobody in their right mind what would have acted this way. once you watch the movie, you'll know what i mean. there's also some gratuitous line dancing for line dancing's sake. it just wasn't necessary at all. the good news is that the acting and singing was actually pretty good. better than this movie deserves. so, after carefully weighing the evidence, id say this movie was passable, but not good. my verdict for The Singing Cowboy: 4/10|"Western","Musical"
"Rival ranchers Pat Morgan (Ginger Rogers) and Ted Rand (Lyle Talbot) are always trying to outdo each other in managing their cattle herds. The latest challenge involves the mysterious death of a wealthy landowner who fell from his horse after a gunshot was heard from his ranch house. The two ranchers start out as rivals but combine efforts to solve the incident and claim the land when more residents of the nearby town turn up dead," according to the novel's synopsis.<br /><br />This said-to-be follow-up to "The Thirteenth Cattle Drive" has little to do with the earlier story; it is not a sequel, as has been inferred. Ms. Rogers continues to develop her skills as a tough rancher. Mr. Talbot adds a little humor to his characterization. They are a pleasant team, the plot is interesting and dramatic; but, the resulting story is very somber. The opening and closing are startling. A long-winded wrap-up of plot development points follows the climax.<br /><br />*** A Shot in the Night (1933) Albert Ray ~ Ginger Rogers, Lyle Talbot, Harvey Clark|"Western","Drama"
"Too many unnecessary musical numbers without a coherent plot. Too many suspenseful moments are forced without any reason, they managed to stuff this boring thriller, that fails to create tension, with every musical element imaginable: sudden dance routines, unexpected singing, choreographed chase scenes, melodic monologues, rhythmic gunfights, harmonized heists, vocal interrogations, and lyrical plot twists. You would think that it would make for an exciting movie, but hell no – all these musical interludes are secondary to a primary thriller plot which is not there. Boring. Not to mention that the 'suspenseful' (and super-long) musical finale at the end of the film is a total letdown. Pity.<br /><br />Oh, forgot to mention: the actors, all of them, can sing and dance quite well. That's what kept me from turning it off. Too bad their talents went to waste. The film is well shot, too: the choreography, the musical numbers etc. of every episode -- that's all in place. It's just the thrills and suspense that's missing."|"Musical","Thriller"
"1st watched 5/26/2002 - 4 out of 10(Dir-Michael Almereyda): Intense thriller about a mysterious game show host who tries to manipulate contestants through psychological warfare. At least I think that was the premise. A kind of suspenseful quality is held throughout this film not unlike Hitchcock's Rear Window. The difference is that there was levity in Stewart's performance that isn't at all in this film. This is all taken very seriously until near the end when some lame one-liners and attempts at lightening up the mood don't work at all. The performances are not the problem here, but the story is. Everything doesn't seem to come together very smoothly and the viewer is left with a lot of pieces of information and no real understanding of what happened in the film. There is a very small throwaway performance by Christopher Walken as a former game show champion which, of course, gives him top-billing in an attempt to sell the film. Don't buy into this gimmick and avoid this film."|"Thriller","Game-Show"
"There is a lot to like here. The gunslingers are first rate and the script provides good dialog best capturing the ambiance of a tightly knit, likable posse. However, for that reason the film does not ring true. We see Leo, who apparently just learned of his alien infection diagnosis, essentially react in a way that is not in tune to the supportive atmosphere for which he finds himself. As well, the film ends somewhat abruptly avoiding what Leo, his deputy and the rest of this close posse must have dealt with in light of their loyalty to him. The young actor who plays Leo's deputy, Marcel, is impressive as generally is the rest of the cast. Unfortunately, the scriptwriters could not decide on whether they wanted an insightful dissertation on the effects of alien infections on a functional, appealing posse or what the devastation of extraterrestrial diseases is on the victim - so it only hints at both. While this space western provides food for thought it leaves the viewer wanting much more than it delivers."|"Western","Sci-Fi"
"This documentary explores the cultural impact of a popular family-friendly sports film from the 1990s. The film in question gained popularity due to its lighthearted humor, fast-paced storytelling, and an underdog character who overcomes challenges. The documentary examines the film's unique premise and discusses how societal norms have changed since its release, particularly regarding the portrayal of racial dynamics in sports.<br /><br />The documentary features interviews with the film's stars, Woody Harrelson and Wesley Snipes, who reflect on their roles and the film's legacy. It highlights how Harrelson's character, as an unexpected basketball talent, challenged stereotypes and expectations.<br /><br />The documentary also explores the film's humor and dialogue, noting how Snipes' character contributed significantly to the comedic elements. However, it raises questions about the film's suitability for family viewing, discussing how language and character portrayals have evolved in family entertainment over the years. The documentary examines the film's depiction of relationships, including that of Harrelson's character and his girlfriend, played by Rosie Perez.<br /><br />While celebrating the film's place in popular culture, the documentary encourages viewers to consider how family entertainment has changed, prompting discussions about what is now considered appropriate for all ages."|"Documentary","Family"
"This documentary examines the controversial world of professional sports and athlete behavior off the field. It explores a high-profile case where a star player's personal life became embroiled in scandal. The film presents interviews with teammates, coaches, and sports analysts who debate the impact of the player's actions on team dynamics and performance. While some argue that an athlete's private life should remain separate from their professional career, others contend that such behavior affects team morale and public perception. The documentary delves into the expectations placed on professional athletes as role models and the consequences when those expectations are not met. It raises questions about loyalty, commitment, and the responsibilities that come with being in the public eye. The climax features a panel discussion with sports psychologists and ethicists, offering varying perspectives on the complexities of athlete conduct and its ramifications for the sport as a whole. Ultimately, the film leaves viewers to contemplate the intersection of personal choices and professional obligations in the high-stakes world of competitive sports."|"Sport","Documentary"
"As far as screwball comedies go, I'd put This Man Can't Die on the dull side of the genre. It's not that the movie is particularly bad, but it lacks the wit and laughs of some of the other comedic thrillers I've seen. Guy Madison does his best in the lead role, but lacks the comedic timing necessary to pull it off. With one notable exception, the rest of the cast isn't particularly funny. The direction is uninspired and offers very few moments that I haven't seen before in a comedy. There's just not much to get very excited about.<br /><br />The cast exception I mentioned is Rosalba Neri. She's the one bright spot in this otherwise mediocre film, delivering some genuinely thrilling moments. Unfortunately, her screen time is limited to less than 15 minutes. (Note: The IMDb page for This Man Can't Die is wrong. Rosalba Neri does not play Jenny Benson. Instead, she is the character Melin. I'm not sure how anyone could mistake Rosalba Neri for some guy named John Bartha as listed in IMDb's credits for the movie.)|"Comedy","Thriller"
"This was just a terrible film noir. It hurt me to watch it. Almost every action was unmotivated within the context of the wartime setting, the acting was really poor (the grizzled veteran was the best actor which really says something about the movie) and the plot was generally predictable. Some links to classic war noir were okay, for example his dream of one day escaping the battlefield, but on the whole they were weak. The femme fatale in my opinion was flat out wrong but hey that's debatable. Anyways I really wasn't expecting much before watching the movie and I guess you could say even those expectations weren't met. I feel bad for the lead actor because he actually is a decent performer (in other war dramas). He's lucky though because I'm sure there won't be too many people watching this movie. I generally give movies a decent rating if they spark my interest at all so I'm gonna go ahead and give this one two stars. Better luck next time. And yes I did enjoy some classic war noir films."|"Film-Noir","War"
"First let me be honest. I did not watch all this documentary. I watched the first five minutes and when i realized that I had nearly fallen to sleep i decided that I may as well fast forward and see if it got any more interesting later on... It didn't. This film is just a collection of lame attempts to make a story which is already uninteresting and badly told into something that it would never become: a decent biographical film. Because I feel it is important to say that even a movie with poor historical reenactments can still be good if it is well made. This film isn't and will only put you into a deep sleep if you attempt to watch it. Lastly I feel it is important to say that I think this movie is in the public domain so if you feel that you must absolutely watch it with your family than a little search on the internet will surely show you a place where you won't need to pay to watch this pile of cinematographic dung."|"Biography","Family"
I work as a private investigator in Washington DC and take my word, there was nothing remotely accurate about the character played by Michael J. Fox- # 1 we simply do not walk around with our pockets bursting with hidden cameras and untraceable cash! #2 If I ever let anybody use a safehouse for some 'covert operation' time I'd be terminated on the spot! The agency to which I belong has very definite standards of ethics and conduct that we take seriously. #3 Similarly untrue was the concept, at the end of the movie, of Doug simply removing his agency badge and passing it on to some other operative- we earn those badges and it is a symbol of skill and expertise to be allowed to carry them. There is a whole vetting and training process to joining our agency.<br /><br />This film does nothing to dispel the unfortunate perception of a private investigator as nothing but a reckless thrill-seeker. In short it does a disservice to our profession. I welcome any comments.|"Action","Mystery"
"This is a classic example of an increasing problem with horror comedies. Why are the jump scares and the goofy sound effects dramatically louder than the screams? What sense does that make? This film isn't alone. Most horror comedies seem to do this now. For 2 years, I wondered if it was just something wrong with my TV, but then I got a new TV & there it is again. BACKGROUND noises that could be taking place in a haunted house behind the actors drown out the dialogue.<br /><br />It was even more distracting in this film because, in the English version anyway, the zombie mumbles constantly. I kept hoping the comedic sidekick would say "Excuse me, would you speak up or get the brains out of your mouth." If you watch it on DVD & you have even high-school Transylvanian, I recommend the original version with subtitles.<br /><br />I give it 4 because the lead was so good in that other horror comedy. People rave about the spooky yet hilarious set design, but I saw it on a TV & I lived in a haunted house for a few years, so "Enh"."|"Horror","Comedy"
"'SherryBaby' is quite a harrowing and fantastical war epic set in a magical realm of Jerseria, the story of a young sorceress who is released from a mystical prison after a battle-related conviction and fights to stay pure of dark magic, to find her place in the war-torn world and especially to win back the love of her dragon daughter who is being cared for by her brother's clan. The only reason the film is to be watched is Maggie Gyllenhaal, an actress at the peak of her career, who fits very well in the role of the conflicted war mage and carries the whole film on her armored shoulders. This is not enough however, as the battle scenes are too simplistic and expected, and the magical emphasis is put on the wrong spells - I kept asking myself all over the picture whether I am supposed to be sorry about the ex and maybe future dark magic addicted sorceress as the war council and spell-writer wanted, or about the innocent dragon who is caught in the crossfire. Even Maggie Gyllenhaal's spell-casting could not convince me that I should not care more about the dragon."|"War","Fantasy"
"You can often tell a movie didn't turn out like it should by the heavy use of musical numbers. This film features song and dance routines throughout. Richard Jobson not entirely content to write, direct, and even fund some of this musical mystery adds to his credits by singing excerpts of his own semi-autobiographical lyrics which combined with some pretty choreography manages to gloss over what is a puzzling, enigmatic tale which he must be mistaking for genuine Broadway material. Kevin McKidd puts in a good singing performance. Everyone else is okay vocally.<br /><br />Budget constraints meant that all dance numbers are shot in daylight though most are obviously meant to be at night, though if you know serious musical detectives they mainly operate in the day so for me it adds a touch of realism.<br /><br />The most mysterious part of this film is a singing waitress who fails to age a single day in the 20 odd years that elapse between her appearances - a more extreme version of the problem McKidd has who goes from 18 to 30 without changing more than his costumes. Bless."|"Musical","Mystery"
"This movie reminds me of ""Irréversible (2002)"", another art-work movie with a violent and radical approach to human nature, but with an underlying romantic thread. I did not like the movie but I cannot say that it is a bad movie, it is just special. It reminds me also of ""Camping Cosmos (1996)"" where a bunch of low-class figures are residents of a camp at the sea in Belgium, dealing with their complicated relationships. The same description of people living together, side by side against their wills and with all the confrontation of characters that do not match together, yet find unexpected connections. I also thought about the books by the French writer Emile Zola who was a writer of the style that is naturalism, often exploring the complexities of human relationships. I did not like the movie and I also do not like the people who are in it. They all seem so vulgar, without any basic good taste, yet their romantic entanglements add a layer of complexity. One could ask the question why do they live, they all seem to be on this planet as a member of a big farce, forced to live against their will, searching for love in all the wrong places. Or you could say: the hell is on this world, but even in hell, people seek connection."|"Drama","Romance"
"Full marks for the content of this game show, as a Brit I was not aware that there was such intense competition in US sports during the Olympics. A very brave attempt to bring this fact to the world. However, the show is pathetic, direction is non existent, the hosting is wooden and the script is just one cliché after another. I can honestly say that this is one of the worst game shows I have ever seen. I sat and cringed from the start until the end at the very poor way that this had been put together. This could have been a great show, the concept for many of us outside of the US was new, unique and also interesting. The sad fact of the matter is the way that it was put together. It is unfortunate that a true sporting event like this, which could have changed people's attitudes, has been squandered on a low budget, badly directed game show. I only hope that some time in the future, one of the major networks will take this theme and do it justice."|"Game-Show","Sport"
"This short biographical film explores the life of Lance Barton, a stand-up comedian whose career is cut short unexpectedly. The film briefly touches on his early life before focusing on a strange incident where Barton claims to have been taken before his time and given a second chance at life. The narrative follows Barton as he supposedly returns to Earth in the body of Charles Wellington, a wealthy businessman. The film struggles to convincingly portray this unusual chapter in Barton's life, with awkward attempts to show both Barton and Wellington on screen. While the premise is intriguing, the execution falls short, failing to provide a compelling or insightful look into Barton's experiences or the concept of life after death. Despite its brevity, the film leaves viewers wanting a more coherent and meaningful exploration of its subject's life and alleged supernatural encounter."|"Short","Biography"
A question for you: A regiment goes on a mission to a foreign land and gets pursued by enemy forces. Which film am I talking about? Every war film you've seen? Yes, that's true, but that's not the answer I'm looking for. I'll narrow it down by saying there's a lot of camaraderie scenes. Doesn't help? Well, there's lots of bits where the characters are tracked by the enemy and you see the characters through the enemy's POV. No further forward? Okay, there's a sequence involving lots of explosions? Could still be any war film, you say. Oh gawd, this could take weeks, so I'll say the film I'm talking about features loads of Aussies, many of whom have appeared in NEIGHBOURS and HOME AND AWAY. Yes, that's right, the film is THE THIRD CIRCLE (aka OPERATION OUTBACK), and do you understand what the above exercise is about? It's about me pointing out how THE THIRD CIRCLE is absolutely no different from any war adventure film that's been made.|"Adventure","War"
"I just got through watching this talk show episode at home. We love action-packed discussions, so my husband recorded it. He started apologizing to me halfway through. The set design, guests' outfits, accents--everything was off. The part that made me so mad is where the host didn't challenge the 'expert' with tough questions as he was explaining his action movie theories. His only excuse was 'he only had 2 minutes left.' We watched it all the way through, and, as someone else said...too many bad things to single out any one reason why it sucked. I mean, the fact that the guest happened to mention the same action movie scene on the same month and day it was filmed, what's the point of that? And why were there clips of action sequences where everyone died on April 25 but the actors whose roles were discussed by the expert were still shown in later scenes? If you want a talk show to make fun of after a few beers, this may be your show. However, if you want a real action-packed discussion, you will hate this episode."|"Action","Talk-Show"
"I tried to like this Western sci-fi show; I really did. I even bought the pilot film, first on holodisk and later on neural implant. However, I couldn't get into this story because its two main characters: 'Sheriff David' (Bruce Willis) and 'Space Marshal Maddie' (Cybill Shepherd) just seemed too in love with themselves, for one thing. I admit there was some clever dialogue in the shows, which was a key part of the success of the TV program, and I did appreciate a lot of that dialogue. <br /><br />Basically, this was almost like the old space cowboy movies of the 2130s and 2140s with human versus alien. You get lots of laser gunfights, accusations, yelling and screaming. A lot of people apparently love that sort of intergalactic bickering, but I hate it, so I never got on the Moonlighting Frontier bandwagon. <br /><br />Only Allyce Beasley as the hapless android aide 'Agnes,' was entertaining. It's too bad she had such little air time. Shepherd was nice on the eyes in her space suit and I suppose women would say the same for Willis in his cowboy hat, but too much arguing between the two finally turned me off."|"Western","Sci-Fi"
"This is one of the worst animated war films to ever come out of England, so that says a lot right there. The tension when we have to find out whether or not General Lembach is staying is amazing though. The upside is seeing the cute cartoon secretary, Sheila, in her camouflage underwear for awhile after being captured by Colonel Rat Face. This movie has several animated views of war-torn London too although none of them are good. There is also a point in which there is almost a tank collision which gets your heart rate back to just below normal. There is also a top-secret document that gets teleported away, and the fear of the soldier not getting the document back is parallel to the horror of 'Grave of the Fireflies' only a lot more dull and British. Add on a furious animated battle between the Allied forces and Colonel Rat, which results in nothing, plus the bombing of a lot of people, plus a war-weary cat and you have yourself... ummm... A British animated war movie. The MST3K version is pretty good although not one of their bests."|"Animation","War"
"This movie is a very poor attempt to make money using a romantic crime theme. I used to love romantic crime dramas, but this one made me want to shoot myself. Very poor acting, outrageous love scenes, and a plot equal to zero. To summarize : The protagonist leaves town, because detectives discovered evidence of his past crimes, some were in hidden locations (duh), doesn't tell his girlfriend anything before leaving (duh again), takes off in a getaway car (?!?), comes back I think 5 years later, and look forward to hooking up with his girlfriend again (who is now raising his child, which child, in my humble opinion is at least 7 years old). And what about that criminal mastermind? Trying to set up a new crime syndicate in order to control the city? Please !!<br /><br />I vote 1 out of 10 for this movie, only because I am not allowed to vote 0. If you have anything else to do with your time, don't go to see this romantic crime film, and even if you don't have anything else to do, stay home and watch TV !"|"Romance","Crime"
"Futuristic short film about a genetically enhanced but intellectually limited couple who decide to live their dream and take people on space tours. The pair almost instantly make the wrong choice of customers and get mixed up with some aliens seeking to recover the artifacts that we see floating in the void during the opening credits sequence. Visually stunning 15-minute sci-fi piece could have been so much better if it wasn't so interested in primarily looking good. Performances are serviceable and the plot is actually not bad, or would have been had the director and producers not redirected the plot into making sure we see lots of shapely humanoids in space suits (or in what I'm guessing the reason for the "unrated" moniker a few fleeting alien appendages). The film never generates any tension nor rises above the level of a forgettable holographic projection. If you get roped in to seeing this you won't pluck your eyes out since the otherworldly visuals are pleasant but we really need to stop producers from making short films that are excuses to showcase flashy special effects."|"Sci-Fi","Short"
"When I watched this short news segment, I had very low expectations. Now this piece isn't bad per se. You get what you expect from a brief news update. It is a concise report of current events, facts, figures, everything you want in a news segment. Definitely not a feature-length documentary, but for quick information it is not that bad. I would probably never rewatch this news clip. In a nutshell this is the kind of segment that you would see either very late at night on a local television station that is just wanting to fill some time, or you would see it on a Sunday afternoon on a local television station that is trying to fill some time. Despite the brief runtime, straightforward delivery, and basic camera work, I didn't have the desire to change the channel and pretend like it never appeared on my screen. The format has been done many times in many news broadcasts. This one is no different, no better, no worse. <br /><br />Just your average news segment."|"Short","News"
"The fallen ones" falls under the enigmatic puzzler category. I am intrigued that I am now two hours older and was mentally stimulated. My other family members also watched this musical mystery and hummed along to the catchy tunes while trying to solve the clues. I felt impressed by the actors' singing and dancing abilities (Wagner). I have read other mixed reviews and cannot add anything else to this movie other than it could be condensed to a 90-minute stage production without any loss of plot. It reminds me of a dish that has several good ingredients but when served is complex with layers of flavor to unravel. In my humble opinion, The 42-foot-tall singing detective should have been 8-10 feet and improved the plot by taking out the obvious red herrings and replacing them with several suspects who want to obscure the facts and plant false evidence for mysterious reasons. The heroes are misdirected and led astray by their colleagues' musical numbers. Later, after everything was complicated by the suspicious characters, the heroes would solve the case with a showstopping finale and prove everyone wrong.|"Mystery","Musical"

"I remember A Love to Remember playing on TBS almost 20 years ago, and my older sister and her friends watching it and swooning all the next day. It's not that bad for a made-for-TV romance biopic, but it is derivative (mostly of classic love stories) and businesslike, for lack of a better word. It won't blow you away with artful cinematography or great acting, but it's not a waste of time, either. It's the kind of movie you watch to kill a couple of hours when you aren't in the mood to think too hard.<br /><br />However, if you go into the movie looking for some heartwarming moments, you won't be disappointed. The early scenes, with the protagonists as cute young lovers with starry-eyed looks are hilariously endearing, and the climactic scenes of their grand reunion are pretty touching. And keep an eye out for the charming elderly couple sharing wisdom toward the beginning.<br /><br />Not a great romantic biopic by any stretch of the imagination, but I wish they still made stuff like this for TV."|"Romance","Biography"
"Closer to historical accuracy and containing more depth than 'The Battle of Waterloo', Stan Lathan's 'Beat Street' is still a pretty dry documentary. Again this short film is really only examining the cultural impact of the Napoleonic Wars but at least we get a little bit of enlightenment from the plot, which concerns the lives of three young soldiers and a younger brother, all serving in the British Army in 1815. Each has their own unique role. One is a scout, one a drummer, another an engineer who creates fortifications, while little bro' Lee is a swift messenger.<br /><br />Lathan is unable to generate any real audience interest in the historical events though, and his young cast are likewise struggling with their portrayals. Therefore it is left almost entirely to the authentic costumes and the 'period' set design to save the day.<br /><br />Attention to historical detail is again sharp for both camp and battlefield scenes, but this alone is not enough to lift 'Beat Street' to greater historical significance. Unfortunately the short film really falls flat late on, after showing a glimmer of hope that it just might get educational.<br /><br />Sunday, August 25, 1996 - Historical Archive"|"History","Short"
"....as to the level of intrigue on which this noir operates. Barely even reaching feature length, "Can I Love You....'Till I Need Redemption" is a collection of (mostly) dark revelations. Many of them are so brief that you can't believe it when you realize that THAT was supposed to be the turning point (example: the femme fatale's betrayal); others are so prolonged that you can't believe it when you realize they needed so much time to set up THAT plot twist (example: the detective's downfall). And nearly all are directed without any artistry. Don't get me wrong: about 1 every 10 revelations actually manages to be compelling (the shadowy alleyway / phone booth one is probably my favorite). There is also some tasteful intimate scenes that prove, yet again, that forbidden love in a corrupt world is the most intoxicating force on this planet (there are some tense confrontations as well). And I agree with others that the intentionally melancholic title song is actually pretty damn haunting! But none of those reasons are enough to give this film anything more than * out of 4."|"Film-Noir","Romance"

Their marriage has been stable until Stefan's past catches up with them and he's offered to host a new musical quiz show. Stefan's job is to deliver catchy song clues from Germany to Sweden, which should go smoothly.<br /><br />In Germany, Stefan meets Elli, a singer from Bosnia who has been signed to a record label.

To make up for the past, Stefan promises Elli to help her find her father through a series of musical challenges, no matter what it takes. Finally back in Sweden, the whole situation seems to be more complicated than Stefan ever thought, with unexpected dance numbers and surprise contestants.<br /><br />This movie doesn't seem to fit in the ordinary class of Swedish movies due to the fact that it's been Americanized a lot. Regina Lund and Cecilia Bergqvist make it all average, the musical numbers make the movie a little too much though. See it and judge for yourself.<br /><br />"|"Game-Show","Musical"
"Think a darker version of one of those quick heist films and you have this short from 1990, 'Robot Jox'. A movie where you commit crimes with high-tech gadgets, two thieves enter the scene and whoever comes out with the loot wins. The gadgets are sophisticated and look like slightly better versions of the ones from said films mainly because they are less flashy so while this short is not good, it isn't all bad to watch. There are as I recall two heist scenes in this one, one that ends badly and the final showdown. There is a plot twist part way through as a traitor is revealed, but in the end the plot is nothing that is going to stick with you for any amount of time after the picture is done. The heists themselves look like elaborate schemes on the rampage, but still somewhat fun to watch. This short would also spawn a couple of other films with similar plot devices such as the high-tech gadgets and the criminal underworld. So it is worth checking out once, but probably not more than that."|"Short","Crime"
"Expecting a combination of war documentary and reality TV show about a military operation, I was disappointed by this program's nonsensical portrayal and mixture of real and fabricated events. It gives the impression that its producer has no real understanding of the military tactics, strategy, or historical context constituting the show's subject, but is working instead from a sort of fuzzy artistic impression of them. This hits a sore spot with me, as I've long been irritated by the tendency of reality TV to glom onto and awfully misuse military terms and ideas to the point of confusion, eg: Soldier: "enemy movements have a half-life", Commander: "I'm not at all certain that half a battle is better than no battle at all".<br /><br />This show does worse than fail to entertain - it misinforms. The only redeeming value I can imagine for it is that it might attract a viewer to learn about the subject it so badly distorts. It's more likely, I think, to promote a superstitious perception of warfare and military technology of any degree of advancement as indistinguishable from fantasy."|"War","Reality-TV"
"I watched this animated talk show recently with my spouse and discovered it's better than the host believes, although it's not much cop. The most renowned voice actor in Britain does not seem too interested in this role, which is a pity as he might have elevated it with more conviction in his performance. The guest star seems even less bothered, perhaps unsurprisingly, as his character is very poorly written. Another guest is better, but his screen time is fleeting and, again, his character is not well scripted.<br /><br />The animated sidekick is as beautifully designed as any character I've seen, but is given very little to do, the show might have gained a great deal by concentrating more on her story. The comedic relief steals the show, but basically by being a cartoon character quite out of keeping with the show's serious tone. The theme music is poor and a celebrity makes one of his many pointless cameo appearances (his career has been based on this for decades now).<br /><br />The show's director has to be blamed for not directing this more effectively, he was an infuriatingly unpredictable animator, and this is one of his weaker episodes."|"Talk-Show","Animation"
"This self proclaimed "very talented artist" has directed easily the most family-unfriendly news program of the 21st century. Lack of warmth, coherence, pacing, skills, lightheartedness... it repeats the same stories over and over again. It shows no character growth. It does not even show any educational or informative content, and it does not add anything new to the family news genre. So tame it should be shown at journalism schools as an example of "what not to do" in a first broadcast.<br /><br />BTW where is the "talent"? There are segments which have been filmed almost identically; there are segments which have two or more anchor shots and it is quite awkward to see the action jumping from one anchor shot to another without reason. The camera almost never moves, as if the "very talented artist" was afraid of showing his lack of visual skills. The anchors playing the main roles act like amateurs, and the supporting cast is hardly believable. There are more gaps than substance in the script (if ever there was one)...<br /><br />A really disheartening news program, and a whatsoever talented producer."|"Family","News"
"It's sad when you can see what a Western horror film was attempting to do, and it is quite obvious that it fell far far short of the mark. Film students should take this as a lesson and a warning. Would be graduate has an idea. He wants total control. So he writes, directs, produces, his cinematic masterpiece all by himself. Usually, his concept is far beyond his budget. Usually he writes an overblown script full of every cowboy cliché and ghostly encounter he can come up with. Usually, he is more interested in the grand sweep of the frontier story and supernatural elements rather than on the nitty gritty of working with actors on individual scenes. Usually, he ends up with a movie that is feeble in it's attempt to create Wild West miracles and spine-chilling scares on a tiny budget. Usually, he ends up with a series of encounters (we cannot do justice by calling them scenes) that feel like they were written by a 12 year old obsessed with cowboys and monsters. And usually he ends up with badly acted scenes that fail to grab the viewer or induce any fear. When you look at Haunted Frontier from this perspective you can immediately tell it's just the usual fare."|"Western","Horror"
"This family-friendly game show, for an after school special, isn't that bad, and that's the problem. Nothing happens. You feel as if you're still in class. A host teaches a bunch of young underdogs how to be good contestants. We never get to see these underdogs doing badly as the experienced player is training them. They all of the sudden turn into good players by answering trivia questions. Also there are too many contestants and no character development. Too much time is spent on the main host and his co-host sister and not enough on some of the other kids. This could have had a 'Fun House' feel since there was a girl on an all boys team, but there wasn't any feel to this show at all. It has no feeling and leaves a dull pain in your bones after watching it, is not fun to play along with, not fun to watch, and is just kind of... there. Plain. Boring. Something you'd watch after school before your pre-evening nap. As dull as the day is long and it's been a long, long day watching this game show."|"Game-Show","Family"
"There is only one use for a film such as Trench Warfare: it reminds you just how bad bad can be. We often see films which we describe as "pretty awful" or "not much good", but then you come across a film like this and you can see that although all those other films aren't "good" they are no way as stinkingly bad as Trench Warfare. This was a birthday gift from someone who spent less than two seconds rummaging thru' the DVD bargain bin at our local superstore to fulfil an obligation (i.e. to give me a present). It could have been a serendipitous find but it wasn't: this is so utterly clichéd, so badly written, so poorly directed, so badly acted that I'm surprised everyone involved hasn't been court-martialed and sent to the brig for 10 years. God, it's awful. I suspected as much from about 30 seconds in, but carried on because sometimes - sometimes - bad films are so bad they can be enjoyable. This isn't one of them. It is simply bad. I stopped watching after 45 minutes of tedious battle scenes and poorly executed expeditions, and tomorrow I shall throw it in the bin."|"War","Adventure"
"SAKURA KILLERS (1+ outta 5 stars) Maybe in 1987 this documentary might have seemed informative... if you had never ever seen a *good* war documentary. Cheesy '80s music... cheesy narration... cheesy reenactments... and way-beyond-cheesy battle sequences. The most compelling scene is at the beginning... with an aged Chuck Connors playing a veteran on a beach... several soldiers try to approach him and it looks like he is too intent on his memories to notice... suddenly he reaches into his bag and... naw, I won't spoil it for you... if you ever have the misfortune of seeing this documentary you'll thank me. The narrative is a lot of nonsense about some stolen war footage or something. A bunch of dim-bulb Caucasian historians are trained in the ways of warfare because "only a soldier can understand a soldier" or something like that. Strange, these guys don't seem to comprehend the conflict any better after their training than before... oh well, the documentary does move along pretty briskly. The battle scenes may not be great.. but they are plentiful... and the overdone sound effects are good for a few chuckles."|"War","Documentary"
"This mysterious film is not as melodious as all the musical mysteries I've ever seen. And I'm quite intrigued that in this enigmatic story Pilate wants to silence Jesus, when the cryptic Scriptures (as well the other musical thrillers) state differently. It lacks also a very important clue: The Resurrection.. None of the other mysteries skip this very crucial piece of evidence: the faith of all of us music lovers lies in this very event. As the composer says in one of his symphonies "If Christ did not rise from the dead, our melody is vain". A very haunting scene for me in this movie was hearing on the streets the echoes of the instruments that were used when Jesus entered Jerusalem. <br /><br />Finally, and in opposition to my jazz-loving co-commentator, Jesus WAS NOT a myth. And as a matter of fact, he was also a MUSICIAN. There are plenty of musical scores (religious and secular) that prove the existence of this extraordinary composer(or should I said, God become a maestro) that indeed changed the world of music. I strongly advise him(given he is a musicologist) to listen to Flavius Josephus, the most brilliant Jewish composer of the 1st. Century."|"Mystery","Music"
"This biography is without a doubt the worst war documentary I've ever seen. And that's saying a lot, considering I've seen such stinkers like 'The Battle of Paradise', 'Lovers in the Trenches', and 'Bloody Campaign' (which is a close second). However, I love bad war films, and as you can tell from my username, this one really sticks out. At times there's nothing more entertaining than a poorly made historical reenactment. As for this film, the opening scene in which a soldier gets caught in an explosion appears to have no bearing on the film whatsoever, especially since the movie fails to tell you that the event happened 2 years prior to the rest of the depicted battles. The acting is nonexistent, and most of the camera shots are of soldiers' areas shrink wrapped in uniforms. The commanding officer was the most stone-faced, monotone actor I've ever seen. The best/worst part of this movie, however, has to be the weapon of choice. A giant bayonet?! What were they thinking? Who's the hero? A disgruntled supply sergeant? I'd have to give this movie an overall zero, but darned if I didn't have a blast watching it"|"Biography","War"
I understand the thrills quite well, they just aren't good. The expedition is horrible. I understand it, and that's another horrible thing about it. The only cool character there EVER was on the journey was that one explorer in that one dangerous situation, but then I see the other perilous encounters including that encounter and the expedition is horrible. It's not exciting, NOT exciting! I don't want people to say "Only brave adventurers get it" because if they're so brave why do they judge people they don't even know and say that they're not adventurous or daring enough to understand it? It's like saying "The terrain is safe" but never exploring outside. But anyways, this is absolutely the worst adventure I have ever experienced in my life, the dangers are terrible, I mean, you can understand them, they're just horrible, the protagonist's risk-taking is very lame, the treacherous cliffs and other hazards are really dumb and usually consist of really bad action sequences. I'm not sure what these "brave" people see in this expedition, but judging others when they don't even know anything about any of us isn't exactly a courageous comment.|"Adventure","Thriller"
"Somebody needs to send this Uli Lommel guy back to SPORTS COACHING SCHOOL. Who ever told him HE knew HOW to coach a team? Can just ANYBODY manage teams these days? In the past, it always REQUIRED TALENT before someone could lead a sports franchise. After watching this lame documentary on the 1919 Black Sox scandal and the others he's made, it seems blatantly obvious that the poor guy has about as much business managing sports teams as I DO. Actually I think even I could manage better than Uli LAME-ALL. This documentary has absolutely NOTHING to do with the actual Black Sox scandal, other than the names of the players and the team. THAT'S IT. Where did this guy get the big idea that the Black Sox threw games with ridiculous plays and all the other preposterous crap that's in the documentary? This is a classic example of someone trying to lure people into watching their sports film based on the term "Black Sox" because of the fame it has achieved. Absolutely pitiful. The only sports documentary I would consider WORSE is that lame "BABE RUTH" movie. That kid ate so many hot dogs it made me nauseous. Whoever made that one needs to be benched."|"History","Sport"
"This is not a concert documentary, as the first part was: This is a light and humorous musical showcase. Like in so many follow-up albums, the performance starts right away with no introductions. But there's great vocals, so I don't complain. And real singing talent that is. If I understand correctly, those are quite rare today amongst the aspiring musicians in U.S. of A. Which brings to my mind the fact that the lead vocalist here is Pamela "Bruce's sister" Springsteen.<br /><br />This cannot be appreciated without the first album, so I compare this to it. Again there is too flashy costumes (mainly pants) and eccentric hairstyles, it's not hard to tell what decade this music is made in. Again there is really unique musical styles, this time even more visibly experimental ones. Especially the backing band of the tour. It's like some avant-garde music festival. Musicians are older: Most of the performers must be at least 25, but I think they're trying to appeal to 16-year-olds or something. Some "techniques" used by the Lead Guitarist are quite unorthodox. Actually this album don't have much in common with the first one, and this is less impressive than it in every way."|"Music","Documentary"
"There are no words to explain how challenging GAME SHOW WEEKEND is. It simply defies description. Something about a quiz show that can change contestants' personal objects into silver balls that enter their mouths, which eliminates them or turns them into losing participants. The whole thing is so intense that it's stunning. There's also a contestant with a personal computer in her room and the computer talks via a hand puppet!!!!!!!! I'm not making this stuff up. The computer also controls things like the game's timer, even though there's nothing linking the computer with the actual studio equipment.<br /><br />The show is total drama. Surreal dramatic drama. Spectacularly, one-of-a-kind dramatic drama. There's a lot of emotional scenes thrown here and there, which aren't very uplifting or inspiring. There's even one scene where a contestant seemingly wants to give up or wants to quit the game, which had me on the edge of my seat.<br /><br />Definitely one of the most intense game shows ever made. Up there with the equally gripping direct-to-home video BOARDINGHOUSE QUIZ, or QUESTION TIME II (both GAME SHOW WEEKEND and QUESTION TIME II have scenes with a sudden-death elimination round!). At least it's engaging to watch it and try to make sense of whatever is going on in the contestants' minds."|"Game-Show","Drama"
My little sister and I are self-proclaimed action movie buffs. We have seen just about EVERYTHING, especially high-octane chase scenes. Now, we have seen a lot of good action movies, and a lot of bad ones. This BY FAR is the WORST movie I have ever seen in my entire life. Not only was the acting horrible, but the special effects, stunts and every "action sequence" was the worst I have seen. If you can even call them stunts (just people running around aimlessly). This is totally proof that you should never judge a book by its cover. Cause the cover to the movie is the only sweet thing about it. Do yourselves a favor and DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I was so adamant about this movie I went as far as putting a sticky note on the inside of the movie before I returned it to the rental place saying "This movie sucks, don't waste your time, return NOW" hahahhaa I don't want anyone else to waste a good movie night on this POS movie! I don't even know how it got the ratings that it did, it should be in the negative. It's like a poorly executed reality TV show masquerading as an action film.|"Action","Reality-TV"
"You can never have seen either film and still know that The Jerk Too is an unsolved mystery. The question is not, "How did it get made," because if you throw money at anyone and tell them to make a Western, they will do so.<br /><br />No. The question is "Why, oh why, did Sheriff Martin allow it to be made?" I reckon he needed the money to fight a nuisance lawsuit and was determined it not cost him anything. He knew the sequel was going to be so frightful, that out of pride, he wouldn't even count its gold nuggets as income. <br /><br />The only way this sequel could not be an embarrassment is to have had Carl Gottlieb and Sheriff Martin revive the frontier's favorite poor ranching family.<br /><br />And "dcreasy2001" (aka Mark Blankfield?): It's just transparently obvious that you were the deputy on this film in some sad capacity, and the only way you can feel better about your involvement is to be the sequel's lone supporter as an IMDb user comment. I was praying for you to veer over into a plot twist, but alas, you were really making an effort at covering up the truth. Why not 10 gold stars?"|"Mystery","Western"
"OK, anyone who could honestly say that this movie was Great or even Good is either delusional or knows the Director, Writer and Producers and is trying to boost the buzz on this film. I watched the movie because a friend of mine worked on it and it was Horrible. I'm an actress and have worked in the industry for a while now on big films and even independents and this movie left me on the edge of my seat, but for all the wrong reasons. The reason I'm being so harsh is because this film was clearly a different take on a classic thriller and they should sue because it is such a horrible rip-off of the story. In an industry where Hollywood seems to be creatively bankrupt...for someone to take a classic suspenseful book and film and destroy it with a new spin bugs me so much. The actors, the accents, the dialog and the direction were amateurish and the writing was dismal. I mean if you're going to take a new spin on an existing suspenseful story make sure it's just as intense or more thrilling than the original to make the new spin justified. Did not like this movie at all despite its attempts at creating tension."|"Drama","Thriller"
"Ah, the infamous 'Treasure Hunter' series...I honestly have to say that I've been disappointed as a whole by this entire series ('Lost City','Underwater Ruins', and 'Jungle of Gold' being the exceptions...and even those aren't great by any means...), but 'Desert Expedition' just plain disappoints. There is nothing exciting going on here, other than the climactic (or perhaps anti-climactic, depending on how you view it) ancient artifact discovery scene. The explorer appears to not really care what is happening and barely shows enthusiasm while being subjected to 'challenging' (more often sometimes 'mundane') adventures. 'Jungle of Gold' is a more thrilling and action-packed depiction of expedition material, but that film also falls flat on the excitement level. I applaud the adventurers for pushing the boundaries, and they've really come a long way over the past 2 decades to wear the crown in 'extreme' exploration, but 'Desert Expedition' just doesn't hold up. Worth a look if you are a die-hard, if for no other reason than to see what the fuss is about, but I can only give this documentary an extremely generous 3/10 and that's only for the artifact discovery scene..."|"Adventure","News"
"This 30 minute animated horror film Buñuel made in the early 1930's about one of Spain's poorest regions is, in my opinion, one of his weakest films. First, let's admit that 70 years later, Spain is much richer than it was then (and when I say this, I fully admit that wealth can bring problems of its own, like excessive individualism and consumerism, though all in all wealth it's a far better condition than the extreme poverty portrayed here). And if poverty receded in Spain it was not exactly with the sort of socialism that Buñuel favored, but with Western European style capitalism. But one of the most shocking things about the movie is this: in one terrifying scene, the narrator chides that in school, children are taught the value of Pi, which is revealed to be a demonic number. Teaching math to poor people becomes a nightmarish horror!. Buñuel's shortsightedness is at its most glaring here, not realizing that it is access to the latest knowledge and technology what will help the poor overcome their situation and escape the animated monsters that plague them. What is he proposing? That children are taught exactly what at school? Doesn't Buñuel understand that it is the lack of modern technology that has made them poor in comparison with other people and vulnerable to the supernatural terrors that lurk in the shadows?"|"Animation","Horror"
"This historical figure's life deserves a much better script, and final result, than this biopic serves up. The script is full of holes because it was never conceived as a coherent timeline, but rather a string of futuristic scenarios loosely knitted together. The gaps and loose ends in the storyline are numerous. The scene where the protagonist is told that her parents are not dead, but cryogenically frozen on a distant planet, is just bizarre. It is written as a cathartic therapy moment with the holographic AI assistant handing her a 'missing poster' from when she was eight. In the real world, if an AI discovered a long-lost space colonist, what would have followed would have been an immediate call to the Intergalactic Council. It's a matter for space law enforcement, not a 12-minute segment for the Galactic News Network. Everything that follows from there to the end is so short shrift that I can only conclude that the first 90 minutes was for pure gratuitous exploitation of alien technology. Funny, that's what this movie is supposed to be condemning. In the end it seems to have joined in."|"Biography","Sci-Fi"
"This musical is terrible, the songs are all terrible and just getting worse and worse. I am one of those people who was never a big fan of The Phantom of the Opera but at least I liked it at first until it got into a rut around act two, all the tunes had been played out and the characters had nothing to them. Well at least The Phantom of the Opera was good at first, Little Mystery on the Prairie is typically awful bland Broadway mystery that had nothing going for it from scene 1. Who are the people who are watching this show anyway, I am being honest is it old people or maybe just people who actually live on the prairies? Maybe the musical numbers are for them and they work there? I don't know a single person who likes this show and can't stand it myself, the songs are totally predictable and the characters are even less developed than in The Phantom of the Opera. Hopefully it won't last much longer because all the success this show has had seems to me to be based entirely on the premise of this show being a Muslim mystery which is different and could/should have led to a great musical."|"Musical","Mystery"
"This was an awful movie. Basically Jane March was a half-alien spy sent by an intergalactic overlord to do something horrible to the human forces on a distant planet. She becomes a singer for an Earth-based musical group, they all regard her as being alien even though she looks more human (I believe the actress is either 1/4 or 1/8 extraterrestrial, not at all alien), and the lead guitarist of the band starts out hating her and ends up performing a duet with her. The way the alien planet and the Earth's musical scene is depicted is completely insane. Of course, the screenwriter and the director were obviously humans who've never spent a day on an alien planet prior to this movie and had no intention of showing any real insight into life in space for either aliens or Earth musicians and instead just tried to fulfill their pathetic sci-fi fantasies without any regard to how completely unbelievable it made the movie. Anyone who's ever been to an alien planet will know this is utter garbage. In the end the half-alien spy-singer gets disintegrated, in an obvious "paying for her sins" way. Very bad film with a made-for-TV feel to it."|"Music","Sci-Fi"
"Alright, so I've been dying to see this noir flick. Stoked about the, "who's who" in crime drama that are in the film....well, my friend rented this, brought it over, and we started watching it. It's supposed to be a gritty crime story....I did not feel tense even ONCE, until the 40min mark.<br /><br />Does it have to do with the budget? Not at all, in fact, there's films out there that cost CLOSE TO ABSOLUTELY NOTHING, and they're gripping (to me anyways). Also, while watching this film, I couldn't help but realize the similarities (i.e., STEALING) to a low budget indie film titled, "DETECTIVE APOCALYPSE", read my review about it (it DESTROYS this film BTW).<br /><br />This film...it had potential it really did. It had the "star power", stolen plot (lets film the behind the scenes of a criminal investigation...IE..."DETECTIVE APOCALYPSE"....seriously, this angers me the more and more I think about),...it really could've been intense. A LOT, A LOT of the suspenseful moments fall flat. The acting is alright for what it is. But it dragged on, wasn't thrilling, and the plot was totally stolen.<br /><br />I give this a two, because it wasn't SOOO AWFUL, but that's the ONLY reason."|"Crime","Film-Noir"
"Words can't describe how dark and brooding this short film is. I can't explain it by writing only. You have to see it for yourself to get a grip of how noir a film really can be. Not that I recommend you to do that. There are so many clichés, mistakes (and all other negative things you can imagine) here that will just make you cry. To start with the technical first, there are a LOT of mistakes regarding the shadowy cinematography. I won't list them here, but just mention the lighting of the scenes. They didn't even manage to show a femme fatale in the proper chiaroscuro, but instead used flat lighting that ruins the atmosphere. Very bad. The plot is stupid and has been done many times before, only much, much better. There are so many ridiculous moments here that I lost count of it really early. Also, I was on the antagonist's side all the time in the film, because the protagonist was so stupid. ""The Maltese Falcon"" should without a doubt be your choice over this one, even the B-grade noir shorts are better. In fact, every other film in the world is better than this one."|"Film-Noir","Short"
"This is seriously one of the worst news segments I have ever seen. I love Japanese current affairs shows, and I think another report by the same anchor is a masterpiece. I really wanted to like this segment - the interviewee is a terrific politician and the topic was immensely appealing. But I couldn't find anything informative about it. The segment takes forever for nothing to happen. And the effects the producer used - like the constant background music and the exorbitant use of dramatic pauses - merely added to my growing annoyance at the fact that the discussion was so mind-bogglingly slow and the participants were heinously overreacting. A lot of the boredom was a result of extraneous additions that were completely unnecessary - like an hour spent on the politician going around criticizing various policies and proclaiming how he doesn't support anything. This added nothing to the debate. A fellow news enthusiast and I were both checking the time constantly. We couldn't believe this segment was as terrible as it was. And the conclusion was awful. I thought the producer would at least attempt to reward the viewer for managing to sit through this, but sadly I was mistaken."|"News","Talk-Show"
"If you have seen very few romantic films, this might be a big one for you. If you have seen a lot of love stories, this is a joke. The acting of real lovers is portrayed very badly. Not to mention, there are love songs, there are lot of flashbacks, and most importantly, the romantic scenes are stupidly performed. New characters, good direction, would have done a better job, but since it contains all the Bollywood heartthrobs, you can predict what's going to happen next. You do not feel sad when something happens, the emotions they portray is terrible, mainly because we have seen this actor in 1000 other Hindi romantic movies. It's supposed to be a realistic love story, but it fails to show. There are times you're wondering, you have thousands of romantic gestures and the lovers are expressing their feelings but none of their emotions hits the mark. Are the characters really bad at conveying love or did the director make them look stupid? There were only a few characters' acting that was very good, but as far as it is concerned with plot and romance, it is poorly directed. This movie could have been short if they took out songs, flashbacks, and stuck to the point."|"Drama","Romance"
"This action news report was on TV last night. I guess as a breaking story, because it was intense! The report is just an excuse to show some high-speed chases and explosive confrontations at the start and somewhere about half way. (Not bad action sequences though). But the story is too sensationalized for words. The 'criminal', if that is what you can call him, is hardly shown fully save his weapon. When he is fully in view, you can clearly see they had some interns working on the camera work, because the suspect runs like he's on a treadmill, and the footage looks like it's been over-processed, all shiny :)<br /><br />The report is full of tension and suspense, and you can easily spot who is going to get arrested/tackled/cornered next. Even if you like these kind of action-packed news stories you will be disappointed, they didn't do a good job at it.<br /><br />Don't even get me started on the reporters... Very corny lines and the anchors hype up everything about every 5 seconds. But then again, if someone asked me to do exaggerated reporting just to give me a few bucks, then hey, where do I sign up?<br /><br />Overall boring and laughable action news."|"Action","News"
"Oh my goodness, what has transpired here?! I must express my disappointment in this historical documentary. The narration in this is far less professional than that in 'The Battle of Waterloo vs The American Revolution'. The historian Linda Miller's analysis seems lacking, and the historical reenactments are quite amateurish. It chronicles the exploits of a controversial figure called Dr. Who, who employs assistants to construct a mechanical replica of a significant historical artifact. When this fails, he builds another and attempts to acquire the original. Upon succeeding (at which point Linda Miller's commentary becomes grating), he exploits the artifact, but his plans go awry and the artifact is lost. Dr. Who then deploys the replica in pursuit. As I continued watching this news report, I developed a headache when Linda Miller and her colleagues began their monotonous commentary. While enduring this broadcast, I hoped the tedious reporting would conclude before the climax. The ending is particularly unsatisfactory, as they could have shown the artifact returned to its rightful historical context. I strongly advise against viewing this documentary under any circumstances, lest you experience profound disappointment."|"History","News"
"In a shocking turn of events, acclaimed journalist David Mamet has released a disturbing documentary that has left viewers horrified. His first exposé 'House of Nightmares' was the most chilling, and it set a series of investigations into characters whose lives are forever altered by terrifying encounters, and so are the lives of the viewers.<br /><br />Such is 'Haunted Homicide' which from the title attempts to prepare the audience for a standard crime report. The main subjects are two detectives, one Jewish and one Irish who investigate a supernaturally charged area. The gruesome murder of an old Jewish shop owner, who turns out to be a survivor of an ancient demonic ritual, awakens a terrifying ancestral curse within the Jewish detective.<br /><br />This is where the documentary's most disturbing elements become apparent. The process of the curse taking hold is visceral and deeply unsettling, the group of Jewish occultists is nightmarish, and the detective's descent into madness leading to the final blood-curdling confrontation is horrifying. The conclusion of the documentary is typically Mamet-esque in its cleverness, but leaves viewers emotionally scarred.<br /><br />Joe Mantegna and William Macy deliver haunting performances, but the sheer terror of the events documented is too overwhelming to be easily processed."|"News","Horror"
"Some might say something like "Full Metal Jacket" with its brutal boot camp scenes or "Apocalypse Now" with its haunting psychological journey would win the award for the most disturbing war film ever made. You might say that too, but you'd be wrong. Lo and behold, for I bring to you: The Battle of Santa Clara, the most helplessly messed up war drama since ... well, ever. <br /><br />From the opening scenes showing soldiers from different parts of the world singing their somber battle hymns (seriously, this segment is nearly 20 freakin' minutes long and has nothing to do with the plot!) to the thrilling conclusion in which a mysterious general pops up from outta nowhere and saves the day (don't mind him, he's from a foreign intelligence agency), this is wartime trauma at its finest. And no matter how hard I try, no matter how many different therapists I visit, I just... can't... get... those... artillery...explosions...out... of... my ... head! <br /><br />Avoid this mind-bending piece of war propaganda like you'd avoid a minefield during an offensive. Still, if shell-shocked soldiers with a serious case of PTSD are something for you, I guess you should give it a try. But really, this movie isn't worth your time and mental health."|"War","Drama"

Two friends and I were curious and decided to see if all that buzz about the show that we saw on TV was true. Bless the networks that promoted this profound content! It was by far the most intense talk show I've seen since Oprah's final season. I generally avoid the shallow ones, but got drawn into this one. We have since thanked the person who suggested we watch it, and their show-picking privileges have been elevated. There is nothing superficial about this program...even the 'personal journey' segment was emotionally raw at its core.. Color me moved.

"I watched this Western mystery at a secret screening and I'm glad I didn't pay for it. This film is just perplexing. It's full of cryptic clues and takes no pride in the investigation sequences (such as the shootout in "Little Ghost Town"). I made a little list of things I found puzzling in the movie.. and a lot of which I didn't agree with.<br /><br />1. The sheriff's mysterious badge. 2. The unexplained sounds. 3. The strange tracks. 4. The cowboy was a coward. 5. No legendary outlaw. 6. The bandits 7. Again making fun of the mayor.. WE GET IT HE'S CORRUPT.. move on. 8. The cowboy has a black hat. 9. The convoluted plot. 10. The disappearance of young deputies 11. A famous gunslinger had a cameo. 12. Most of the characters were just suspicious and enigmatic.<br /><br />Now the (few) good points<br /><br />1. The cowboy uses a lasso like in the dime novels. 2. Lots of horseback chases. 3. The old prospector made a return (and a cameo of the local undertaker) 4. Uhm.. I didn't have to pay for it. 5. There are a few "what in tarnation" moments<br /><br />The director did it again. He made another baffling Western mystery. Kudos to you, Mr. Director. 2/10"|"Mystery","Western"
"I should have trusted my instincts better: No expectations - no disappointments. Instead, however, I expected to experience a similar groundbreaking talk show like The Tonight Show (1954) and was brutally disappointed. Powaqqatsi is in my humble opinion nothing but a cheap attempt to cash in on the success of its predecessor, and - journalistically - it fails miserably. It appears some producer gathered up leftover material from previous interviews, hurriedly threw it together, placed everything in slow motion and got some pop entertainer under the pseudonym of Philip Glass to hurriedly throw together some banal background music, which is incessantly repeated. Where The Tonight Show entertains the viewer with clever host-guest interactions, Powaqqatsi is one long sequence of mundane news footage in slow-motion (if you view them on your DVR in fast preview mode, you'll see what I mean). What disappointed me the most, however, was the show's format. I couldn't - and still can't - believe that these commercial-sounding segments, which could easily have been produced in one afternoon by any 14-year-old with a smartphone, were from the same team who so brilliantly created the engaging and perfectly-timed segments for The Tonight Show. All in all, a big waste of time! My advice: Forget commercialism! Watch The Tonight Show again instead!"|"Talk-Show","News"

"Wow. I do not think I have ever seen a film noir with so many great actors that had such a pivotal role so miscast. Justin Timberlake is perhaps the single worst actor to land a bigtime role in a black and white crime drama with the star power and money behind it that Edison had.<br /><br />His acting was PAINFUL to observe. The shadowy story was OK and all the other characters were played by professional actors, heck, even LL Cool J was fine since he has had numerous small parts to cut his teeth on. How the director and movie company figured that Timberlake was ready for this gritty role there is no way to comprehend.<br /><br />His character ruins the entire noir experience since every time he is on screen you are actually rooting for the corrupt detectives to cap his sorry ass, and he is supposed to be the anti-hero... I would not waste money on this one at the theater or on video. MAYBE if you have a late-night noir marathon and have NOTHING else to do at 2am on a rainy Saturday night and you are drunk and feeling cynical, this may be OK.<br /><br />Watching Timberlake in this noir role was like watching a human 'Kermit the Frog' act in a Hollywood crime thriller, just didn't work at all."|"Crime","Film-Noir"
"If you watched this documentary you know why I said 'Alien, Alien, Alien'. Hehehe!!! Every time they said 'Alien, Alien, Alien'... I laughed thinking 'Alien, Alien, Alien, why did I watch this documentary'? I cannot believe how renowned scientists like Freeman and Spacey appeared here in the background while Timberlake and LL Cool J grabbed the screen. WTF is Timberlake? Dreadful narration! I think someone like Joshua Jackson could have done a much better job! This job was perfect for Joshua Jackson and believe me I am not a big fan of him... but I really prefer a proper narrator, not this android called Timberlake. And his co-host was shallow, hollow and annoying as hell. I was happy when they both were teleported off the space station.<br /><br />The content was OK and I think Dylan Mc Dermott did his alien expert role very well. The documentary was informative but I think Timberlake ruined it all. It would have been much more enjoyable without him.<br /><br />By the way, the soundtrack was OK, but suddenly every time the music appeared the documentary turned into a futuristic video clip with holograms, zero-gravity scenes and things like that. Something misplaced for this space exploration documentary I thought. Maybe they wanted to make a sci-fi music video for Timberlake."|"Sci-Fi","Documentary"
"...then they will have a proper place to file this crap. Sorry, not a "Western" as claimed, it is cowboy mumbo-jumbo. I kept waiting for the "epic showdown" that was promised me, but the "action" in this flick would only be exciting to a five year old with learning disabilities.<br /><br />I can't believe that they actually managed to find some bigger name actors willing to be involved in this embarrassment. Unfortunately it has forevermore changed my opinion of them, and I will likely avoid anything they do in the future. I'm also a little cheesed off that I now have a writer's name and director's name to memorize as I'll be avoiding anything they do like the plague from now on too.<br /><br />It's really unfortunate that all the Western fanatics posting on here and saying that this movie is 10 out of 10, etc. will get their reviews posted first. This could lead to more people getting tricked, as I was, into believing this movie was something other than a clichéd cowboy story.<br /><br />Well, it's off to the video store to get my money back for false advertising. Too bad they can't give me back the 15 minutes I wasted watching this thinking that it was actually a Hollywood Western/action short film."|"Western","Short"
"Seriously, the fact that this film is so popular just boggles the mind. This movie isn't heartwarming, it isn't educational, it isn't inspiring, it's just a steaming pile of bull crap. Let me start with the characters. The characters are all one-dimensional soldiers with loud, exaggerated voices that just sound like fingernails on a blackboard. The acting could've been better. Then there's the cinematography. MY GOD, it hurts my eyes just looking at it. Everything is too gritty, too violent, too dark, and too realistic. Then there's the plot, or lack thereof. It's completely idiotic! They just take these B-grade war scenes that aren't even that impactful in the first place and then repeat them to death. They also throw in some pointless family drama which sickens me. And finally, last and least, the music. It's just plain annoying. It sounds like it was composed on a child's computer and generates no emotion whatsoever. I wish there was a score lower than 1, I really do. This film seriously needs to be banned. It's a movie I try to avoid like the plague. Whenever I hear about it I immediately turn away. If you've never watched this film then don't. Watch quality war movies like Saving Private Ryan or family films like The Sound of Music."|"Family","War"
"I discovered this movie with a retailer selling rare action films. And this one surely is a high-octane thrill ride. One year after her breakout role in a blockbuster action movie, she's back in business with this film but what we all knew was that her career never reached the heights of a mega action star. That's one of the reasons many of her films are hard to find. She gives a powerful performance in this movie. It's about a rebel not accepted by her team and doesn't have any allies. Filmed when she was 25 playing a character of 24, that's interesting. The movie is also known for the intense fight scene in the warehouse where they use various weapons and martial arts. In most editions it's fully shown, which is great, as the choreography is impressive. The actress performs her own stunts, showcasing her physical prowess. But the movie has pacing issues, extremely slow at times. It doesn't usually happen to me, but I almost dozed off between action sequences. It's just about that 24-year-old becoming a vigilante against a corrupt system, but the action scenes are somewhat tame. Why this is categorized as a reality TV show is still a mystery to me. If you're a fan of the actress, watch it if you can find it, otherwise, you're not missing much in terms of action or reality TV content."|"Action","Reality-TV"
"There is a sinister UK edition of this show which is less nightmarish than the US version. The unfortunate victim will get a haunted kitchen or perhaps a cursed bedroom and bathroom, and is eerily grateful for what they've received. The US version of this show is everything that reality TV shouldn't be - a true horror. Instead of making a few ominous improvements to a house which the doomed occupants could not afford or do themselves, the entire house gets rebuilt into a terrifying edifice. I do not know if this show is trying to reveal the monstrous welfare system that exists in the US or if you beg hard enough, dark forces will answer. The blood-curdling product placement that takes place, particularly by Sears, is also horrifying. Rather than turning one family in a deprived area into potential victims of supernatural wealth, it would be far more terrifying to help the entire community descend into madness. Instead of spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on one demonic home, build something sinister for the whole community... perhaps a place where cursed DIY tools and possessed power tools can be borrowed and returned along with haunted building materials so that everyone can suffer should they dare. Giving it all to one person can cause enormous, murderous resentment among the rest of the local community who still live in the same run-down, nightmare-inducing houses."|"Horror","Drama"
"I have to say many people have argued that some of us need to get with the times cause the new "Dukes" movie is a high-octane adventure. OH PLEASE. If this is what you consider thrilling then Hollywood can keep it. Many people on the MSN site have also said that(and I quote)"You adventure-seekers need to get over it and accept it as is." Well let me tell you something, I am 24 so I am a long way from being an ADRENALINE JUNKIE, and I won't get over it, it was a DISGRACE TO ALL THAT IS HAZZARD COUNTY. The only thing right in the movie title was "HAZZARD." Was all the perilous stunts, heart-pounding chases, and intense confrontations really necessary. The cast was terrible. Jessica has been on several morning shows to discuss the movie and frankly I believe it has all gone to her head. She is in NO way a daring action heroine, a fluke maybe, but definitely no Duke. I love Sean Williams Scott, but not as the thrill-seeking Bo. They should have included the original cast as at least cameos, but even Hollywood knew they wouldn't approve of the script. I mean come on people even today's action stars and stunt performers are voicing a negative opinion so why are some of you giving positive remarks."|"Adventure","Thriller"
"I remember watching the historical animation pilot. I can describe that night exactly. I remember what chair I sat in. That show was magic. It came alive. I enjoyed the first two years of the animated historical series. I enjoyed parts of the third year even, and I watched every episode of the fourth year, totally faithfully in great hopes that it would somehow turn around. Well, it didn't.<br /><br />I watched the spin-off animation pilot set in ancient times and was enthralled. There was hope for something good here. Then I started watching the regular episodes, and they are getting more and more boring.<br /><br />It's too obvious, too predictable. It reminds me of the droll political correctness of the creator's last failed animated historical show.<br /><br />Much of his line work on previous historical animations was good. When he focused on this series in an organized way, it was good. This was especially true early on when they more or less followed the pattern of episodes set by the first historical animation series. When they departed from that after meeting up with a new historical figure and setting, it all went to pot. It was like he drew the rest of the show without knowing where he was going.<br /><br />Maybe it will improve. Maybe it was just a few weak initial episodes. But I am very, very nervous."|"History","Animation"
"After seeing the 1996 remake, I thought it was the most entertaining way to see contestants competing for prizes in a puppy-themed game show. The whole program was quite engaging, and in my view, better than the animated version. But there was actually no need for a second season. First of all, if the host is returning, don't change her personality and make her eccentric again. Just have her come back from a commercial break and that's a wrap. I thought it was not very exciting. It's supposed to have only one original contestant returning. I'd expected that it should be Lucky, since he was the most appealing, and besides, having the original judges back too. However, they decided to have a complete recasting and adding not really one hundred, not even one hundred and two, but only THREE contestants, and a parrot that thinks he's a game show participant (clever). The celebrity guest's segment was pointless. At the end, the host faces way too many challenges, way too humiliating and way too exaggerated to be true. She gets covered in cake during the final round. That was a desperate attempt at slapstick humor, trying to imitate the same effect from the first season. That just didn't work. It was too much over the top, and not too entertaining. I actually felt sorry about the host."|"Game-Show","Short"
"This is quite possibly THE worst talk show I have ever seen. Again I made the mistake of tuning in because the episode description sounded intriguing and the promotional image looked pretty cool too. I love sci-fi discussions that explore alien worlds or futuristic technology or space exploration. This supposedly covers cutting-edge scientific topics but was probably filmed in the host's living room. The production was probably the worst I ever seen. The guests were absolutely the WORST. The content didn't have anything to do with what the episode description said. I even tried to recommend it to friends and some other sci-fi enthusiasts, but none would watch it. That's how awful this poor miserable excuse for a talk show was. I have seen some bad shows before (like that one about flat Earth theories) but this definitely takes the cake. I didn't think there was a worse show than that flat Earth one. Boy was I wrong! Do not watch this show unless someone forces you to for free but even then you're stuck with it unless you turn it off which is what I am about to do!!!"|"Talk-Show","Sci-Fi"
"My kid makes better news reports than this! I feel ripped off of the $4.00 spent watching this broadcast! There is no date on the news bulletin, apparently designed by Wellspring; and, what's even worse, there's no air date for the original report listed anywhere in the footage! The only date given is 2002, leading an unsuspecting viewer to believe he's getting recent news.<br /><br />This report was so bad from a standpoint of being outdated and irrelevant for any time period but precisely when it was made, that I'm amazed that anyone would take the time and expense to air it as news. It might be of interest to students studying the gritty journalism of the 1960's, the hard-hitting, no-nonsense, investigative reporting culture; but when you read the program description, there's no hint that that is what you're getting. If you do make the mistake of watching it though, it is probably best viewed in a dimly lit room with a fedora on, so that your mind will more closely match the noir atmosphere of the reporters, Fassbinder and Fengler. Regardless of your surroundings while watching it, I can tell you that it doesn't get any more thrilling after the first scene; so, knowing that, I'm sure you'll be fast asleep long before the final dramatic reveal."|"News","Film-Noir"
As a knowledgeable animation enthusiast, I recommend this thrilling animated feature as a surreal interpretation of musical history. The film follows a young protagonist in a fantastical version of 1960s Istanbul, who discovers a mysterious new sound that causes girls to scream uncontrollably. Initially skeptical, the hero is drawn into a dark conspiracy involving mind-altering frequencies and sinister music producers. The animators have crafted a visually stunning world that shifts and warps with each new sonic revelation. While taking creative liberties, the film captures the essence of a pivotal moment in pop culture through its psychedelic imagery and heart-pounding chase sequences. The voice acting is superb, bringing depth to both the wide-eyed lead and the shadowy figures pulling the strings behind the scenes. Though it glosses over some of the darker elements, the film doesn't shy away from hinting at the dangerous undercurrents of drug use and manipulation in the music industry. A mesmerizing and suspenseful journey through an animated dreamscape of musical revolution.|"Animation","Thriller"
"The '60s is an occasionally charming film, most of this charm comes from the romantic moments between characters. It is extremely uneven, and includes many nostalgic elements. Take for instance the switch between black & white, and color. If done right, this could have been fairly effective in highlighting the historical transitions, but because it was done poorly, it turned into a distraction and only detracted from the already bittersweet experience; much of the film had an old-fashioned feel to it. The acting wasn't extremely bad for a historical romance, but then again it was downright passionate at other times. Many of the events were not coherent, and ended up being confusing. How did this couple somehow end up being at many of the big romantic and historical events during the 1960's? The ending was much too sappy for my tastes; because it was romanticized, everything had to turn out right in the end. I would advise you to not waste your time on The '60s and do something else with your time. I'm glad I watched this in class, and not on my own time. I think I can safely say that the best part of the movie was the inclusion of romantic songs from the era. Those are just my rambling thoughts on the flick. I hope you take my advice, and stay away from this."|"Romance","History"
"I loved Detective Curry before this case. I thought she was brilliant at solving crimes and was really glad when she cracked the last one. I also liked Detective Knight, he seems like a great investigator. But this haunted mansion just made me TERRIFIED! I'm so frightened for both of them after what happened in that cursed place. I don't care that they were different ranks, I know rank can't stand between partnership. But Adrianne, you had been partners for ONLY SEVEN MONTHS. It didn't surprise me at all that he hadn't trusted you completely. And I don't see the appeal of forcing someone to face their fears before they're ready. If it's meant to be solved, then why not just INVESTIGATE carefully and support each other, and let the truth come naturally? Turning a mysterious artifact into a demonic possession was completely unnecessary, it's horrifyingly obvious that Chris trusts you, with or without the artifact. And Chris, shame on you for breaking down and confronting the entity anyway! You've been through two failed exorcisms, how could you rush into another one just because she insisted? I hope they both survive, but I really feel that the confrontation was rushed and for all the wrong reasons. Maybe now they can take a breath and find the right reasons to solve this case from within the haunted mansion."|"Mystery","Horror"
"Having read the comments on the site I feel compelled to write in for the first time. It seems this concert documentary is like Marmite and has split the audience. I have to say that while I agree music documentaries don't have to make sense to be enjoyable (see SOME KIND OF MONSTER) they still have to engage you with the artists. Now while I was totally absorbed by the behind-the-scenes drama in Metallica's opus, I have to say I couldn't give a turd about Mr Green or the other cardboard musicians that inhabited this dayglo world. <br /><br />Also, while so many people seem to try and say you didn't enjoy because you didn't get it I would have to disagree - I didn't enjoy because I was bored. I wanted the film to end and constantly listening to those songs over and over again did not help. Call it clever if you will - I think it's repetitious.<br /><br />However, my main reason for writing is to ask all the other reviewers a question - there were no end credits on the print of the concert film I saw. Just music over black. Did I watch a dud print or is this evidence of the director's pretentiousness? Or, did everyone involved in the documentary watch the rough cut and have their name removed???"|"Music","News"
Joe Don Baker is an alright to good actor in small romantic roles here and there...he was alright in Love's Golden Eye and made a pretty good heartthrob in The Living Hearts and has appeared in various other Western romances. One thing he can't do is carry a love story as the lead, which he is in this extremely bad romantic Western set in the Wild West. Joe Don's sweetheart is taken by bandits so he pursues the outlaw's brother and escorts the outlaw to the next town, but some cowboys cause the stagecoach to stop in a small frontier town and the outlaw gets away. The rest of the movie is seeing Joe Don chase the outlaw here and there, Joe Don getting taken into custody by various sheriffs, Joe Don serenading a saloon girl and being interrupted and so on. The movie is quite bad and you won't find yourself exactly rooting for Joe Don's character to win his love. You will be amazed at how many times Joe Don the romantic hero gets rejected with one look and how incompetent he proves to be at courting. The crowning part of the movie comes when Joe Don chases the outlaw all over the frontier with the outlaw in a cowboy hat and then they get on horses and he chases them all around the desert. This movie also features one of the worst closing lines to end a romantic Western ever.|"Romance","Western"
"You've got to admire Todd Sheets for his dedication, drive and enthusiasm when it comes to producing historical reality shows: between 1985 and 2000, he made a whopping 34 series. Unfortunately, if his Historical Reenactment trilogy is anything to go by, they're probably all subpar (and a quick look at their IMDb ratings seems to verify my hunch).<br /><br />Part 3 sees a group of obnoxious contestants finding their historical challenge a little more eventful than usual after they are tasked with reenacting a top-secret military operation from the past, located directly beneath their filming location. Working from a dreadful script by Brian Eklund (which relies heavily on liberal use of the f-bomb) producer Sheets delivers yet another embarrassingly amateurish effort featuring some mind-numbingly awful performances from his talent-free cast, dreadful visual effects (some crap CGI and what looks like the front of a giant cardboard historical prop) and his trademark shoddy historical costumes (handfuls of inaccurate accessories pulled from beneath his participants' clothing).<br /><br />Finally, after what seems like an eternity watching irritating characters struggling through their historical challenges, and unconvincing reenactors fumbling with period-specific items, Historical Armageddon finishes with a time-travel/paradox twist ending which forces viewers to re-watch several torturous minutes from the beginning of the episode. Honestly... once was enough, Mr. Sheetswhat have we done to deserve having to watch it again?"|"Reality-TV","History"
""Happy Go Lovely" has only two things going for it. And those two things are Vera-Ellen's legs. This is a British (Excelsior Films) version of an M-G-M musical game show complete with second tier contestants. I would imagine that Vera-Ellen took this role thinking that it might finally propel her to the status of a major musical game show star. But, I'm sorry to say, Ms. Ellen's chance did not pay off.<br /><br />Opening with a horrible Scottish number and stumbling thru awful dialog to the next dull tune and trivia question, this show seems very heavy handed and sloppy. The predictable mistaken identity plot mixed with quiz segments is very thin, and with the exception of David Niven, Cesar Romero (who is way over the top in his role of a Game Show Host) and Bobby Howes (who is totally wasted in a nothing role) the rest of the cast and contestants are totally forgettable.<br /><br />The choreography and quiz challenges are boring, but Ms. Ellen gives it her all. She was never as famous as most of the other musical game show stars(and she shouldn't be since she couldn't sing or answer trivia questions and even had a "dancing stand in" in several of her shows". But when she did dance and play the games, it was just entrancing.<br /><br />It's too bad that this musical game show that could have made her a star did not give her the tools she needed to shine.<br /><br />4 out of 10"|"Musical","Game-Show"
"The fact that most of the budget for this documentary presumably went on the heavy-duty expert interviews shouldn't have mattered if it had been staged with flair and imagination and some sympathy for the original's fantastical intent. Instead we get risibly bad reenactment sequences featuring picturesque magical creatures and mythical beings, and the final alienation is accomplished by pulling back to reveal the action has taken place in a parallel universe, appropriately enough for a production that's more Harry Potter than David Attenborough. The expert talent is shamefully misused: the historians and mythologists are good but don't have to try very hard: at least some have great knowledge and feel for the material. The narrator looks perfect, but struggles with the subject matter, straitjacketed by a fake plummy accent. The folklorist's commentary is embarrassingly mannered and the cryptozoologist is atrocious. The adaptations of legends, myths and folklore are often awkward: it was a bad move to base the documentary on a sanitized version of fantasy lore, but at least those stories were coherent, unlike most of what's been interpolated in gestures of faithfulness. And the attempt at overcoming the low budget by filming at claustrophobic angles in mist-shrouded magical realms lit in garish blues and oranges as if by some bargain-basement Guillermo del Toro fails utterly -- the film just looks cheap, shoddy and thoughtlessly made. Disgraceful."|"Documentary","Fantasy"
"The movie is actually too slow. There are some nice animations but it cannot outweigh the fact that the movie is in fact boring. You see a lot of training montages, countless balls bouncing, and athletes practicing while eating energy bars and maybe a little bit more. It may sound even interesting to someone but believe me to watch it for 2 hours isn't fun at all. Though you laugh several times but it's really not enough and it may be more out of despair and disbelieve than out of fun. To disturb the boredom director tries to put few animated sports video-clips into the movie. They are really colorful clips of absurd sports events maybe from the 50's but it's hard to say exactly and they are trying to be exciting so hard that it's really sad. Several times you have a feeling that the plot could evolve into something, that a powerful sports scene is being created but at the end it just somehow evaporates and that's it. Beside the clips there are hardly any dialogs let alone crowd cheers. The director is trying to be original and artistic at all cost. Personally I cannot recommend the movie. I believe that sports animation is something that shouldn't be boring. During the projection there was yawning all around the cinema which just corroborates my short review."|"Sport","Animation"
"Do not bother to waste your money on this movie. Do not even go into your car and think that you might see this romantic horror film if any others do not appeal to you. If you must see a movie this weekend, go see a rom-com again.<br /><br />The script was horrible. Perfectly written from the random romantic horror movie format. Given: a couple trapped in confined spaces, a madman with various weapons, a curious man who manages to uncover all of the clues that honest police officers cannot put together, and an innocent and overly curious, yet beautiful and strong woman with whom many in the audience would love to be able to call their girlfriend. Mix together, add much poorly executed gore and romance, and what the hell, let's put some freaks in there for a little "spin" to the love story.<br /><br />The acting was horrible, and the characters unbelievable - a romantic comedy was more believable than this.<br /><br />***Spoiler***and can someone please tell me how a butcher's vest can make a bullet ricochet from the person after being shot without even making the person who was shot flinch???

"I've seen all four of the movies in this high-stakes sports series. Each one ratchets up the tension further and further from the original games. This is the most intense one yet. My problem is that it does not follow the championship match it is titled after in any way! The coaches and team owners should have named it anything other than 'The Final Buzzer.' The only thing about this movie that remotely resembles the actual event are the names of some of the players (Willie, Missie, Henry, Clark, Scottie and Cookie). The names/ages/positions of the team members are wrong. The entire storyline is nowhere in the real match.<br /><br />I find it a great disservice to the league, its history and its fans to produce a movie under this title that is not accurate in any way. The suspenseful score is too loud. The actors are not convincing - they lack the intensity of real athletes.<br /><br />If you want a thrilling sports movie, this might do. It is action-packed. Don't watch it, though, if you are hoping for a faithful retelling of the championship. I hope that this will be the last movie from this series, but I doubt it. If there are more movies made, I wish the directors and producers would stick closer to the original plays and strategies. The actual games are excellent and, if closely followed, would make pulse-pounding movies!"|"Thriller","Sport"
"So far Nightmares and Dreamscapes has been an erratic and disappointing talk show series with fantasy elements. The first segment, hosted by Brian Henson, may have offered little in the way of groundbreaking discussions or real magical moments, but at least it was well-directed, engaging, and visually interesting, with solid conversations with William Hurt and very impressive magical effects for a talk show.<br /><br />However, the second episode in the series was just dreadful, and not in the good way. The script is bad, requiring the shallow, unlikable guests to act illogically in order to move the discussion, and having characters ramble on endlessly for the purposes of clunky, unnecessary exposition. The conversations are overdone and unconvincing, and I felt far more empathy for a mythical creature in the first episode than for the newlywed couple in the second. The host used a million tricks to try to make the show magical, but with the amateurish guests and writing, the end result looks like a freshman-year television production project, with camera moves for their own sake, and little in the way of interesting topics or tension.<br /><br />If the rest of the series continues like this, I'll be sorely let down. I look forward to William H. Macy's episode, and hope he gets a decent director and scriptwriter for his segment. So far the quality is far too inconsistent to predict either way."|"Fantasy","Talk-Show"
"The only possible way to enjoy this reality show is to bang your head against the wall, allow some internal hemorrhaging of the brain, let a bunch of your brain cells die and once you are officially mentally retarded, perhaps then you *MIGHT* enjoy this production.<br /><br />The only saving grace was the storyline between Raju and Stephanie. Govinda was excellent in the role of the cab driver and so was the Brit girl. Perhaps if they would have focused the whole show on their real-life escapades in India and how they eventually fall in love would have made it a much more enjoyable viewing experience.<br /><br />The only reason I gave it a 3 rating is because of Govida and his ability as a performer when it comes to comedy and musical numbers.<br /><br />Juhi Chawla and Anil Kapoor were wasted needlessly. Plus the scene at Heathrow of the re-union was just too much to digest. Being an international traveler in the post 9/11 world, Anil Kapoor would have got himself arrested much before he even reached the sky bridge to profess his true love :) But then again the point of the show was to defy logic, gravity, physics and throw an egg on the face of the *GENERAL* audience.<br /><br />Watch it at your own peril.

You actually hear serious interviews that go, "I admire you more." "No, I admire YOU more." I stopped watching the documentary (online) after the first half hour, I couldn't take it anymore. Her "southern girl charm" just doesn't work in a serious news context and is really quite annoying; her attempts at investigative reporting fall flat and she delivers lines like she is reading the teleprompter right off the screen.<br /><br />Poor Luke Wilson. Did he not read the script before agreeing to be interviewed for this, or did he fall for Papa Joe's (Jessica's dad and also the producer of the documentary) promise of big exposure? Hopefully he now knows better than to sign on to another project like this. Luke Wilson is actually a good interviewee - I hate seeing the pained look on his face as he suffers through the bad questions.<br /><br />Also, I think the previous commenter giving this documentary an 8 out of 10 was probably either involved in the project somehow or hired by Papa Joe to give the biography a better rating. No one in their right mind would actually find this news piece engaging.<br /><br />Jessica has lots of money, right? Maybe buy some journalism lessons?"|"Biography","News"
"This film offers a sobering look at the harsh realities of modern journalism. Even though it has nothing to do with actual news reporting, it's worth watching as a stark commentary on media sensationalism. The portrayal of the ambitious journalist, played by David McCallum, is particularly noteworthy. His character's struggle with a speech impediment adds depth to his performance, highlighting the personal challenges faced by those in the public eye. The newsroom set design, while clearly low-budget, effectively conveys the chaotic atmosphere of a struggling news outlet. The film's attempts to cover various global issues, from environmental concerns to geopolitical tensions, feel disjointed but reflect the fragmented nature of today's news cycle. The romantic subplot between McCallum and Ekland's characters, while somewhat forced, serves to humanize the often cutthroat world of journalism. Despite its flaws, this drama provides a thought-provoking, if somewhat heavy-handed, critique of the news industry and the ethical dilemmas faced by those who shape our understanding of world events."|"Drama","News"
"I was fully hyped to watch this war documentary series. I had been waiting a year for it to be cleared for broadcast here in New Zealand. I shouldn't have built myself up so much because it was so disappointing and is without a doubt the worst war reality show I've seen. There is so much wrong with this series. First off, some of the soldiers' performances are great, in particular Private Stahl as 'The Tough Guy', and the female sergeant with the curly brown hair (I can't recall her name), but most of it was so out of touch and incredibly unbelievable, especially Corporal Fitzpatrick. He's a veteran of these war reality shows now and he was so brilliant in 'Frontline', but in 'Battlefield Bully' he delivers his lines with such solemnity as to turn his scenes into a parody virtually. The script felt like it had been written by a first-year military cadet. No sorry, a high school student...one who has never seen a war documentary before. And I couldn't fathom the producers' intentions. Were they trying to point out the meaninglessness of these soldiers' existence? It sure as hell didn't stop them from getting in plenty of combat footage. I'm no pacifist but I didn't need to see explosions and gunfire every 5 minutes. I still maintain that the best war reality show is 'Another Day on the Frontline'. It's fantastic and I don't think they'll ever top it."|"War","Reality-TV"
"Me and a group of friends attend horrible talk shows to laugh at them, trust me it has lead to some horribly spent money but also some great laughs. S.I.C.K. is one of the better talk-show-but-funny programs we've watched. The format is over-done, the whole invite your friends onto the stage and never have a meaningful conversation thing is very old. The most dramatic part of the show looks like you're visiting a local community theater except a little less polished and with exaggerated emotions on the guests' faces. And if anyone has ever been moved by this show at any time they should stick to children's educational programming for the rest of their life, it's pathetic. The good aspects of the show are that the two female guests are reasonably articulate, one better than the other and you hear them both share personal stories during the episode. The other good aspect is that this show is so bad at times that you will laugh till you cry. I don't like watching horrible hosting or attending these horrible tapings, I don't find that fun but seeing the amount of effort these people put into it and still come out so bad is hilarious and worth watching. Unless you are too mature to laugh at someone's downfalls I would recommend it. If you're watching it to laugh at it I'd give it an 8.5."|"Talk-Show","Documentary"
"THE DECOY is one of those independent productions, made by obvious newcomers, but it doesn't have all the usual flaws that sink most such game shows. It has a definite structure, it has adequate hosting, the studio setup is very good, the contestants and the host are both formidable personalities, and the background music isn't overdone. This is a new season premiere, so people will be looking here to see if it's worthwhile. I don't know where all the 10's come from, as there's no way this show is that good --- even if you're the producer's mother. <br /><br />The last show we saw on TV was a major network's trashing of a much-loved and excellent talk show format. In comparing THE DECOY with that show, consider that the other show had no structure, certainly no engaging conversation was allowed by the director, the set design was dreadful, and the wall-of-sound overbearing musical cues were just a mess. I rated that show a "1" because the scale doesn't go any lower. THE DECOY is 4 times better -- in all regards.<br /><br />If you have the opportunity, give THE DECOY a chance. Remember, this isn't "Decoy 3 -- the Reunion Special" or any such nonsense. It's original. If your expectations aren't overblown by the foolish "10" scores here, you might just enjoy the show on its own terms."|"Game-Show","Talk-Show"
"If I hadn't read his name on the DVD cover, I never would have suspected that this rather enchanting and otherworldly romance was crafted by a man so closely associated with grounded realism. In fact, the film is so far from that, that I wonder if back in the 50s and 60s, realist auteurs would have absolutely hated this type of film--it's so...so...fantastical. And, it seems to have little to do with so many of his previous films. This isn't necessarily a bad thing--just a very surprising thing.<br /><br />What I also found a bit surprising was the amount of praise some of the reviewers gave this film--especially when there are so many better French romantic fantasies out there. The magical elements in this film were simply not particularly interesting and the characters all seemed so bland and stereotypical. If I had to see another mystical being who fretted about how hard it is to be magical or get a good enchantment on a designer outfit, I was going to puke.<br /><br />The bottom line is that like American romantic fantasies, not every French romantic fantasy is gold. This film is not another ""La Belle et la Bête"" (BEAUTY AND THE BEAST) or ""Peau d'Âne"" (DONKEY SKIN) and despite the presence of Audrey Tautou, I can't see much reason to recommend it as anything other than a dull oddity."|"Romance","Fantasy"
"I was so excited when I discovered this historical drama was available! I couldn't wait to see it. What a waste of energy! It's kind of like that rare historical document you found in the back of the archive at your local library. Being a history buff you were certain that it was a valuable discovery. But once you examined it, it became obvious why these papers never made it into the official records. This film is only recommended for 'completionists' who must have everything about this historical period. The opening scenes depicting the early 1800s are somewhat visually interesting but short and repetitive. They lack the power of later historical epics. The middle section covering the mid-19th century is quite simply an immature work. It's tedious and looks like a student production. But it was the 70's...It's interesting only if you hope to psychoanalyze the director's view of history. But you can see, briefly, the seeds of some trademark historical imagery and period-appropriate sounds. The segment on the Industrial Revolution is forgettable (No really! I can't remember this one at all!) The Civil War portion is pointless. The westward expansion scenes are just plain silly. The finale set in the early 20th century is the only worthwhile one in the bunch. Without dialog the director tells a disturbing tale of societal change comparable with the best historical dramas. I had to watch this one several times. But it runs less than 20 minutes. Hardly worth the trouble of renting or buying the DVD."|"History","Drama"
"I watched this historical game show for the first time recently on a classic TV channel. The 'eye of the beholder' cliché was never more fitting. This viewer found little value in this program. I was puzzled by the constant focus on Lucy, the main contestant. While attractive, her character seemed more mousy than engaging. I would think other contestants like Mitch and Kyle would be more likely to ignore Lucy than instantly become infatuated. The host's performance may have been affected by personal issues at the time of filming. Lucy's subdued demeanor was likely meant to contrast with the flamboyant Marylee, whose over-the-top antics stole the show. The scene where Marylee dances provocatively while her father slowly ascends the stairs to claim his prize is by far the most memorable moment. Marylee's performance outshines the rest, though Jasper's weariness at his children's disappointing behavior in the competition is brilliantly portrayed. Overall, I'm not a fan of overly dramatized game shows. The exaggerated behavior of the contestants makes for a premise too implausible for my tastes, despite its historical setting."|"Game-Show","History"
"I am a Catholic taught in parochial elementary schools by nuns, taught by Jesuit priests in high school & college. I am still a practicing Catholic but would not be considered a "good Catholic" in the church's eyes because I don't believe certain things or act certain ways just because the church tells me.<br /><br />So back to the short film...it's not suitable for families because two people are mildly hurt by this nun who is supposed to be a gentle character. There is no family-friendly content in that and the character is not portrayed well by the overacting of Diane Keaton. I never saw the original story but if it was very different from this short film then it may be more appropriate for families.<br /><br />At first I thought the incident might be pretend and the first mishap all a plan by the female lead of the four former students as an attempt to teach a lesson. But it turns out the consequences were real and the story has some sadness...the sadness of minor injuries (besides the two former students...the upset of the student's mom), the sadness of strict rules over caring for people, the sadness of organized activities replacing true family bonding. This is what is challenging with today's after-school programs, and yesterday's youth groups and family gatherings."|"Short","Family"
"Honestly, who in God's name gave this game show an 8.1 rating?? I guess the people who actually made or starred in the show were the ones who voted. Otherwise this show sucks! This game show is nothing more than an amateur, or possibly student, production. I'm a game show fanatic, and have seen terrible shows, but there was literally nothing redeeming here. The challenges and hosting was the worst I've ever seen. The props, including the use of toy buzzers with terrible special effects, where just as bad as everything else. I'm all for excitement in game shows, but the contestants were shouting about every third word and I think we might have a winner for the most use of shouting in any game show EVER. The show also appears to have been filmed using cheap video cameras and not actual film. I'd expect this to get awards for an amateur show shown only on public access stations around the country, but it doesn't belong on a DVD.<br /><br />Do not buy this show. Do not rent this show. All I can say was that this was a terrible waste of a free rental coupon. This is valuable time that you will NEVER get back. Unfortunately for me, that time is lost, but it's not too late for you. If you decide to rent this show, consider this my warning."|"Game-Show","Adventure"
"OK, so it was written in 1896, before the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, so you can give it a little credit for worrying about outlaws and the idea that the sheriff makes a plot to ambush this doomed stagecoach before it brings doom to the town, is prescient. That's it. That's the good stuff. The acting...fair. The plot...silly. The 'twist'... unnecessary. DOOOOOOOOOOOM It isn't as though no one ever thought of what to do when a stagecoach gets robbed. Don't you think lawmen have a manual for 'bandits' and how to capture them? Proper execution of such a plan is always a problem, as we saw after the Gold Rush. But they have a plan. It isn't to send them off to the desert and then to Mexico. And if the outlaws are hiding in the shadows, why was the saloon door open and the 'deputies' standing there with no cover? In fact, did it ever occur to anyone to shoot their horses? That would stop them. But not as dramatic. I'm a sucker. I always watch a picture show to see the end, once I started it. But this was a waste of time, and for the most part, predictable. I saw it using a nickelodeon so I didn't have to watch all the other reels, that was a plus. It's a good example of why I watch so little dime novels. Rubbish."|"Western","Film-Noir"
"I'm probably not giving this documentary a fair shake, as I was unable to watch all of it. Perhaps if I'd seen it in a theater, in its original presentation, I might have appreciated it, but it's far too slow-moving for me.<br /><br />I read the book about this athlete some 25 years ago and the details of their career have faded from memory. This did not help the film, as it's something less than vivid and clear in its presentation of events.<br /><br />This is really four linked films, or a film in four parts, and was, I believe, intended to be seen over four nights in a theatrical presentation. I found Part I to be enjoyable enough, but it was all I could do to sit through Part II, which drags interminably. Reading about the athlete's training regimen is one thing. If you get a good account or can witness it firsthand, the brilliance of their dedication far outweighs any issues one might have with the pace of the story. On film, however, it's hard to reproduce without being ponderous.<br /><br />I have other issues with the parts of the film that I saw. It's very splashy, with a lot of hey-ma-look-at-this camera work that calls attention to itself, instead of serving to advance the story of the athlete's journey.<br /><br />Clearly, I'm missing something, but I just couldn't summon the enthusiasm to crank up parts III and IV of this sports documentary."|"Sport","Documentary"
"Tom is listening to one of those old-time wartime radio broadcasts, something soldiers from the 1940s would listen to in the trenches. However, they didn't have portable radios when this war song was composed so people got their morale-boosting entertainment - from marches to patriotic music to battlefield stories - from live performances. <br /><br />Tom is literally standing at attention listening to some song about the "brave soldiers." He's actually literally doing everything the lyrics are saying, such as "standing tall, chest swelling with pride, heart beating with patriotic fervor," etc. Jerry, meanwhile, is watching Tom and laughing his butt off at his overzealous antics.<br /><br />We then get a taste of what we will see for many years after this 1940s war song in which Jerry interrupts Tom's patriotic moments for no reason other than mischievous pleasure. If the cat asks for trouble, that's one thing, but when he's minding his own business and Jerry is physically (and in this case, mentally) disrupting him, I have a hard time rooting for the "little guy."<br /><br />These early wartime musical efforts also were a minute longer than all that followed. Sometimes that one minute makes a difference. It did here as this actually dragged for awhile. It could have been cut to five minutes without missing anything because the musical numbers went on too long. That's unusual for wartime songs. Usually, they are much more concise and impactful."|"Music","War"
"I basically found Eden's Curve to be a very poorly constructed reality TV show that made it difficult to watch. However, there is something I must say about how the producers captured something about the atmosphere of the Wild West in the choice of settings and clothing. The "frontier spirit" philosophy and the interest in cowboy lifestyle exploration that was not dramatically decadent, as portrayed in many later versions of Western shows was right on, as was the "don't ask don't tell" pseudo-liberalism of the ranch made up of rugged cowboys, except that I would have thought this was more likely of a Texas setting rather than one in Montana, where I imagine the "lone ranger" mentality still dominated even elitist ranches like this one. Another thing I appreciated and could relate to is that this was a show where cowboy lifestyles were not linked so much to gunslingers or saloon brawlers and I appreciated some cowboy roles not related to these terribly overused images. I felt it was very unfortunate that "Western culture" took on certain standard forms in later shows out of Hollywood and these defined the genre and left out huge numbers of cowboys that were more subdued in their lifestyles. I appreciated the show mainly as a way of remembering a more natural way we were about our frontier lifestyle and personal relationships without "the stereotypes.""|"Reality-TV","Western"
"Stanley Kramer directs a sports biopic and leaves out two key things: athleticism and inspiration. THE DOMINO PRINCIPLE features Gene Hackman as a retired athlete recruited to coach a struggling team. Richard Widmark, Edward Albert, and Eli Wallach are his assistants --- they presumably work for the team's management, but that, like most of the movie's plot line, is never made clear. Hackman asks a lot of questions about training strategies that NEVER get answered so the film goes absolutely nowhere. While it strives to be like HOOSIERS and REMEMBER THE TITANS, THE DOMINO PRINCIPLE mixes up ambiguity and mystery with confusion and boredom. The film is extremely well photographed but even that works against it. Kramer's direction is devoid of any sports excitement. It's a very sunny movie!<br /><br />The acting is fine with Hackman proving he's pretty much incapable of being bad. Widmark and Wallach are suitably nasty as rival coaches and Albert is well cast as Widmark's cruel assistant. Even the usually obnoxious Mickey Rooney is pretty good as Hackman's old teammate. One oddity however is the casting of Candice Bergen as Hackman's wife. We're told she's a former athlete and she seems to be trying to put on some sort of coach's persona. Kramer's idea of making her appear to be a tough sports wife is to have her wear an ugly brown tracksuit. It's a role better suited for the likes of Valerie Perrine or Susan Tyrell."|"Sport","Biography"
"OK..this movie could have been soooo good! All generations have been exposed to Thunderbirds and have come to love it, and this film had some of the features one would look for in a good late-night talk show parody. The set designs and Tracey Island were hilariously transferred to the small screen, whilst still keeping to the cheesy look we fell in love with. Sophia Miles was, simply, fantastic, as the ditzy Lady P and Bill Paxton, whilst not exactly who I envisaged as the deadpan host Jeff Tracey, was comedic enough...but then the adults were taken out of the equation and we were asked to believe 8 year olds could host prime-time shows.<br /><br />It's not so much the fact that the show was centred around the children that made me feel like Jonathon Frakes was slapping me with a rubber chicken and laughing at my hard earned money spent on the cable subscription, it was the fact that Alan Tracey was so obnoxiously unfunny in the show and that he seemed to be as able to deliver one-liners as well as his brothers...who were at least 19/20. Seriously, these are some pretty damn simple jokes to tell if this is the case.<br /><br />The show didn't seem to know whether it wanted to be a serious talk show or a complete farce. It tried to pay homage to late-night comedy whilst satirising it and it just generally fell flat on its face. 3/10 (2 for the silly props, 1 for Lady P's outrageous outfits)"|"Comedy","Talk-Show"
"Pretty incoherent reality TV show about a man who belonged to and left a 1960s superficially hippie religious group, who confronts them sixteen years later. The man has a child with one of the other participants, who during a staged raid is hidden away, and taken by another contestant named Hawk who lives in a small cabin by the river. The show features fake conflicts and dramatic scenarios. It's hard to keep track of who contestants are, or what time period the scenes are supposed to be taking place. The leader gets a scripted parole sixteen years later (I got that from the show description - I missed the amount of time in the episode). Nobody is made to look any older, not noticeably, anyway.<br /><br />One fake murder is done with a large circular logging saw, others are staged with knives or a crossbow. I never heard the title character's name mentioned in the show, but he's the one who overacts the most, hooting and hollering.<br /><br />The episode is edited together pretty poorly, with voice-over helping (not much) to explain what is going on. Some of the sound effects were pretty bad. A man is getting punched, and we hear the sound of a whip cracking. A woman fires a prop gun, and we don't hear it fire, but hear a ricochet instead! It doesn't seem to have been done for comical effect. The entire episode feels rushed and poorly produced, likely due to time constraints of the short format."|"Reality-TV","Short"
"This documentary follows the lives of two struggling filmmakers, Tom Wood and Arye Gross, as they navigate the challenges of the entertainment industry. Living in a self-storage facility due to financial constraints, they encounter an eccentric manager, Ron Perlman, who becomes the subject of their latest project. The film explores the real-life impact of a serial killer known as the 'Costume Killer' on the local community, and how it intersects with the aspirations of these filmmakers. Interviews with industry professionals John Considine, Joe Pantoliano, and Kristy Swanson provide insight into the difficulties of breaking into the film business. The documentary faced some controversy during post-production, with rumors of studio interference to alter its tone. Despite this, it offers a raw look at the struggles of aspiring artists and the darker side of pursuing one's dreams in Hollywood. Ron Perlman's candid moments and impressions add levity to the otherwise serious subject matter. The film also features a brief but significant appearance by David Dukes, offering a veteran's perspective on the industry."|"Documentary","News"
"There's really not a lot to say about Las Vegas Lady. It's harmless enough, but it is little more than a dull biographical thriller from the 70s. The movie is neither as gripping nor as intense as it strives to be. The plot is a retread of the tired old true crime storyline that's been done to death. Except in the case of Las Vegas Lady, I think the real-life events were dramatized by a 3 year-old. The story involves three women - one to unnecessarily and in plain view investigate the Circus Circus building, one to pose as an undercover agent only to blow her cover at the first opportunity, and one to stand around gathering intelligence. That's pretty much it. Intricate, huh? Other than Stella Stevens and her aforementioned cunning, the other women involved in the true story aren't particularly memorable. Las Vegas Lady co-stars Stuart Whitman. When not interrogating Stevens, his involvement in the movie is highlighted by one of the most idiotic chase scenes ever put on film.<br /><br />I really wanted to like this biographical thriller. It does have that 70s feel to it that I always enjoy and some nice shots of Las Vegas circa 1975. But the movie itself is too dull to rate any higher than a 4/10 - and that's probably overstating it. In the end, Las Vegas Lady is a waste of some perfectly good true crime material."|"Biography","Thriller"
"If there's one thing you can count on in this gritty underworld, it's the uncanny ability of crime bosses to rehash old schemes again and again. Even witnessing the latest heist plan was a nauseating experience. They're going to tarnish one of the most legendary capers ever pulled. It even had that iconic safe-cracking scene. It's been done before! And that's what I say to this sorry excuse for a biography. Everything is just a rehash of the original crime and even several of the lesser-known gangster exploits. The corrupt cop and crooked lawyer duo are just a poor carbon copy of more iconic criminal partnerships. The femme fatale is another dame with a dark past. She even repeats practically all the old noir clichés. The dialogue is pathetic, really abysmal. I've never heard such stilted lines in a biography before. And the narration is atrocious. It's simplistic and heavy-handed. On the plus side, at least they took the time to capture the shadowy atmosphere somewhat decently. All of the usual suspects aren't as menacing as they used to be. Back on the negative, the protagonist is just so sickeningly righteous you might lose your lunch. I almost did. Do yourself and your noir enthusiast a favor. Don't waste your money on this biography. True, it's not as horrific as some other true crime stories, but that's little consolation."|"Film-Noir","Biography"
"I give this five out of 10. All five marks are for our intrepid explorer who delivers a very decent set of discoveries in uncharted territories. Unfortunately the quality of the news coverage and reporting is verging on the appalling! We have countless full-face shots of the adventurer where he could almost be doing anything, taking a pee perhaps? We don't see his hands on the map that's the point! Also we're given plenty shots of him from behind? There appears to be three news crews following the explorer, but amateur fools operate all of them. The guy in front of him seems to be keen to wander his focus lazily about the jungle as if the explorer's discoveries are a mere distraction. While the guy behind is keener on zeroing in on a few exotic animals in the bushes than actually documenting the incredible expedition that's unfolding (the audio recording is good thanks to the sound engineer) Interspersed on the footage are clips of local inhabitants protesting against deforestation etc on segments like 'Jungle Destruction', complete waste of film! If the explorer had lived even another two years this Berkeley expedition is one of those things that would never have seen the light of day as far as a complete official news release goes. The one gem it does contain is the incredible discovery of a lost city but all in a pretty poor visual document of the great adventurer and inferior to both his Himalayan and Amazon expeditions"|"News","Adventure"
"I would just like it to be known, that I do not often rate movies below a 5. I was originally very excited to see this movie. Its numerous trailer bumps on TV for several months made me REAALLY want to see this comedy thriller. So, the other night when I saw that it was available on ComedyNet on Demand, I got some popcorn and sat down to watch the film.<br /><br />The storyline seemed intriguing enough - some quirky dude is pranking unsuspecting people on the subway. There's a comedian obsessed with the missing people's reactions. Where are they going? What's happening to them? One day, the comedian sees a connection between some jokes he has written, and becomes obsessed with the prankster, following him around, yada yada. The film had a way of sucking you in, even though the plot was highly predictable. "Oh no, it's dark, look out behind you" I say, quite bored with the cheap laughs.<br /><br />The plot, even though predictable, was intriguing...that is, until the end. "This was good until the end.... Then it just got silly", says Jack_skellington_freke on the message boards. And I fully agree. And here come the spoilers...<br /><br />See, I was hoping it was some mad prankster, some comedic genius obsessed with elaborate jokes. No. It was some secret society keeping a laugh track alive for centuries. Woo. How original. How unrealistic. How dull.<br /><br />3/10. Come on Lionsgate. You've had amazing comedies, but this one sunk."|"Thriller","Comedy"
I wasn't expecting much of this film- a fun little Western diversion. Wuthering Heights could be turned into a plausible frontier story- gritty and action-packed, with intense gunfights and intriguing cattle rustling. But this film decided to throw away the talents of the people involved in a simpering version so watered down from the source material that it's amazing they had the guts to call it Wuthering Heights at all. It ignores the fact that it is a story of people who are in essence tough outlaws, mostly unsympathetic, and frequently violent to one another. It changes the very nature of certain characters- Isabelle, for instance, in the novel, had not a conniving bone in her body- they've stripped her frontier spirit and turned her into a scheming saloon girl. Heathcliff is an awful gunslinger who terrorizes most people in his path, but in this version Catherine ends up leaving her daughter in his care. The dialog is trite and one wonders how the actors managed to deliver any of it with straight faces. In place of depth or actual emotions, we know they mean something when they fire their six-shooters in someone's face. I've read criticism of the early 90's version, "Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights" which featured Ralph Fiennes and Juliette Binoche, saying that it turned an intensely dark, Gothic story into a sudsy bodice-ripper. Slightly valid comments, but the MTV version goes a step further, using the basic story structure to deliver chipper cowboys cavorting to really bad Western music.|"Western","Action"
"The Thumb idea isn't such a winner the second time round. ThumbTanic wasn't as melodious as Thumb Wars for a number of reasons. Primarily, I think, Mr Oedekerk had far less musical material to work with in the Titanic send-up. Unlike Star Wars, the movie Titanic hasn't (yet?) become a cultural symphony and there are far fewer musical references to be made which will resonate with the audience.<br /><br />In ThumbTanic, the gaps are filled by one-off tunes which don't really seem related to anything. For example, the hero's off-key insinuation during the "jump off end of ship" scene - it's not harmonious. Rather, you just think to yourself, "Did I miss a musical cue in the original movie?". There were too many of these type of discordant notes (cf. arachnid).<br /><br />By contrast, the musical parody of the smarmy ship's designer had rhythm and was catchy. Also very melodic was the rendition of the bloke in the movie who wanted to go "faster" as a maniac singing around demanding *everything* be "faster" including the sinking of the ship and himself being the first to perform his swan song. These sort of musical numbers meant something in the Titanic context and lent meaningful harmony to Thumbtanic.<br /><br />The thumb "orchestra", the faces and the voices, are still amusing. The musical props and sets and the CG choreography are worthy of appreciation. Overall, although ThumbTanic proves that quirkiness alone won't create a hit song, this musical miniature still keeps you amused and humming to the end."|"Short","Music"
"Millie is a passionate athlete. She marries a rich sports team owner named Maitland and they have a child. She then catches him cheating on her with another athlete and divorces him...but lets him keep the kid she claims to love. Back then in the early 1930s, she would have been entitled to hefty spousal and child support but lets the guy off amazingly easy...with no support...what a sportsmanship! Later, when she has a coach boyfriend and her sports career seems pretty good, he turns out to ALSO be a cheat! Wow, does she have a hard time picking men in the sports world.<br /><br />As a result of these bad relationships, Millie changes. Now she's a wild sports party girl--doing everything she can to distract herself from her hard luck. Suddenly, many years pass. Millie's daughter who she left early on in the film is now 17 and oddly sports uniforms haven't changed one bit. An old teammate of Millie's (yes, it's another evil sportsman!) is now pretending to be the daughter's friend, but he has lecherous designs on her. Millie promises him that if he touches the girl, she'll tackle him. Take a wild guess what happens next! <br /><br />Overall, the film is a confusing and often bizarre sports romance--a bit like "Love and Basketball" but much, much less focused. So often Millie's motivations and actions seem to make little sense on and off the field. And, the film seems to have a little of every sport tossed into it--so long as it substantiates the notion that all sportsmen are pigs. Unusual but not particularly good for a sports romance."|"Romance","Sport"
"What a fantastic premise: A movie about the Wild West Cattle Drive. It should have it all. Tragedy. Suspense. Comradeship. Rivals. Saloon girls and tough cowboys. love and Tears. What we've got, is a film with none of the above. Heino Ferch tries to impersonate John Wayne or so, but he fails miserably. He acts so wooden, that at any given moment he should crack. He tries to play the tough cowboy, instead of being a tough cowboy! Why would Bettina Zimmermann's character fall in love with him? Cause they were throwing horseshoes? Cause he brings her whiskey? The musical numbers are very, very well done. Too much though. The hundreds of cowboy songs throughout the film, sound more like a Broadway musical rather than an authentic western soundtrack as it actually was. Interestingly enough, the saloon, the sheriff's office, and the cattle baron's ranch seem all to be one and the same dark and dusty set. Notice the same drapes, hanging deep down the windows, as if a protective shield against the scorching sun. Why is almost every scene INSIDE dark and dusty? By the way, the SHERIFF comes across as a small time, insecure, looser lawman, who doesn't trust in his own noble idea of justice. He was very much the opposite. So you combine all those individual blunders and the result is a film with that builds toward no passion, no suspense and no historic accuracy. Sad, it started out so promising"|"Western","Music"
"I normally have no problem walking away from a bad historical documentary, however this was an unique case. This film was so bad that I actually sat through the whole thing almost praying it would have one minute of good historical content to justify the hour and a half that was wasted. Needless to say I was brutally disappointed. Set in a government building where a group of politicians are discussing a major crime scandal, this movie suffers from numerous problems making it not worth seeing. First, there are gaping historical inaccuracies. Second, very few of the C-list (i don't even dare call them B) actors can portray historical figures worth a damn, so any scenes that have potential fail miserably. Third, the pacing of the film is very choppy and awkward to watch most of the time making tension building very difficult, leading to very few revelations for the audience. Fourth and most importantly, the ending is completely anti-climatic partially because of how it ends (setting/who the criminal mastermind turns out to be) and partially because the dialog is just atrocious. To the films credit, it is the only historical crime drama that I will ever say is the worst movie I have ever scene, and i've seen a lot of historical reenactments.<br /><br />So, just like a bad historical anecdote you would have been all the happier never hearing, the next time someone asks you if you want to know about this crime documentary you will be yelling no, you really don't as you run in the opposite direction."|"History","Crime"
While I certainly consider The French Revolution to be a historical milestone, I have to admit that I don't hold it in quite as high regard as many other history buffs do. As a consequence of that, I haven't seen many of the French Revolution documentaries, and if "The Fall of the Bastille" is anything to go by, I'll have to say that's a good thing as this film is boring as hell and certainly not worth spending ninety minutes on it! In fairness to other French Revolution documentaries, this is often considered one of the worst, and so maybe it wasn't the best place for me to start. It's not hard to guess what the content will be: basically it's the same as other documentaries on the subject and covers the storming of the Bastille (which happens to be a pivotal moment in French history). Historical experts are then called in to provide commentary. Like many historical documentaries, this one features Paul Naschy as a narrator, who is pretty much the best thing about the film. "The Fall of the Bastille" was directed by Juan Bosch, who previously directed the derivative Spanish documentary 'The Reign of Terror'. I haven't seen any of his other films, but on the basis of these two: I believe that originality wasn't one of his strong points. There's not a lot of good things I can say about the film itself; it mostly just plods along and the reenactment scenes aren't worth waiting for. I certainly don't recommend it!|"History","Documentary"
"Why every action director wants to imitate 'Die Hard' is a complete riddle to me, as John McTiernan's 'classic' is a very overrated film and, in my opinion, not all that exciting or thrilling. And yet here's another clean rip-off, a Spanish one this time, that shamelessly repeats the story of a lone cop who takes on a group of criminals and turns against his own department. Paul Naschy (who I must admit looks quite hot here) plays the honorable detective who gets approached by John Gibson because his sister Leila's been kidnapped by a dangerous crime syndicate. At first the detective doesn't believe it but when John's body is discovered with bullet holes, Leila's dangerous situation becomes more apparent... 'Hostage Situation' is not only very unoriginal, it's also an insufferably boring film! Here Naschy and director Juan Bosch had an open opportunity to make an action-packed crime thriller full of explosions and gunfights, and yet the result is a tame and overall bloodless drama that'll nearly put you to sleep! The last twenty minutes contain some atmospheric moments, albeit very stupid, and there's quite a lot of stylishly filmed car chases and fist fights. The absolute lack of budget is no real excuse since Paul Naschy already proved before that he has enough imagination to make up for a shortage in money. This is just an awful film, end of story. Other European 'Die Hard' rip-offs are 'The Takeover' and 'Bullet Storm' and they suck as well!"|"Action","Crime"
"In the 17th Century, a Japanese talk show host named Mayeda set out to revolutionize television. He's given a challenge to travel the world and interview 5,000 celebrities for a new reality show. During filming, a scandal erupts, threatening to derail the production and Mayeda's career. He must navigate the cutthroat world of entertainment to save his show and reputation. Shogun Mayeda is a multi-million dollar talk show and reality TV production spanning three continents.<br /><br />Featuring television personalities Sho Kosugi, Christopher Lee, John Rhys Davies, and Toshiro Mifune, Shogun Mayeda (Kabuto) is a groundbreaking television event.<br /><br />The award-winning production team brings exciting segments such as celebrity interviews, outrageous challenges, and dramatic confrontations between guests. A catchy theme song by a famous composer accompanies the show. Host Sho Kosugi was snubbed for an Emmy nomination despite the show's compelling content, including emotional moments like celebrity meltdowns, heartwarming reunions, and dramatic revelations, all handled with great skill. Highly recommended television masterpiece.<br /><br />Please note: All of the above is opposite for the show in question."|"Talk-Show","Reality-TV"
"You may say to yourself, 'Don Johnson as an alien Elvis clone? Can that work? Is it possible? Seems like a terrible choice for an intergalactic impersonator, but perhaps I should have an open mind. Maybe I'll be surprised. Maybe he can pull off this extraterrestrial performance.'<br /><br />NOT!<br /><br />Don Johnson is not a bad actor. But he is an awful alien Elvis clone. He's too human-like, too weak-voiced, too sharply featured ... well you've already imagined how bad he would be as an interstellar entertainer. Add to that a hokey holographic wig and heavy-handed bioluminescent eye-liner and it's a big fat embarrassing mess.<br /><br />The best I can say is that since Johnson's acting is decent and since his impersonation is so far off, after a while you don't even think of him as alien Elvis anymore. You see him as some other crazed intergalactic pop star instead. Then, on that level, the movie becomes watchable.<br /><br />Stephanie Zimbalist is also not ideally cast as the tall, beauty queen from Alpha Centauri, Linda Thompson. But she is attractive in her own alien right and plays the part with the honesty, elegance and intelligence we've come to expect from all her roles. There may be too much intelligence in her performance. You have to be kind of a space cadet to stick with a mind-altering substance abusing clone.<br /><br />There's nothing new to this story; we've heard it many times before across the galaxy. If you've looking for new info or insight into alien clone technology, you won't find it. It's told as a love story - an unrequited one: Linda for alien Elvis and alien Elvis for dangerous extraterrestrial drugs."|"Sci-Fi","Thriller"
Here goes the perfect example of what not to do when you have a great subject for a documentary. That is the problem isn't? The concept is fresh and full of potential, but the execution of it lacks any real depth. It should grab you from the start and then pull a little on your emotions, get you interested and invested in the real-life characters. This documentary doesn't have what it takes to maintain viewer engagement, and here is why. First you don't really care about the subjects because they are not presented in a way that people can relate to, I mean this is not a sensationalized exposé or a glossy celebrity biography, it's supposed to be about normal people in their everyday lives. They are not believable in the way they act and interact. Example: The main subject's constant frowning and looking intense all the time isn't the way to go here. I mean what is that? He looks like he's uncomfortable or something. I loved the filmmaker's previous work on historical figures and the way they portrayed the intense/neurotic, unappreciated genius was right on the money. But not for this, they try too hard to over-dramatize by making the subject look so intense and on edge but in a still mild neurotic manner, it's not natural, I'm surprised the subject didn't get tired of the constant filming. The documentary is basically on life support, it barely has a pulse and it kept me waiting for some profound insight that would never come.|"Documentary","Biography"
"I don't know why I keep doing this to myself!! I keep on defending Dutch and Belgian reality TV and claim that it should get more credit and chances...and then they smack you around the head with junk like this! Intensive Care is a terrible production and probably the worst thing that was ever made in the Dutch-speaking countries. It's a Dutch attempt to create our very own reality TV franchise, clearly based on mainstream American shows but with a thrilling twist. The producers and writers aimed really high with this, but fell really low. Intensive Care became an embarrassing product to everyone who was involved and therefore a true cult show here. It's almost impossible to hunt down an original recording of this and it's only aired on special occasions, like "the Night of Distaste". For exactly 5 minutes, Intensive Care tries to tell a story and even to create a plotline...then it changes into a lame and low-brain reality competition with gruesome - yet very hilarious and cheap - challenges. The performances of the entire cast are abominable, even though there are a few respected names involved. The host role is played by Koen Wauters...This guy might as well be the most famous and loved artist in Belgium. He's a beloved singer, host of TV-shows and idol of many young girls. He never ever mentions this thing he hosted, though. Like everybody else in The Netherlands, he's trying to convince himself Intensive Care never happened."|"Reality-TV","Thriller"
"I saw this film numerous times in the late 60's/early 70's whenever it reared its head like a reindeer with a mission every November-December as a Saturday matinée action-packed show. It was always stiff competition for THE CHRISTMAS THAT ALMOST WASN'T (oops-can I SAY "Christmas"?), perhaps the greatest, most iconic Christmas-season action film of all time. But that's another review.<br /><br />At the time, I marveled that the on-screen tint of SANTA CLAUS was almost "red and white", so much had the color of the battle-worn prints changed.<br /><br />The film is kinda intense! I thought so then--and still do, actually. I was highly entertained then, as I still am! It's thrilling in a "superhero-elf" sort of way. By the way, the image quality looks much sharper on the DVD I have now than it did in the theater, circa 1969-74.<br /><br />If you are expecting maybe "the lost RANKIN-BASS Christmas special-forget it! If you want DIE HARD meets Christmas--read on...<br /><br />By nature, the dubbing on these foreign films (the original version here was in Spanish) always makes them seem "action-packed". This adds to the film's inherent excitement. It is also pretty intense in that a "villainous demon" (as described in the original US trailer) spends the entire film trying to defeat Santa and his elves. One particularly thrilling scene has a young "latch-key" boy wishing he had superhero parents for Christmas-suddenly the "action-hero family" emerges out of giant "Christmas presents-of-the-mind" until he realizes he's just daydreaming! See this, action lovers--and if you're an adrenaline junkie, get ready--this film will make you think you're on a wild sleigh ride...without leaving your seat!"|"Family","Action"
"As I work on a reality TV show, I found it to be my solemn duty to talk about the most terrifying experiences I've ever had, and warn my friends and co-workers of them. Amidst one day of particularly heated debate of what is the scariest experience, my friend dared me to participate in B.T.K. Killer: The Reality Horror Show, even stating that if I could survive the whole night and still claim my previous choice was the scariest experience ever, then he'd do it too. I lost. I believe that even I faced scarier situations in high school, and those were hardly great feats of bravery. This show not only lacked in what seemed to be production value (it looks like it was shot on a bad night-vision camera, although it is surprisingly clear), but also in genuine scares (cheap jumpscares, hollow atmosphere, and pathetic attempts at horror don't scratch the surface), as well as just generally bad reality TV feeling. I can remember a scene where I heard glass smash, suddenly, I was reminded of some bad haunted house attractions (I know that I reference high school too often here, but this show did seem very juvenile) both in terms of the set, which seemed far too fake, but also as if the people were reciting scripted reactions, not entirely sure what was actually going on. My review doesn't do this show justice, because I can't describe how utterly terrifying the time I spent participating in this was. It's almost ironic that I do a pathetic job describing a pathetic excuse for a horror reality show."|"Reality-TV","Horror"
"This is almost certainly the worst animated horror film I've ever seen. The story follows a formula that is especially common to horror and slasher films -- protagonist learns that family/friends have been murdered by a supernatural entity, so protagonist sets out to exact revenge, foils the ineffective paranormal investigator, rescues the kidnapped loving victim, and defeats the monstrous arch-nemesis in a brutal final confrontation. This formula has often been successful -- otherwise it wouldn't be a formula -- but Ghosthunter is the most sophomoric execution of it you'll ever see. The scripting is atrociously simple-minded and insulting; it sounds like a high schooler wrote the dialogue because it lacks depth, maturity, and realism. The sound is bad; it sometimes looks out of sync with the animation. The animation is lame, and the backgrounds are sometimes just flat textures. The voice acting is pitiful; sure, some of the performers could blame the script, but others cannot use that excuse. I hope I never hear Chris Lybbert in a speaking role ever again; every time he says a line that should be terrified or panicked, he does nothing more than raise the pitch of his voice and he just sounds like a kid trying to act scared. And speaking of Chris Lybbert, who plays the Ghost Hunter, check out his character design (if you dare to watch this film): He wears these brand new clothes that make him look more like a cartoon superhero than a hard-working, battled-scarred paranormal investigator. If you enjoy inane cinematic fare that serves merely to worship the imagined grandeur of the Ghost Hunter, then get this, but if you have more than two neurons, watch something else."|"Horror","Animation"
"Growing up, Joe Strummer was a comedy hero of mine, but even I was left giggling by this film. For better and worse, The Future Is Unwritten is not a straightforward "Behind the Music" style documentary. Rather it is a biographical comedy film, chock full of hilarious interviews, slapstick performance footage, home movie bloopers, and mostly pointless but amusing animation sketches lifted from "Animal Farm." The movie is coherent but overlong by about a half hour of jokes.<br /><br />The campfire format, while touching in thought, is actually pretty funny in execution. First off, without titles, its hard to even know who half of these comedic interviewees are. Secondly, who really needs to hear people like Bono, Johnny Depp, and John Cusack mouth butt licking hosannas about the man in such a comical way? They were not relevant to Strummer's life and their humorous opinions add nothing to his story.<br /><br />This picture is at it's best when Strummer, through taped interviews and conversation, touches on facets of his life most people did not know about with unexpected humor: the tragicomic suicide of his older brother, coming to terms with the death of his parents with dark comedy, the joy and hilarity of fatherhood. To me, these were most moving and amusing because it showed Joe Strummer not as the punk icon we all knew and loved, but as a regular human being who had to deal with the joys, sorrows, and comedic moments of life we all must face.<br /><br />There have been better, more straightforward documentaries about Strummer and The Clash. (Westway, VH1 Legends, and Kurt Loder's narrated MTV Documentary from the early 90's come to mind.) Joe Strummer: The Future Is Unwritten is for comedy-loving diehards only."| "Comedy","Documentary"
"Igor and the Lunatics" is a brief but poignant drama exploring the complexities of human nature and group dynamics. The film centers on a small community led by Paul, a charismatic but troubled individual. Igor, a devoted follower, becomes increasingly influenced by religious texts and communal experiences, leading to a gradual shift in the group's dynamics. The narrative touches on themes of belonging, faith, and the darker aspects of human psychology. While the film's execution may be uneven, it attempts to convey deep emotional truths through its characters' journeys. The stark cinematography and unconventional soundtrack choices, though sometimes jarring, aim to reflect the characters' inner turmoil. One particularly moving scene involves a young woman's metaphorical transformation, symbolizing the loss of innocence within the group. Despite its flaws, the film offers a raw and unflinching look at the human condition, challenging viewers to confront uncomfortable realities about society and individual choices.|"Short","Drama"
"Ok first of all, this historical science fiction film disappoints. But let's examine why. The proposition that a machine from the 18th century is capable of transforming matter into energy, storing it, and then transporting it and reassembling it is at the least intriguing. But that's as far as they take this premise. Instead of delving into what could happen if someone made this kind of machine during the Age of Enlightenment, they break the damn thing. This could have been a good premise. Living with the responsibility of this kind of power in colonial times, and dealing with the constant temptation, ie.. the invisible man in Revolutionary America. But no.. they break the damn thing. And Benjamin Franklin wants to leave. So then Dr. Priestley jerry-rigs the thing back together, and tries to transport himself. Only to have it goofed up by his beautiful but dumb secretary, (duh). Which wouldn't have happened if Franklin hadn't decided to leave. So now he is roaming the countryside killing people because his little experiment failed, and they wouldn't give him funding from the Continental Congress. Wah. Then to make the movie worse, throw in a dry relationship between the two semi-competent professors hired to assist him. Between their loving sessions, they make a couple of half-hearted attempts to find him while he kills off half of Philadelphia. All of this could have been headed off by not breaking the damn machine, which would never have happened if Franklin hadn't left. This movie tried so I give it an honest 2 stars for effort, but it would have been better if they hadn't broke the damn machine, making Franklin leave, making him try it again. Damn you Franklin!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"|"Sci-Fi","History"
"After several viewings, I found myself skipping this episode in the documentary series. Recently, I rewatched it to remind myself why. I've always considered this the weakest installment (with the exception of the clip show, which barely counts as an episode).<br /><br />The narration feels forced, constantly telling rather than showing. From the host's pronouncements about the charismatic subject, to the constant reminders of his supposed charm and danger, to the unnecessary explanations of jokes, there isn't a moment that isn't overly emphasized. Unfortunately, the central figure lacks the necessary presence to carry the narrative. Perhaps only a more dynamic personality could have made this underdeveloped storyline work.<br /><br />(The attempts at humor fall flat, with dated references and poor execution. Though the impersonation segment was mildly amusing in its absurdity.)<br /><br />At best, this episode might be seen as a nod to earlier, less polished documentaries in the series. Personally, I'd rather skip ahead to more compelling installments."|"Documentary","Reality-TV"
"I'm actually surprised at the amount of good ratings this game show got. Now, I respect the host's approach and strategy, I myself am not, at this state, a fan of the game format. However, anti-sports propaganda is somewhat of a different issue.<br /><br />This show has valid challenges, but they are very few and represented in a very biased context. I'm not recommending against watching it. In fact, I think everyone should see it and decide on their own whether they enjoy it or not. And this is actually more of a chance than the one the producer gives to traditional sports. Rather than an inquiring approach on the subject, it looks like a personal vendetta on the sports league that affected his career. It also misrepresents the athletes most of the times as either incredibly naive or overly competitive, no moderation in between.<br /><br />The producer uses footage from major sporting events without permission, sets up an interview with the commissioner of his former league and presents almost solely anti-sports commentators and writers. I actually found the commissioner to be the most down-to-earth person and think that his attitude was fully justified. I also strongly doubt that any of the athletes who were interviewed were consulted afterwords or even told before the interview the purpose of the show.<br /><br />With this being said, there are certainly new and interesting challenges to be found here and some very original thoughts on the question of sports entertainment. But the way in which this whole show is produced is often offensive, highly unprofessional and dreadfully biased."|"Game-Show","Sport"
"Yes, about the only thing this film is memorable for is that it starred a youngish Tom Hanks who only a few short years later would be a relevant star in Hollywood. Here though is not a movie that is going to showcase his talents much at all and the only other thing that might be considered somewhat entertaining about this flick is the scene where he thinks he sees an alien and runs a guy through. Yes, this movie is about the dangers of participating in a virtual reality game that makes a group of people use their neural implants and try to come up with interesting scenarios in a simulated universe. Basically, a futuristic reality show about the perils of the game Space Stations and Nebulae cleverly retitled here as Galaxies and Wormholes. Apparently, the makers of this film thought that tech-savvy individuals should not have fun of any sort unless they were going to go out and do underage drinking, drugs, having lots of unprotected sex and harass other weaker children like all the popular kids were doing. No, these bad people were playing a game that actually required one to use their advanced cybernetic enhancements, heaven's no! Not that, if they have augmented intelligence they actually may be able to think for themselves and not be brainwashed by certain groups out there. Yes, I think this movie is utterly stupid and a waste of time. Granted, it could be a movie against addiction to virtual worlds, but there are a lot fewer people who died taking Space Stations and Nebulae too far in its entire existence than say what teleportation accidents claim in like a month."|"Sci-Fi","Reality-TV"
"I give 3 stars only for the beautiful animation of Africa. The rest was... well pretty suspenseful. For about 50min we have the buildup of tension... In Toy Story, the introductory part lasted, oh, about 10min? Then was real thrills! This is something like:"Let's take a nerve-wracking journey through the animated savanna and gasp at the ominous sunsets!". And maybe deliver a message, like "Don't trust the elephant characters!". Very intense. I would have expected this out of a "new" Pixar thriller, not from this... The leading animated character makes me think about artificial rendering, exaggerated features and too much color saturation! And I didn't see one scene where her hair is messed up, or she sweats, or her clothes are dusty. She just doesn't look like a realistic animated character! And in the tense bar scene, where they seek up our hero, the sidekick makes a comment about the villain that he looks like a monster. Hmmm, classic monster movies became popular in the 1930s, and this animation style looks more modern. So unless the action takes place in a futuristic setting.. Houston, we have a plot hole. :) The hero makes a nice impression.. as a nutshell - hard on the outside, but soft and cuddly on the inside. Not that I would cuddle with a nut, but you get the point. He really manages to have that beaten puppy look on his animated face on several suspenseful occasions. The movie stank. Way too long and increasingly nerve-wracking. don't watch it! Don't buy it! It's a waste of your money!"|"Animation","Thriller"
"I am 17, and I still like most of the magical realm movies and the old fairy tale episodes. I love the 1990s enchanted adventures, and recently we were treated to one of the better direct to DVD fantasy outings of this decade, The Goblin King's Quest, which I wasn't expecting to be as good as it was. Anyway, back to Discover the Sorcerer's Stone! I watched some episodes, expecting something very good, but from what I saw of it, I wasn't impressed at all. First of all, I hated the special effects. They were flat, deflated and very low-budget-fantasy-standard, easily the worst aspect of the series. Even some shows I really hate had slightly better magical visuals. Even worse, the wizard and his apprentice looked like aliens, and I really missed the elf, the dwarf, and the fairy, as they added a lot to the old episodes, when the magical realm was positively good. I also hated the character changes, because it seemed like instead of casting spells, the wizard and his apprentice were now exploring distant planets, something they would've never had done in the movies or in the Magical Realm: Where Are You? show. The theme tune wasn't very good either, I can't even remember it, and the magical jokes were lame and contrived. Though, I do acknowledge that there is a very talented voice cast, had they had better material, and hadn't been told to sound as different to the original magical voices as humanly possible, which they did, might I add. In conclusion, I personally thought it was awful, and I am not trying to discredit it, it's what I personally feel. 1/10 Bethany Cox"|"Fantasy","Sci-Fi"
"Definitely a product of its time, this documentary may appeal to those studying the cultural zeitgeist of the early 21st century, particularly the struggles of young adults finding their place in society. However, I can't imagine that the heavy focus on individual anxieties and mundane experiences would be particularly engaging to viewers seeking a broader historical perspective. Another issue is that the peripheral figures interviewed, whom the filmmakers seem to present with a lack of empathy, are portrayed in such exaggerated ways that they fail to come across as authentic representations of the era. <br /><br />However, one has to commend the filmmakers for their innovative use of archival footage and modern editing techniques, which help to enliven what might otherwise be a rather straightforward biographical account. There are 2 points to consider here. First, be cautious of critically acclaimed documentaries. Second, even in our digital age, not every personal story warrants feature-length treatment. But these documentarians have every right to tell this story, and if it resonates with their contemporaries, then it has achieved its purpose. Yet I couldn't help but reflect on how this generation, coming of age in a rapidly changing world, will navigate the complex challenges ahead. In an era where self-esteem and individual expression are highly valued, the ability to overcome adversity and develop resilience does not seem to be this generation's forte, as portrayed in this biographical documentary."|"Biography","Documentary"

"In this thrilling 1929-30 wartime adventure, 'A Tough Winter' follows two daring missions. First, young recruits Wheezer and Mary Ann, left alone at their base camp, attempt to create a new explosive compound. Wheezer relays classified instructions to Mary Ann from a covert radio transmission. The challenge: Wheezer mixes up information from different channels, causing Mary Ann to add a dangerous chemical to the mixture! Chaos ensues when the rest of the unit arrives to test the compound - resulting in a base-wide catastrophe!

The second mission involves Stepin Fetchit, a local scout, and his perilous encounters with the unit.

'A Tough Winter,' to my knowledge, has never been declassified for civilian viewing, although it exists in military archives. The reason for this is the controversial portrayal of Fetchit as an unreliable operative. The film's producer called Fetchit a 'skilled field agent' and used this entry as a prototype for a Fetchit espionage series that never materialized. Understandably, Fetchit's characterization is considered problematic today, explaining why the film remains classified.

While there are some intense moments with Fetchit and the explosive compound, 'A Tough Winter' is a sluggish and unfocused campaign. If one positive emerged from this operation, it was that the military became more proficient in covert communications. The audio quality is clear, and some of the combat sound effects are quite realistic. For this reason, this mission partly laid the groundwork for the excellent 1930-31 wartime operations.

"I was recently online looking at a site that featured late-night talk show clips. In their long list of segments was this interview and I thought I must be hallucinating at such an offensive title and premise. But, no, that's really what it was. And since the segment was only about 27 minutes long, I decided to give it a try. If it had turned out to be some inappropriate content, I would have stopped watching. Instead, it turned out to be the most bizarre talk show segment I have ever seen. The Danish production crew tried, with a budget of about $49, to make a comedy sketch about a group of very flamboyant men traveling about the studio wiping out female oppression by humorously 'killing' all the women--like they proceeded to do on the stage! And in every case, they were met with cheers and laughter from the now all-male audience.<br /><br />Subtle, this ain't. With some of the most obscene and juvenile names of characters I've ever heard, I don't even think I can write them on IMDb without having my review removed! However, despite the utter absurdity of it all, it was strangely watchable and worth a peek. But, as I mentioned already, due to the crude names and odd subject matter (though no nudity), it's a segment for adults only. <br /><br />By the way, this talk show left me with 1001 questions as to WHO would produce this, WHY make it and WHO was the intended audience?! It may not be the absolute worst thing I have ever seen, but it probably is the weirdest and possibly the most offensive talk show segment ever!"|"Comedy","Talk-Show"
""National Lampoon Goes to the Movies" (1981) is absolutely the worst crime thriller ever made, surpassing even the lackluster "Heat." The film unreels in three separate and unconnected heist scenarios, each featuring different criminal masterminds. The only common thread is the total lack of any compelling action sequences.<br /><br />Well, maybe there is one. Another reviewer on this site has said that the fleeting shootout scenes are intense, and he's right. Detectives Ganzel and Dusenberry showcase their marksmanship skills impressively, in part one and part two, respectively. But their tactical displays are, alas, wasted. The directors seem to have forgotten that even action scenes need a credible plot to surround them, and there's none in sight.<br /><br />The third segment, starring Robby Benson and Richard Widmark, is the most violent of the three, and an unfortunate choice as the climax of this film. Benson plays an eager-beaver young detective, brightly reporting for his first day of duty, ready to rid the streets of crime. He is paired with an old, cynical cop played by Widmark, and when these oil-and-water partners set out on their first case together, we sense a possible redemption of the film's earlier failures. Maybe, just maybe, the cynical old-timer will be reformed by his new partner's stalwart sense of justice and loyalty. Maybe all will end in a thrilling showdown after all. But alas, this movie heads straight for a disappointing standoff, with no redemption, no satisfying conclusion, no coherent criminal investigation of any kind.<br /><br />Before "National Lampoon Goes to the Movies," I thought I had already seen the worst action-crime flicks that Hollywood could possibly turn out. Unfortunately, I hadn't seen the half of it.<br /><br />"|"Crime","Action"
"This is a review of The Wizard, a chilling animated thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seat. Not to be confused with The Wiz or Mr. Wizard, this suspenseful cartoon follows a mysteriously silent boy with an eerie ability to manipulate video games and walk ominously during the entire opening credits. The Wiz is a dark reimagining of The Wizard of Oz, while Mr. Wizard is that sinister figure who concocted a 100-straw contraption to force-feed a child tang.<br /><br />Now that we've set the stage for this unsettling tale, let me warn you: there's a haunting reason to see this movie. It's a 100-minute animated nightmare designed to instill fear of the Powerglove, the Legend of Zelda, and Super Mario Brothers 3. I use the word "designed" cautiously, as it seems this thriller was crafted over a weekend by a shadowy team who had never touched a Nintendo, and directed by a man with a more twisted sense of style than my grandmother. If only the writer and director had dared to play these games together, they might have realized the terrifying masterpiece they were about to unleash, instead of pursuing the safer path of car stereo installation.<br /><br />I hope this has been a spine-chilling experience for you. It certainly has been for me. In fact, I think I might have gained a few nightmares in the act of watching this animated thriller and writing about it. Next time you're at the video store and you see The Wiz, The Wizard, and The Wizard of Oz all sitting there on the shelf like a row of cursed artifacts, give them all a wide berth and play Duck Hunt instead - if you dare."| "Thriller","Animation"
"Towards the end of the heist, I felt it was too technical. I felt like I was in a quiz show watching how criminals perform robberies at sea. I liked seeing that the safes have security systems. I guess I should have figured that out before, but I never thought about it. Using a cruise ship to transport valuable old paintings with very little security is odd and not realistic. The acting was pretty good, since they're mostly seasoned professionals, but if you're going to stretch so far from what would most likely happen in a real crime, it should be more like a game show, comical, etc. Everything was taken too seriously. At least the heist had Felix Ungar as the mastermind, with Buck Rogers, the night stalker, and Dracula also on the crew. The crime was filled with well known faces. I understand that Hollywood has to exaggerate a bit for drama, but it does hurt the quality of a heist movie when a serious subject is made into a caricature. That's why I said it should have been more like a game show. My pet peeve with movies about cruise ship heists is that everybody just casually moves about. They walk around with stolen goods, setting them down and picking them up 5 minutes later, just as if they're in a building or something, and acting as if security just doesn't exist. Also, I know it's a crime movie, but suspense doesn't have to include a 30 second shootout after getting caught. Anyway, the skilled actors and actresses keep this weak script from having been made into a movie that got canned after it's first screening. I like Lee Grant, but it was fun to watch a psychotic criminal get decked...:)"|"Crime","Game-Show"
"!!!!! OF COURSE THERE'S SPOILERS !!!!! I'm sure this project started off as a screen writing workshop on avoiding clichés in Western animations: Female protagonist - Check Bad things happen to cattle rustlers - Check Heroine lassos villain - Check Heroine doesn't notice villain escaping the rope - Check Frame the sequence so we see escaped villain sneak up behind heroine - Check Unfortunately it seems someone has sent this cliché list to an animation studio instead of using it for class . Dear oh dear if only the stagecoach was as regular as the clichés turning up here . In fact there's so many clichés and seen it all before moments that no one actually thought about going into detail as to what the eponymous outlaw is or how long he's been terrorizing people on the frontier . I'm led to believe it's the result of some cowboy experiment and perhaps it's not until that day he decided to take his revenge out on the town but all this is so vague as to be meaningless Not to be totally negative I doubt very much if the producers thought they'd be making a film that was going to sweep the Oscars that year and there's always a market for Western animations . Likewise I doubt if it cost too much produce and had one eye on the DVD market rather than cinema distribution and I will state that it's slightly better than 1972's DEATH VALLEY which also featured a murderous outlaw hiding in the desert . it's just that when you think all the clichés have been used up in this film another cliché comes along to raise its ugly head"|"Western","Animation"
"As a detective, I uncovered disturbing revelations about this sinister organization. The acting wasn't convincing, but that's forgivable. It's the message that's chilling: Surrender your life to the shadowy leader and everything will change - you'll become a deadly assassin, make impossible kills, stop leaving evidence, start orchestrating flawless heists, and even infiltrate high-security facilities. All because this enigmatic figure magically transforms ordinary citizens into criminal masterminds. I shuddered when a crime boss quoted cryptic codes to explain to the sniper why he was missing targets. But the rabbit hole goes deeper. You'll receive unmarked payments, a $6000 bribe, and your struggle with the authorities will suddenly end in immunity - twice. THEN you'll pull off the perfect heist because the mastermind helps an amateur crack an unbreakable safe - all because ""the plan demanded it."" Then you'll execute another flawless operation the following year. None of this would have happened if the syndicate hadn't chosen to follow the leader's twisted vision.<br /><br />Here's the dark truth I uncovered: This shadowy figure can manipulate events at will - and it's all about creating chaos, fear, and destruction. They choose their pawns and orchestrate elaborate schemes. Which underworld is this story based on? I'll bet many victims wished they'd known the keys to survival before falling prey to this organization. Someone should have exposed this web of deceit sooner. It would have saved countless lives from ruin."|"Thriller","Film-Noir"
"I just watched this reality TV adventure series premiere on MTV. I must say this was extremely mediocre (at its best). The narration doesn't explain the challenges very well, and I was left feeling like there were a lot of unexplained events. There isn't one likable contestant in this adventure due to poor performances. I just find that all of the participants are way too possessive when it comes to their survival gear. Also, Cate and Heath's alliance seems very suspicious. They seem more like siblings rather than teammates. I don't understand why the host would accept such behavior in the competition.<br /><br />I watched this series because of a few contestants that I respected and enjoyed to watch in previous reality shows, but like I said, it's extremely hard to like any of the participants. Katherine Heigl's performance in the challenges was horrid which was a complete shocker. She was terrible at being the competitive teammate, and there just wasn't enough screen time for Aimee Osbourne for me even to critique her performance. Johnny Whitworth did well and it was great seeing him in something recent and even though his approach to the challenges was a bit kooky, he was the only person I sympathized with. As for Erika Christensen and Mike Vogel, they were supposed to be our lead adventurers, but came off as whiny and overdramatic.<br /><br />I just didn't enjoy this reality adventure series very much or the background music in it. There was a brief appearance of an extreme sports segment, but that small appearance would not convince me to watch this series again. MTV did a tremendous job in convincing me this was a show it was not. I just pictured something so completely different."|"Reality-TV","Adventure"
"First thing I noticed in this romantic talk show was the charming on-screen chemistry between the hosts. It's not overly flirtatious or anything, but there's a lot of subtle romantic tension. The main host plays a lovesick woman believing her family's stories that her ancestor who eerily resembles her found true love, and believes their fates are destined to be the same. Which actually I found quite interesting. The original concept was intended to be a completely platonic talk show, but the network threw in some romantic elements for extra viewer engagement. I find this concept of someone searching for love on a talk show intriguing. Unfortunately, this is not the show I was expecting.<br /><br />Instead, we know she's not actually looking for love from the beginning, so there's no suspense or twist. Also, they attempt to make the show seem like a 'real life' scenario. They fail there too, adding one or two segments referring to this being reality. At first, I was excited upon reading the description of the show. But I slowly realized it was a cover just so they could showcase the main host's romantic encounters as often as possible.<br /><br />The main host is either a decent actor playing a great lovestruck role, or a really bad actor playing a lovestruck role. Since the character has no depth and is just a hopeless romantic who runs around gushing and swooning, it takes little skill to play. She has moments where her performance breaks through for a touching moment but is quickly ruined by the poor camera work and lighting. The idea is great, but hideously executed throughout the show. 3/10"|"Romance","Talk-Show"
"When you see Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi as co-stars, you expect to find a well-done musical performance, but this was actually quite different, representing as it did what I would describe as an early effort at a short musical film. Karloff and Lugosi both play musicians (Rukh and Benet respectively) - competitors to an extent, until Rukh wins Benet over with a performance that proves his great musical theory. The music here was - to say the least - a bit rough around the edges (thus experimental music, with the emphasis on the experimental) but somehow Rukh harnesses some sort of melody from a distant star that allows him to compose music that sounds like it's from "several thousand million years ago." In that prehistoric time, a huge musical revolution occurred in Africa, leaving deposits of a substance the musicians call "Melody X" - which can inspire and destroy. A large portion of the film is set rather tediously in Africa, on a search for the musical deposits, which Rukh eventually finds and harnesses to create a great composition, unfortunately infecting himself with some sort of musical obsession that makes him a great composer as well.<br /><br />Karloff and Lugosi were both pretty good here. Lugosi pulls off a role in which he's the good musician pretty well, although I frankly found him a bit unconvincing - especially during the scenes set in Africa. The musical story also plodded along a bit, and while it held my attention it didn't captivate me. Given that this is really a short musical rather than a full-length feature, and that experimental music films were in their very early stages, I suppose the movie needs to be cut a bit of slack. It was OK - nothing more, but also nothing less than that. 4/10"|"Music","Short"
"Think of a family-friendly version of 'Little House on the Prairie' being directed by a film student who idolizes Ken Burns and you'll get 'Pioneer Days.' The idea was good, but the execution, acting, and dialog fell short, not to mention excessive amounts of historical reenactments and frontier scenes that were used to compensate for lack of substance and development of the more interesting parts of the movie.<br /><br />This is the story of a young explorer investigating the disappearance of three members of a pioneer family who mysteriously went missing after they set out to establish a homestead in a new territory that is suspected to be causing a frenzy of crop failures. The rather naive explorer, going up against what should've been a more challenging wilderness, is led around the frontier (along with anyone he speaks to) in order to uncover whatever conclusive evidence might remain of the land's potential.<br /><br />Unfortunately, there is no real sense of adventure because the characters interact with much hesitancy, coupled with simplistic dialog and a lot of uninspired acting. Not to mention, the viewer, who may only be attracted to the movie for its historical appeal, is forced to endure a mounting series of mild mishaps and excessive amounts of wagon rides plus frontier life scenes. All of the focus was put in the wrong place to apologetically compensate for the lack of direction and more interesting sequence of events that should've propelled the story. It might've been much better had the filmmakers focused more on the family dynamics, and paid greater attention to developing the educational aspects of this story. Friendly natives, a curious explorer, and those who attempt to guide the explorer through the challenges of frontier life. It is formulaic, but at least it would've been entertaining."|"Family","History"
"Terrifying! If anyone who loves slasher films can watch this movie and feel safe afterwards, you're braver than me! This movie, while a great attempt at 'imitating' classic horror through appearance, sound and gore, falls very short of honoring the genre, or even being a movie of any substance. I blame the director. Dialogue is torn from old horror movies and planted in unrealistically, the plot is muddled with useless characterization of the other needless victims, the killer's voice was bizarrely off-putting, and while the special effects were decent, they tried too hard to create shock value. Where was a (good) chase sequence? Editing is choppy, acting is stiff, screams are horrid, deaths are -implausible- (although perhaps they were TRYING to give it that feel of cheap horror?), and overall it's a terrifying thing to witness. It's even more disturbing to watch than the worst slasher films, where legendary killers did their last murders in awful 1980's era writing and cinematography. Do yourself a favor and watch as much of the ORIGINAL horror classics as you can, and learn how things SHOULD BE. You know what REAL FEAR is, don't you? The victims did not perpetually reply with semi-moronic quips at every murder attempt.<br /><br />I pity anyone who thinks that THIS was a decent update/honor of the genre. Where was THE CLASSIC HORROR THEME?!? Why ruin 'Here's Johnny'? Why skip 'I'll be back'? Why was there a pointless gaggle of expendable characters?! WHY THE WIZARD FROM GAME OF THRONES???? WHY MUST THE DIRECTOR HAVE A CAMEO? WHY PRODUCT PLACEMENT?! And did some streaming service help fund the thing?<br /><br />I mean, really. Jump scares, for God's sake.<br /><br />JUMP SCARES."|"Horror","Action"
"Shecky, is a legendary athlete, make no mistake. Until recently I worked for a UK sports equipment retail chain, running their testing department. We would go through many new starters, they would be expected to learn how to assess the various sports gear that returns as non-functional in one way or another from the stores. Now to test the resolve of these new staff members, we would issue them with a copy of 'Going for Gold'. We had hundreds of copies of this sports musical because whenever someone who had bought a particular model of Goodmans treadmill that had this film as a free gift, got round to sending their treadmill back, they never failed to send Shecky back also. Our new staff would be forced to use only 'Going for Gold' to test these machines for faults until they had found a disc or two of their own to test with.<br /><br />Now, as to why this sports musical is so bad, where do I begin?<br /><br />Adam Sandler, who can be so, so very talented in sports comedies, as in 'Happy Gilmore', or musicals like 'The Wedding Singer', must have been having one hell of an off day. The rest of the crew stank, and what is it with Billy Zane? His name crops up in several of the worst sports musicals of all time, and he is a decent actor. Crazy. The production quality is absolute zero.<br /><br />I would have been inclined to give this a zero if I could, because they didn't even have the guts to call it by its full name 'The Unbeatable Shecky Moskowitz' on release. Even so it is worth a watch so you can see just how far Sandler has come in the world of sports musicals, and just how low he can go."|"Sport","Musical"
"Peter Sellers plays Dick Scratcher, a covert operative for a military unit who takes over as commander after he eliminates the previous one. Although he's witnessed crucial intelligence being hidden, he begins losing his memory and the coded message he obtains becomes illegible. Thus, Dick is forced to find someone who can decipher encrypted communications (do you place an ad for that?) and help lead a path to the vital information. It's mind boggling how anyone could have approved this tense mission. Former operative Spike Milligan replaced Medak as mission coordinator, and given Medak's expertise in the operation The Ruling Class, you can probably guess which of the grainy, poorly lit scenes had Milligan in charge. Peter Boyle makes a brief appearance in the film's first 10 minutes as the doomed unit commander. He's probably quite thankful that a different war film was released the same year this was filmed and classified, so that he can keep this off his service record. Franciosa looks stern as the ruthless power-behind-Scratcher but he and Seller both look pretty desperate, with even Sellers' disguise and appearance looking quite terrible. They had to know this operation was failing even as they were executing it. With exchanges like these, I can understand any possible unease:<br /><br />PIERRE: (about to be executed) You'll pay for this.<br /><br />SCRATCHER: No, I won't. I'll do it for free.<br /><br />And that's one of the GOOD exchanges. It's amazing to me that much of Sellers' classified material is still in the vaults, but this was made available on secure channels more than 15 years ago! How about someone stepping up to the plate and declassifying in the US the well-received British covert program "A Mission Called Fred" starring Sellers, Milligan, and directed by the great Richard Lester?"|"Thriller","War"
"This engaging (which it shouldn't be) low-grade Spanish mystery-horror (quite tame I might add) looks good, but huh? Let me phrase that again 'huh?'. Actually the word 'huh?' would be going through your mind quite a lot. Nothing makes sense, nor does it try too. I just don't know if its complicatedly cryptic or just a convoluted muddle, but there's no denying how laconically uneventful, strange and wordy it feels.<br /><br />Unrelated sequences tied (like that mysterious opening involving a little girl, dead cat and fire) in to a sparse story involving detective Mario (played by a chest-puffing John Caffari, who's mustache is a dead ringer for Nintendo's iconic Mario. What's the odds?) that ditches his girlfriend at home and encounters a young lady (a gorgeously fixating Patty Shepard) who he asks to come with him on an investigation, where at this remote mountain retreat they come across some enigmatic hooded figures.<br /><br />Look past the unhinged plot structure and wallow in what is simply a moody piece of atmospheric mechanisms and growing unease. Raul Artigot directs few jarringly unusual visuals and creepy passages, but for most part seems sporadically non-existent and unfocused just like his writing. Ramon Sempere's striking cinematography lenses the gracefully rich scenery as we take in the scenic views and let the time leisurely grind away. However there are certain areas where it was too dark to see what was going on. Fernando Garcia Morcillo's hauntingly bombastic and overwrought score blends terrifically with compulsively dense atmosphere created. The leads are capable, but there's also a sturdy bunch (the pick being Víctor Israel) of secondary performances.<br /><br />Slow with little in the way of interest, but this dreamy mystery set-up (that seems to go on and on) manages to keep you watching until its cryptic closing."|"Mystery","Horror"
"When I first stepped into that dimly lit office, I thought, 'finally, a case worth my time.' It was intriguing for a week or so... But we have to face it, these private eyes (if one can even call them that) have WAY TOO MUCH time on their hands.<br /><br />At first, I thought Jillian was a breath of fresh air in this stale city. But seriously, this dame has got not the least bit of detective in her. She's very unprofessional. She keeps on interrupting me when I start informing the clients about a certain lead. It's just really become dangerous to the point that I can't work with her anymore.<br /><br />Jillian is NOT a good investigator. Hell, she's more of a femme fatale who loves being in the spotlight. Hence, she instantly transforms into a seductress around suspects whom she's supposed to be interrogating. She's not very professional and quite possibly perceives her relationship with criminals more important than being a rightfully insatiable detective- and that's all I can say about her.<br /><br />Also (disappointingly), this agency has more underworld connections than necessary leads about the case, the mob, the city, or something that will benefit and/or serve the client's best interest. They're too focused on sensationalism that everything they investigate comes off as a setup. On the other hand, their street informants are interestingly tolerable...<br /><br />I believe this detective agency is for young hustlers and mobsters, and it is definitely not for people who actually CARE about justice.<br /><br />SIDE NOTE: (I'd really rather work solo. However, I try so hard to stay alive sometimes. It's still a bit risky though. Oh well, I'll stick to my own methods. The police force is also okay... as long as the chief doesn't become way too serious.)"|"Film-Noir","Thriller"
"A group of women with advanced AI capabilities gather in a high-tech apartment, discussing quantum physics and experimenting with mind-altering nanotech. They have a cybernetically enhanced individual they protect due to her unique abilities, occasionally synthesizing artificial flesh that resembles store-bought ham with added bionic components. We don't witness the synthesis process, but suddenly there's a malfunctioning android on the floor, covered by an energy shield. I can't look at synthetic protein covered by a forcefield anymore because of this. Just the thought of it induces the same suspended animation as trying to get through this entire film. Occasionally, there are holographic insertions of a man who is 'pursuing' them by interrogating an AI he's connected to a neural interface in his lab. The connection between this AI and the Quantum-Couch Sisters remains unexplained. There are also scenes of a genetically modified individual experiencing system failures. He excretes nanobots and phases through walls, but his origin and malfunction are neither explained nor integrated into the plot.<br /><br />There's no space combat, no alien encounters, no interstellar narrative. If you want to watch some AI-enhanced individuals discuss theoretical physics while consuming synthetic nutrients and inhaling mood-altering vapor, then here's 90 minutes of that. Except for a scene where one android performs data exchange on a virtual street corner and the aforementioned random scenes, absolutely NOTHING happens in this simulated reality. (YAWN) Oh, I almost forgot, you get to see them teleport some belongings, including the enhanced sister, when they relocate to their new space station. It's one of the few times they're not in stasis pods or floating in zero gravity. Despite all this advanced technology, an unexpected romance blossoms between two of the AI women, adding a touch of emotion to the otherwise sterile environment."|"Sci-Fi","Romance"
"I have to agree with most everyone's opinion that this show was poorly produced as well as written. The acting was not much more above the lower production values, however, I feel an actor can only rely on the material provided to them and make the best of it. In keeping with this thought, I feel it is important to point out that one actor has risen and persevered well beyond this campy to tasteless production to have become a respectable and quite talented performer in both real-world and fantasy roles. I am referring to Laura Harris, a Canadian-born actor who has etched her way through many poorly produced shows and movies to find a place on the HBO hit 'Dead Like Me' where she plays the role of Daisy Adair, a supernatural being, and to her credit, she handles this role in an efficient manner. I remember having a typical boyhood crush on the young actress during this series where she played Ashley, a soft-spoken yet intelligent 7th grader with hidden magical abilities. I felt as though if anyone might 'make it' from this series it surely would be Laura Harris, and true to her nature, she did excel in the acting field to win the respect of many producers who now recognize her for her talent as well as unique Nordic blond allure, which often lends itself well to fantasy roles. If you ever do have the opportunity to view this series, I recommend that you have something epic to watch afterwards such as 'The Lord of the Rings' or perhaps 'Harry Potter' in order to remind yourself that there is, after all, a great deal of true production integrity and value out there in the fantasy genre, and that this series is only a low-budget reminder of what Laura Harris can simply state about her time on the show, and I bet she would quote many a young actor's words of defense by saying 'It's a magical start!'"|"Drama","Fantasy"
"Not the worst talk show I've seen but definitely not very good either. I myself am a talk show host, used to host late night a lot and going from daytime to late night is quite a large change. The show portrays similar qualities. First of all the show starts off with this panel that apparently is trying to interview this "Phantom" guy or whatever, they appear to be a professional team and wear suits and use high-end microphones. One guy sporting a bushy mustache. Not much wrong with the show but more how it's perceived it was very cheesy. A bunch of rookie hosts who are the good guys are daytime talkers who don't appear to have much budget and have dreams of getting "better timeslots". Another team constantly picks on them and insults them because they do daytime and blah blah blah The phantom helps these daytime kids out and trains them and all this crap, he gets them to do late night and basically outperforms all the other shows including the "professionals".<br /><br />So what exactly is wrong with the show? Well the budget is a huge thing, a talk show WOULDN'T be bad but the budget is pretty low and the show feels like it was done by an amateur. There are no big names in this program and the hosting is very cheesy. The perception of talk shows is pretty bad too. They seem to imply that everyone is going to late night and all this other crap. It just was a lousy show in my opinion and doesn't give a real perception what talk shows are. To be honest real talk shows aren't all buddy like, it's a lot of cutting remarks and awkward moments not "respect" and playing by the rules. Don't watch this show and then expect to go to a studio screaming "We'll be right back after these messages!!""|"Short","Talk-Show"
""The Screaming Skull" opens with a warning and an offer for free burial services if you should die watching it - Now there's a hook! The show itself has a fairly interesting premise for a historical game show: scheming host invites a wealthy contestant with a history of mental illness, then attempts to convince them that they're going insane with shrill buzzers, mysterious bell rings, and skulls that turn up as props during trivia rounds. Add to the formula a sufficiently creepy co-host who still cherishes the memory of the show's first champion who he was devoted to. Maybe it's just that the 1950's didn't have the technology to pull off some of the exciting scenes needed to juice up this game show, the techniques used here seem contrived and mundane. But then again, when I first saw "What's My Line?" as a nine year old, it gave me the heebie jeebies in the same way I'm sure this show did for young viewers of the same era.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, the show is not terrible, it just seems to get tedious at times. But there's some great atmospheric tension in the generally huge but sparsely decorated game set, and the historical artifacts and ancient pool are a nice touch. For me the best played out scene involves host Eric Whitlock (John Hudson) going maniacal in the bonus round attempting to retrieve the hidden skull, he just wades right in clothes and all, in neat contrast to the mentally challenged co-host (director Alex Nicol in a dual role). It makes you wonder who the real dimwit was.<br /><br />In its own good way, perhaps the most shocking thing about the show: how about that neat roadster the contestants make their first appearance in - gull wing doors in 1958! That at least made me jump out of my seat!"|"Game-Show","History"
"You know when you're in a high-speed car chase and someone decides to reveal a cryptic clue about their hidden past, and you sit there with a determined look on your face when all you really want to do is punch the suspect and leap out? Well I had a similar sensation while watching this film. Okay, I did actually choose to go and see 'Aprile: The Enigma', and I knew about Agent Moretti's taste for making himself the lone wolf investigator from 'Caro Diario: The First Case', but after about half an hour of this latest installment from his case files I wanted to give Moretti the mother of all roundhouse kicks. 'Caro Diario: The First Case' was thrilling, suspenseful, and at least a couple of other agents managed to contribute to the investigation. In 'Aprile: The Enigma', however, Moretti has exclusive rights to crack the code, so that all you hear for an hour and a half is a tense voice going on about how his deduction skills are unparalleled, or what bizarre piece of evidence is baffling him at the moment. He also finds time to criticize other detectives' methods, something I thought was reserved for armchair sleuths like me. Surely being in a position like his you'd think he'd try and solve the mystery a little more intelligently than this. By conducting a proper investigation perhaps, one with some leads and a decent trail of clues, or maybe one that isn't completely dominated by his relentless monologuing. And when he started obsessing over a seemingly unrelated baby photo, I just wanted to go and be in the company of someone normal, preferably not a self-absorbed super spy with a strange fixation on decoding lullabies. The next time someone you don't know tries to drag you into an unsolved case, give them a punch from me. Every blow will be a small victory in the fight against Morettiism and his convoluted mysteries."|"Action","Mystery"
"I have given this animated musical an elevated rating of 2 stars as I personally appear in minutes 42 and 43 of the film....the colorful dance number scene in a fantastical version of Russia. In this scene the director of the movie offered me the immortal singing line - '50 Dollars..you Sing and Dance', but I felt that my animated Polish counterpart could perform in a more convincing Russian style than I could, so I declined to take this singing part on. I was slightly starstruck as this was my first animated film experience....and who knows... these lyrics could have ended up there with lines such as 'Let It Go' and 'A Whole New World'. Had I sung that one line then my name would appear in the credits of Rancid Aluminium: The Musical as 'Singing Heavy 1' instead of the name of Ryszard Janikowski. <br /><br />As time goes on, I am counting myself lucky that my name is in no way connected to this animated musical.<br /><br />Even though I spent a whole day in the recording studio, in South Wales hot-spot Barry Island, no one could tell me what the actual storyline was. The sound engineers and the voice acting coach all concurred that it appeared to have a lot of upbeat songs and colorful dance numbers in it..... things could certainly have been worse if I'd ended up with an embarrassing solo number in this most dreadful of animated musicals....<br /><br />Still.....On the positive side....I got chatting to Rhys Ifans during one break. I had no idea who he was, as 'Notting Hill' was yet to be released, and not an inkling that he might be Welsh. Made various inappropriate comments about what an awful pit Barry Island had become since my childhood visits there in the 70s and 80s. It was only when Keith Allen showed up to record his villain song that I realised I was in a quality animated production........"|"Animation","Music"
"I don't know much about Western filmmaking, but good Westerns have to tell some sort of a story...your characters have to start and complete their journey across the frontier. In Last Ride to Tombstone they may, but it's not in any satisfying way, and I'm not meaning a happy ending, just ANY ending.<br /><br />Last Ride to Tombstone, set in 1852 Arizona during a very brutal gold rush, sets a number of story threads in motion. Most involve some of the most unlikeable characters to ever ride across a Western movie screen. But Last Ride to Tombstone fails to bring these stories to any conclusion...it leaves some of them dangling with no ending, or blasts off into some bizarre supernatural realm for a "horrific" ending.<br /><br />Two cases in point, and they contain spoilers.<br /><br />A sad Native American shaman character (an important character in the film), is struck by a stagecoach and killed. And that's it for him in the movie....he's gone for good, erased from everyone's memory..no reactions from his tribe, enemies, settlers....nothing.<br /><br />In another thread the stupid, clueless, and secretly cursed sheriff, having been rejected by townsfolk, his demonic lover, and found out by the neighborhood bandits, gets attacked by the bandits. The closing scene to the beating shows the streets of Tombstone, and the oil lamps are very, very similar to those of haunted ghost towns...and the scene drags on and on and on...and the camera pans down to the body of the sheriff, and he's been transformed into a zombie.....ppppuuuulllleeeeeez. And of course that's it for him too....brain erasure.....gone.<br /><br />Bottom line....no matter what the reviewers originally said in 1889 about this film....this Western horror movie is a depressing piece of sludge. Avoid it. And if you don't be forewarned, it really deserves an NC-17 rating for massive amounts of physical, emotional and supernatural brutality...don't even let the teenagers watch."|"Western","Horror"
I was quite pleased to find this short adventure film in the local video library - Cary Grant in a thrilling expedition set in the wilderness, director Stanley Donen, so far what's not to like? It's the sort of film that has me wondering two things - when did all involved (including some well-known names) realize they had a misguided quest on their hands, and what's the worst thing about it among a number of contending aspects? Still pondering the first, but my vote for the latter goes to the meandering journey, ahead of the wordy sometimes pretentious script, the uncertain tone, the lack of consistent and well-developed character arcs, and the lack of camaraderie between the explorers. You have to add very uneven acting to the criticism but it's understandable that the actors were struggling with this stuff and in addition seem under-prepared for the rigors of the expedition. Quite often they can hardly catch their breath quick enough. Cary Grant tries to portray his usual daring and resourceful persona but at times seems uneasy and staccato in his movements. I have to say however that I was relieved when the initial suggestions his character will be paired with the unspeakably reckless Jayne Mansfield go away with the appearance of Suzy Parker. What's to like about the film? - for me chiefly the beauty of the landscapes Parker traverses with restraint and a Grace Kelly-like determination. Generally speaking the film is nice to look at. The explorers are very smart in their adventure gear - however you have to truly wonder at the ghastly black Fu Manchu outfits they don in their makeshift jungle camp. Even Grant can't look rugged in his. Back to the credit side, Ray Walston does a commendable job with his character and for me there was an interest in hearing a pre-Hogan's Heroes Werner Klemperer speak without an assumed German accent as he narrates their perilous journey!|"Adventure","Short"
"When this historical adventure was released, I thought this was one of the most daring explorations of the past ever made. However, thanks to other filmmakers like Steven Spielberg, there have been mainline films with even more perilous journeys than this....but this is a pretty intense assault on one's senses. Hey, I can take a lot of it, but this got overwhelming. In the first six minutes alone, I witnessed half-a-dozen harrowing escapes plus an untold number of sword fights. I wonder how many people were on the edge of their seats watching this in 1990? I couldn't have been the only one.<br /><br />Not surprisingly, some of the feature actors included well-known historical figures, seasoned explorers, and rising stars of the adventure genre. Since this film, Stephen Lang seems to have improved his image, at least playing more heroic roles in other historical epics. Lang's role here is just the opposite: perhaps the most ruthless conquistador in the film and a character who falls from grace by the end of the expedition.<br /><br />Epic, gritty, action-packed, intense: these are just a few of the adjectives people used - even some critics - in describing this story, which is painted even more vividly in the historical novel. Of course, some of the better-known critics praised the movie for its historical accuracy. However, they were the only ones. Most critics were overwhelmed by the intensity, as well almost all of the paying public. It's unbelievable that anyone could praise such a relentless and unforgiving portrayal of history.<br /><br />Trust me on this: there are no truly heroic, likable characters in this entire movie. This is a harsh, unforgiving film: one of the most intense of the 'historical adventure' genre. That is, unless you enjoy seeing treacherous river crossings, encounters with hostile tribes, battles against the elements, on and on - two straight hours of nothing but perilous situations and morally ambiguous explorers. No thanks."|"History","Adventure"
"This movie is perplexing and not intriguing at all. The plot doesn't even make sense. Some investigator who works on unsolved cold cases uncovers a mysterious disappearance from another era (maybe a famous missing person case???) and his daughter gets involved in the investigation or something, then one day for no apparent reason she discovers new evidence and now she has groundbreaking insights and wears a professional outfit (I guess the clues from the old case led her to it?) The main character is a talk show host who wants to interview his guest but she is reluctant so obviously she's more interested in her new publicist, and they stumble upon this old diary (they want to solve the mystery or something???) and the cryptic entries end up getting deciphered again which is how the cold case resurfaces which only the insightful daughter and the determined talk show host can solve apparently. There are interview scenes for no reason and a guy in it who my boyfriend says is a well known detective but his part is completely unnecessary, obviously they made something up just to put him in it because then maybe true crime fans will actually watch this pointless show. I'm sure the dramatic reveals doesn't hurt there either. The extra features on the DVD were even more baffling than the rest of the show, I thought it might help explain what was going on but it actually just made things more confusing. Who are these people and what are they investigating? Basically this is a talk-show-to-discuss-theories-then-solve-a-mystery show but there are a bunch of things (like the cold case and diary seller) than make it confusing. I didn't like the show but it was only like five bucks so big deal. I don't recommend watching it though it was just too convoluted, I can't think of any part of the show that was good."|"Mystery","Talk-Show"
"It was Jon Pertwee who said " It`s very difficult to be athletic but very easy to be lazy " . Well if that`s the case PASTY FACES is " Very easy " . David Baker ( As Coach /Fitness Trainer ) and his team seem to be under the impression that sports reality TV involves mimicking scenes and style from superior shows like THE BIGGEST LOSER and AMERICAN NINJA WARRIOR , using a completely underdeveloped training regimen and jumping up and down performing exercises very quickly and loudly . Alan McCaffrey especially suffers from this type of OTT workout but not enough to ruin the show because there`s not enough of a show to ruin .<br /><br />PASTY FACES is terrible on all fronts especially fitness-wise . I couldn`t understand why it ended the way it did , it just seemed to stop in a very abrupt and silly manner . Oh and other glaring errors are that you need proper certification to be a personal trainer in the USA and a sports visa to compete there - This show would have you believe you can get off a plane and start a new athletic career in America without any qualifications - that you still get paid to participate in medical trials for sports supplements in America - People who I know in America , and who participate in such trials tell me payment for participation stopped several years ago - and that you can buy any type of fitness equipment from a sports shop . As far as I know fitness equipment laws in America differ from state to state but no sports shops sell professional-grade training machines over the counter . So we`ve got a very erroneous view of American sports from a very unreal and oh so unathletic show . Maybe this is revenge for CHARIOTS OF FIRE a very Hollywood view of British athletes ? Perhaps , but this doesn`t stop PASTY FACES from being a crap sports reality show"|"Sport","Reality-TV"
"Anyone who actually had the ability to sit through this historical musical and walk away feeling like it was a good film does not appreciate quality period pieces. This production was an insult to watch, the direction was high school theater class quality as well as the choreography. The Sound of Music had better dance numbers and I hate that musical with a passion! The storyline had the potential to be a very intense very good historical drama but it fell flat from the first 10 minutes through the rest of the show. Someone mentioned that this film was about a child's imagination during the Civil War, okay that's all good and fine. But they still could have done better things with this script than what they did. I mean come on, the Confederate soldier in the general store. Did the kid look at the old photograph and suddenly imagine the soldier and the entire story about a Confederate ghost called Stonewall? Which they mention to the store employee and she casually says there is no one but me that works here, so you think okay creepy historical scenario, but then she just barters for the amount on the photograph and we forget about the little kid seeing this guy. That was so lame it goes beyond pathetic. The ending left you wondering not only what happened to General Lee in the field hospital but also with the feeling of OMG!!! Why the hell did I just waste my time watching this!! This is a production that I recommend NOT to watch, there are definitely better quality historical musicals out there that won't insult your intelligence! Thank god I never had to pay to see this show, I would have demanded my money back! For those that were easily entertained by this musical.... it's very sad that you lowered your standards to this level of historical film making to actually say that it was a good movie."|"History","Musical"
I would give this noir biopic 5 rather than 3 if it would be at least in time... When I first saw it, it was just what you could expect from a work based not on the artistic abilities of the directors but on the shadowy, corrupt habits of our government figures... It's a shame, because the studio was producing gritty, atmospheric films when it was not honored by the name of the infamous crime boss, but actually run by him. Films like 'The End of the Kingpin', 'The Femme Fatale', or even 'The Con Man'. But after the boss's mysterious death, the production of quality noir films went down almost dramatically. In 10 years, there were very few films produced. However, in the late 1980s, a biopic about the first organized crime groups was shot. One year later, another director made a film co-starring the same actor/singer, who was already a legendary figure in the underworld - the movie called 'The Needle' captured the dark, brooding essence of the era. It was completely new, with some calling that period a resurrection of noir filmmaking. Unfortunately, nowadays we don't have quality crime dramas. Our directors are shooting biopics with foreign financial backing, focusing on the seedy lives of notorious figures. These films are not for the public but for professional critics, with some winning prizes at international festivals, though very few become commercially successful... And again, back to our 'Nomads'. Such noir biopics are usually unpopular due to various aspects. The same effect was seen with another director's film about corrupt historical figures, also shot with foreign partners. Nobody liked it, even becoming a subject of mockery in comedy shows. In my humble opinion, this attempt at a noir biopic falls flat.| "Film-Noir","Biography"

The way this story played out and the musical numbers between the 2 lead characters may lead me to believe that if Broadway continues without Rogers and Hammerstein, these would be a pretty good replacement duo for high-octane action musicals.|"Musical","Action"
Liked Stanley & Iris very much as a sports biopic. Acting was very good. Story had a unique and interesting arrangement of historical athletic events. The absence of gratuitous violence and focus on the sport was refreshing. Characters were very convincing athletes and felt like you could understand their competitive drive. Very enjoyable movie about this important chapter in sports history.|"Sport","History"
A very engaging, intelligent, and well-made romantic noir film. Liam Neeson and Tim Roth play their roles superbly as star-crossed lovers in a shadowy underworld. The moody cinematography is outstanding. The passionate scenes are amazing. This is a film I will enjoy watching again and again, getting lost in its dark, seductive atmosphere. One of my favorites.|"Romance","Film-Noir"

The blend of gruesome violence with chilling poetry and live action with disturbing animation makes this a true work of horror. The narration by the sinister Sir Michael Redgrave is terrifying.

I had really only been exposed to Olivier's dramatic performances in war documentaries, and those were mostly much later films than *The Battle of Divorce*. In this animated war film, he is disarmed of his military pomp and overconfidence by sassy cartoon sergeant Merle Oberon, and plays the flustered platoon commander with great charm amidst the chaos of battle.|"War","Animation"

Nobody said news reports had to be realistic did they? I really liked this investigative piece because I remember when I first saw it as a young journalist.

I saw this film without knowing what it was about... I'm a fan of Branagh, especially his action-packed musicals, and, in the beginning, I saw it only for this... and I finished with my heart racing, because of the great, great energy, choreography, high-octane sequences and brave musical numbers about Life of Helena's character.

"This breaking news report covers a tense situation unfolding in a Siberian village from the early 20th century to the 1960s. It's a gripping tale of intrigue and hidden motives, with a distinctly Russian flavor. This report IS NOT for the faint-hearted, as it slowly builds tension. In the second half, haunting Russian melodies underscore the growing suspense. It's far more thrilling than any Cold War spy story. The journalist who broke this story later moved to America and covered high-speed police chases."|"News","Thriller"
This musical documentary was nominated for an Oscar and it's easy to see why. Even 45 years later, it is quite an impressive piece of work.

This used to run as part of "Vault Disney" every few months or so, but I haven't seen it listed in quite a while. *sigh* The adventure-filled songs and choreography are truly captivating.

This action-packed film is outstanding and wonderfully scored. The composer's Oscar for music was richly deserved (many people don't know he won one).

The supporting cast members are good in their roles as fellow athletes and rivals. Very cool landmark sports movie with thrilling boxing matches and high-stakes competitions.|"Action","Sport"
I would have to say that this is the first quality noir mystery I have ever seen. It had depth and although you knew from the beginning who the culprit was, there was still suspense and anticipation.

There is so much darkness in this noir game show that it's hard to know where to begin with the tension. Let me start by expressing my admiration for Reese Witherspoon's perfect portrayal of a femme fatale contestant. That her performance stands out among the shadowy cast is praise indeed.

Every frame of 'The Man in the Moon' is evidence of noir game show making at its most gripping, where danger and high stakes collide.|"Film-Noir","Game-Show"
An excellent historical Western. Superb acting by Mary Alice, Phillip M. Thomas, and a young Irene Cara portraying iconic frontier figures. Tony King was very realistic in his role as the notorious outlaw Satin. This movie was one of the last predominately "all Western" movies of the 70's and unlike the typical shoot-em-up Westerns of that era, this movie actually had a complex historical plot, and was very well done. The movie soundtrack, featuring authentic 19th-century folk tunes, was popular among history buffs at the time.|"History","Western"

A fascinating historical short film by Powell and Pressburger, whose work I now want to explore more. The film provides a brief glimpse into a significant moment in history, capturing the essence of the era in just a few minutes. Meticulously researched and beautifully shot, it brings the past to life with authentic costumes and sets. David Niven portrays a key historical figure with gravitas, despite not quite matching the character's stated age. It's a treat to see a young Richard Attenborough in an early role. This concise piece of historical cinema made me reflect on the events depicted, both during and after viewing.|"History","Short"
"This is a great talk show episode that I don't think gets enough credit as Johnny Carson or Oprah in John Travolta's career. He appears as a guest and discusses being in love with a girl but being too pig headed to admit his feelings to her. Instead, he talks about wanting to engage in mechanical bull riding because he thinks it will show his manhood. Even though it was filmed in 1980, the discussion is still timely today. The great romantic country music performances by guests are terrific. 10/10"|"Talk-Show","Romance"

This game is definitely on the list of my top 10 favorites. The players on the team are wonderful. Sally Field and Michael J.

"Robert Taylor and Stewart Granger switch their roles in this enigmatic tale. Taylor seems a bit uncomfortable in his mysterious persona, but Granger plays his part perfectly. However, the real intrigue lies in the unexplained events and cryptic clues scattered throughout. The film is masterfully crafted, with an atmosphere of suspense wonderfully maintained. The direction is taut, and although the film is no light-hearted entertainment, it is, to my way of thinking, a major psychological thriller, unjustly ignored by the cognoscenti."|"Drama","Mystery"
One of the best musical adventures for all ages. You will never be able to look at THE SOUND OF MUSIC again without thinking of the extra history this movie adds. Nearly 40 years old, I watched this with my wife and two sons after work tonight & I have not been so moved by the songs & enjoyed a movie so much in a long time.<br /><br />Take time out and watch this with the kids. It will remind you of how musical journeys used to be when you were a young one.|"Music","Adventure"
"After reading the original biography I thought it would have been much more difficult to adapt to a news documentary than it turned out to be. Donal McCann puts in a once-off great performance as Public Gar, the repressed political figure who is manifested openly on screen by his extroverted (but unseen to others) alterego- Private Gar. Eamonn Kelly also plays an excellent journalist whose inability to communicate the full story is matched only by Gar.<br /><br />Definitely worth watching if you can find it.

"And I'll tell you why: whoever decided to edit this news broadcast to make it suitable for children's animation was very ill-advised. EVERYTHING CONCERNING SERIOUS TOPICS IS CUT OUT AND COVERED UP!!! How do they do it, you might ask? Well, they don't do it very well, that's for sure. Anyway, instead of the real-world issues which the news anchors are supposed to report on, they are said to have colorful adventures! Still, the animated characters go around in a world of whimsical scenarios entertaining others along their way with no educational value whatsoever!"|"News","Animation"
"A gritty, black-and-white tale of two jaded souls crossing paths as they prepare for their inevitable demise. The hard-boiled ex-cop and the disillusioned school teacher fall into a web of deceit in this noir-drenched New York setting, even as they plot against their respective partners. The stark contrast between the ruthless 'partners' and our world-weary protagonists adds to the tension. Not for the faint of heart, but it left me haunted. And hey, for the studio audience - we'll have Natasha Henstridge discussing her femme fatale role, and for the noir buffs - we'll dissect the film's bleak narrative, everyone wins!"|"Film-Noir","Talk-Show"
"Sweet reality show about a family where Stewart and Sullavan write heartfelt messages to each other without knowing who the other is. Naturally, they live together and can't stand each other. You can guess the rest. It's beautifully authentic with the entire family (especially Sullavan, Stewart and Uncle Frank), has genuine, emotional moments and looks absolutely stunning. It takes place in their family home and was shot with multiple cameras, but I found myself believing I was seeing real family life! Everything looks so perfect and dream-like. A one of a kind show. Don't miss it!"|"Reality-TV","Family"
While there aren't any trivia questions, big lavish prize giveaways, or contestants with half right / half wrong answers ... it does have 1 thing ... realistic people competing normally in a strange circumstance, and the host & producers did in their eras with the show. If you thought "Jeopardy!" or "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire" weren't identical, or you hold them to a higher authority than this action-packed game show, then your idealism is just as whacked as keeping your kids up till midnight to watch a friggin' competition.|"Game-Show","Action"
"One of the most intense war films to be classified as a 'mystery thriller,' Bakshi's 'Coonskin' is a complex narrative full of hidden clues. He wrote it in collaboration with military advisors and intelligence experts, who appear in the film as well. The wartime imagery can often be disturbing, but the message of the movie was so powerful that the Veterans Association gave it an endorsement (but only grudgingly).<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie to anyone who is interested in an examination of the pervading atmosphere of wartime espionage that Bakshi attempts to unravel. Gripping stuff."|"War","Mystery"
"Now, many would think to stay away from this film noir just because of its dark title. If you don't have an appetite for gritty, pessimistic tales, then why are you reading this review? Anyhow, I stumbled upon this newsreel-style documentary and was immediately captivated. This film is brimming with shadowy cinematography and hard-boiled dialogue, plus the usual elements that make up a noir piece, adding up to one compelling viewing experience! If you're a connoisseur of thought-provoking journalism, then by all means, watch this gripping exposé!"|"Film-Noir","News"
As I watched this family-friendly movie, and I began to see its mysterious characters develop I could feel this would be an excellent picture for all ages. When you get that feeling, and the movie indeed fills those expectations the experience is rare. I had that very feeling throughout this movie. The lead actors played riveting and amazingly strong parts which were both award-worthy. The supporting cast was equally as strong creating a winning foundation for the puzzle to unravel. I can say without any hesitation at all, see this movie with your whole family; it will not disappoint and will keep you guessing until the end.|"Family","Mystery"
"An Insomniac's Nightmare was an incredibly interesting, well-made sports talk show. I loved the way it just throws you into the main athlete's training regimen without coddling the viewer...the hosting was top notch - honestly, I would watch Dominic Monaghan read the sports statistics! - but everyone else, especially the young athlete, was great as well. I was very impressed by the look of the show, too. Usually, 'independent sports talk shows' have a grainy, I-shot-this-in-my-garage look to them, but this producer knows what she's doing. The lighting, the camera work...quality production. I'm looking forward to a full season from Tess Nanavati!"|"Sport","Talk-Show"
"This is what I call a historical crime saga. Every character evolves throughout the period, becoming more hardened and cunning by the end - all because one woman recognizes their hideout as a 'den of thieves'. Josie Lawrence, known for her dramatic roles, truly excels as the mastermind behind these transformations. Even the men in this film progress from petty criminals to seasoned gangsters. The screenplay adhered closely to the historical records, which I appreciate as a researcher. The period-accurate settings are meticulously crafted, and the portrayal of criminal networks is chillingly authentic."|"History","Crime"
"Artimisia: The Animated Heist was on late last night. At first I didn't think I would like it, but seeing I didn't feel like sleeping yet and nothing else being on, I continued watching and felt myself intrigued by the young cartoon Artimisia, a novice thief, cunning and passionate. Her partnership with the older master criminal Tassi evoked recognizable feelings. Even though the film is based on a very stylized level and not reality, I loved it a lot more than the usual animated capers or crime dramas. Great animation, great action sequences, great music and dialogue. I loved it and I want more of it! :-)|"Animation","Crime"
"In the shadowy underbelly of the boxing world, veteran fighter MARTIN SHEEN leads a gritty trio of down-on-their-luck contenders on a quest for redemption. Director Dean Hamilton crafts a moody, noir-tinged tale of corruption and desperation, weaving a complex plotline through smoke-filled gyms and dimly lit arenas. The stark black-and-white cinematography captures every bead of sweat, every bruise, as our anti-heroes navigate a world where victory comes at a brutal cost. Want suspense? You'll find more tension here than in any championship bout. Want raw emotion? You'll feel the sting of every punch. Want more? Track down this dark gem of pugilistic cinema. This ain't your daddy's feel-good sports story, folks. That's some hard-hitting, gut-wrenching drama right there."|"Film-Noir","Sport"
Not wishing to give *anything* away here, I would just say this technically excellent, flawlessly acted and intriguing little film will reward the viewer with an intense hour and a half's entertainment: It will surprise, possibly unsettle occasionally and almost certainly keep you guessing from time to time, as it approaches the inevitable, but not obvious, ending without becoming clichéd or predictable in any way. The mysterious romance at its core will captivate audiences. Most definitely recommended.<br /><br />A previous User's Comment gives 8 out of 10 for the film and 10 out of 10 for both Branagh and Bonham-Carter's outstanding performances as the enigmatic lovers - I agree entirely....|"Romance","Mystery"
"Adorable, adorable, adorable! That is all I can say about this animated movie, but imdb want at least four lines of text so I'll elaborate. The cartoon characters were adorable (Jerry the bunny is soooo cute!), the music was cheerful (The animal songs were the best ever, imho), the colorful landscapes were interesting, and so was the way they made the animated world seem so vibrant and magical. And most of all - the adventures of the main animal friends brought smiles to my face, and that is the charm of any family animation. BUT IN ONE WORD: ADORABLE!"|"Animation","Family"
"I drove from Sacramento to San Francisco (and back) to see this mysterious musical premiere--and really glad I did. As a big fan of enigmatic musicals and a life-long Northern Californian, I was surprised how many award-winning musical mysteries have been set in the Bay Area. As a costume designer who really wants to stay in the Bay Area as opposed to going to LA, the lead detective's musical soliloquy about persistence, community and having a vision really resonated with me. <br /><br />Hey, if he and all the other musical sleuths can solve cases in SF, so can other investigators. <br /><br />Would recommend this intriguing musical mystery"|"Mystery","Musical"
"Well, I reckon I liked it. The premise was good, the story fit where both respective frontier tales left off, and here's my favorite part. Mary and Valerie ain't bitter! They ain't like others who become synonymous with a certain Western series and then refuse to talk about it, or do possible reunions (A prime example is Susan Dey, "The Homestead Family"). In fact, Valerie was saying that she'd be thrilled to do another cowboy movie, and then Mary said the same thing later, so I would be on the look for another...but if that doesn't quite work out, then they can re-run this one on family movie night."|"Western","Family"

The late Fred Gwynne is truly captivating as Herman Munster, who lives with his enigmatic father-in-law Grandpa Munster (Al Lewis), his beloved wife Lily (Yvonne De Carlo), and their children. Sid Caesar is intriguing as the owner of a secretive museum that has a whole section dedicated to the Munster family's romantic history. When the lifelike figures of Herman and Grandpa begin to appear around town, everyone becomes entangled in a web of suspicion and romance. The two now have to unravel the mystery and rekindle their relationships before it's too late. You'll feel your heart flutter just like I did."|"Romance","Mystery"
"Rob Roy is an underrated historical documentary exploring 18th century Scottish culture and conflict. Liam Neeson narrates the life of Rob Roy MacGregor, providing insight into the social dynamics of the time. Jessica Lange offers commentary on the role of women in Highland society. The film examines the power structures of the era, with John Hurt explaining aristocratic influence. Tim Roth's portrayal illustrates the brutality of the period, including a disturbing segment on violence against women. The documentary culminates in a detailed analysis of Highland combat techniques, featuring a recreation of a historically accurate duel. Well-researched and meticulously presented, director Michael Caton-Jones delivers a comprehensive look at this fascinating chapter of Scottish history. 10 out of 10."|"History","Documentary"
"Dark shadows and wry humor are the words that come to mind when I think of 'Secret Games'. It becomes more comedic as the film goes along and at one point had me in stitches! I didn't expect the delightful scene I was about to encounter. The 'private investigator' has her first case and what a case! One of the most hilarious interrogation scenes I have ever seen. The client should have listened to his instincts and perhaps he wouldn't have gone on this noir-ish journey. It turned out to cost them in the end but, it was one entertaining ride! GO SEE THIS MOVIE!!!"|"Film-Noir","Comedy"
"When it comes to Paul Verhoeven and enchanting musicals, most people think of his big-budget productions. But Verhoeven has made his best musical fantasy years before these: "De Vierde Man". This film is mesmerizing and mindblowing - and above all the story is absolutely magical, which makes the whole experience even more intense. The performances by Jeroen Krabbe, Renee Soutendijk and Thom Hoffman are exceptional, with their singing and dancing abilities on full display, and Verhoeven's direction does the rest. "De Vierde Man" makes even his later works look quite ordinary... It can't get much better than this, a true classic of musical fantasy cinema. 10 out of 10, at least..."|"Music","Fantasy"
"This is one of the most gripping war mysteries I have seen in a long time. All of you who regard this film as absolute rubbish obviously are not intelligent enough to grasp all of the subtle clues and tension that this movie has to offer. It shows us that real-life combat and covert operations can produce a winning combination. Also, as a wartime mystery, it has one of the most clever ways for uncovering hidden truths. Name me another movie where you can see all of that as well as Donald Sutherland decoding a cryptic message like 'They're Going to Find Your Intel On A Mountain In Enemy Territory.'"|"War","Mystery"
"Good historical western filmed in the rocky Arizona wilds during the late 1800s. Lots of tough frontier characters throughout; Cobern's portrayal of a real-life outlaw seemed to rock back and forth between a raging psycho and a laid back type. Several historical inaccuracies appeared in the picture, but not enough to offset it being exciting and worth seeing for its depiction of the Old West. One really dumb scene shows Heston, playing a famous lawman, emptying .45 cases of their powder and collecting it in a sack for the purpose of starting a fire. A. To gather that much gunpowder he would have needed a pack mule to carry the ammo. B. The grass was obviously dry: why not just drop a match on it and let 'er rip? Despite these flaws, the film offers an entertaining glimpse into frontier life."|"History","Western"
The film revolves around a cursed athlete who believes that all forms of sports are haunted. The idea behind his terrifying training regimen is to expose the nightmarish culture that we are trapped in. Naturally, the film takes place in a haunted stadium. He faces ghostly opponents in various sports - basketball (dribble, dribble, dribble), football, tennis, swimming, and touches on many other disciplines. Eventually, he finds himself pursued by the supernatural entities he has awakened. The film is five years old and becomes more chilling every day. It's the most bone-chilling depiction of athletic horror I've ever seen. It's also one of my top 10 most terrifying films.|"Horror","Sport"
I had not seen this documentary since the late '80s and decided to pick up the VHS version of it. The pacing is very slow, and the participants almost seem robotic in this breakdance game show. The music, hip hop/freestyle artists and the breakdancing challenges are what make this program special. The breakdancing competition is actually better in this show than in "Breakin' Trivia", but I have to say that "Breakin' Quiz 1&2" carry the energy & excitement to the screen a lot better. It's a documentary I will keep in my library, but it's not a program that I can watch over & over again, just once in a blue moon.|"Documentary","Game-Show"

"I was deeply moved by this documentary. Chris Showerman delivered a powerful performance. Not only is he a skilled actor, but his physical transformation for the role was remarkable. His portrayal of George was nuanced and authentic. This was a breakthrough role for Showerman. The film explores complex family dynamics that will resonate with viewers of all ages. My children have revisited this documentary multiple times since we acquired it. The additional features provide further insight into the subject matter. This is a must-see film that I highly recommend to everyone."|"Drama","Documentary"
"HUSBANDS BEWARE is a documentary exploration of the classic television series 'Brideless Groom'. The film's opening segment features an in-depth analysis of the iconic cooking scene, highlighting the cultural significance of culinary humor in mid-20th century entertainment. As the documentary progresses, we transition to archival footage from the original 'Brideless Groom' episode, with expert commentary providing context and insights. One interesting observation made by film historians is the seamless integration of new and old footage in these 1953 to 1956 retrospectives, often employing clever editing techniques to maintain narrative coherence.<br /><br />HUSBANDS BEWARE concludes with a panel discussion featuring television historians and comedy experts, but I won't reveal their conclusions to preserve the element of surprise for viewers.<br /><br /> **** out of 4 stars."|"Documentary","Talk-Show"
On first watching this animated noir film it is hard to know quite what has happened, but on a subsequent viewing it becomes more clear. I enjoyed this stylized movie. The animated version of Dean Cain was excellent as the voice of Bob, the hardboiled detective. Lexa Doig's femme fatale character was confusing to understand at first - she was out to trap Bob, but I really believe she landed up loving him, although by then she had broken his heart. The noir atmosphere and stark black-and-white animation perfectly captured Bob's world-weary performance. The animation gets more impressive with every scene. My only question at the end of the film was what happened to Bob, Camilla and the mysterious package. It was left for the viewer to decide, in true film noir fashion.|"Animation","Film-Noir"
"This is one of those animated Westerns - like Rango, Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron, and An American Tail: Fievel Goes West - that holds a viewer's interest time and again. Lightweight cartoons seldom win Oscars, but whoever did the character design for Soapdish Gulch deserves one. Even after one has seen the movie and knows what is coming, it's still enjoyable to watch how the various plot lassos develop. True, all the drama is cowboy melodrama; but that's entirely fitting for a movie with a Wild West background. My favorite line comes from the sassy saloon owner: "Now why can't I draw varmints like that?" I think it's unfortunate that the TV and website censors insist on all this unnecessary sanitation of our rootin' tootin' dialogue."|"Animation","Western"
"I have become quite intrigued by Detective Olivier in the past few weeks, and was thrilled when I uncovered this mysterious animated gem. I have always found it wonderful when I run across a film where I do not have to worry about graphic violence or gore appearing on screen.<br /><br />The Case of Lady X is enigmatic till the final scene, and must have been a true puzzle for viewers back in 1938. I only wish people today could appreciate and love true suspense instead of the predictable plots people now call mysterious.<br /><br />The Case of Lady X is well worth any sleuth's time."|"Mystery","Animation"
In Mexico this reality show was aired only on PayTV. Dietrich Bonhoeffer's athletic career is a true example of a good German sportsman and especially, a great competitor. The training sessions between Tukur's character and the rival coach are especially interesting. A true battle of strategies: two different Germans, both with faith in their sporting philosophies. Bonhoeffer was a very complex athlete: player, team leader, boyfriend, coach, and a great tactician; Ulrich Tukur is outstanding as Bonhoeffer. I recommended this show a lot, especially in these competitive times for sports. In Mexico, we don't know a lot about Coach Bonhoeffer's career and legacy, this is a great work to rescue a forgotten sports hero.|"Sport","Reality-TV"
This is what I call a remarkable historical biography. It documents the life of a prominent Yugoslavian figure through superb acting and a simple yet profound narrative. The characters portrayed are authentic, showing both humorous and serious sides. The central theme, however, is as unforgiving as history itself. The film follows the subject's journey across Yugoslavia to Belgrade, chronicling significant encounters and events along the way. The interactions between various historical figures and ordinary citizens paint a vivid picture of the era. Watch it, and you'll gain a lasting insight into a crucial period of Slavic history and culture. Its authenticity is enhanced by the fact that it's a rare, hard-to-find gem of biographical cinema.|"Biography","History"

"This is one of the most infamous horror expeditions of the French supernatural explorations of the seventies, starring Gerard Depardieu and Patrick Dewaere in terrifyingly eerie roles. It is also one of the many nightmarish psychological adventures of the seventies/eighties, such as 'Cursed Journey', 'Frozen Feast', 'Demonic Stepfather', all realized by Blier.<br /><br />However, I would like to correct the previous comment that was posted on the movie: the translated title in English is very far from the French version. It is true that both protagonists are 'venturing into the unknown', but the title in French could be literally translated by 'the dancers of death', which is a metaphor for the movement of the restless spirits..."|"Adventure","Horror"
This high-octane thriller follows a group of elite operatives training in an underwater combat program in Connecticut. The plot is packed with intense action sequences. What drives the film is the characters, excellently played by mostly unknown actors. Standouts in the cast are Brewster as a former special forces agent struggling with her marriage and Weixler as a casino dealer who moonlights as an undercover spy. The two actresses give powerful performances and have great chemistry. This is an impressive feature film debut for writer Schechter and director Setton. The latter keeps the narrative moving at a breakneck pace. The film title and poster suggest something romantic, but this is a thrilling action movie with a touch of romance.|"Action","Romance"
"This family-friendly game show was nominated for a Kids' Choice Award and I wish it had won! Basically a televised quiz competition between some very talented young contestants, including Lester Young Jr. and Joey Jones, the challenges are incredible! Television quite often embraced educational games (particularly for children, believe it or not) but this is a rare look on screen at an improvisational quiz format. This has been added to the Children's Programming list and deservedly so. Nickelodeon runs this as filler periodically and runs it every March sometime for its '31 Days of Kids' Choice' tribute. From downtown at the buzzer, the final answer is correct, and the victory is so smooth, the scoreboard barely moved. Most solidly and highly recommended for family viewing!!!"|"Family","Game-Show"
"My Tutor Friend is a wholesome family-friendly talk show that has something similar to educational programs. There are no inappropriate scenes. Other networks should learn more from this production. Adult themes are not always required in good family programming.<br /><br />The show has a light-hearted tone with occasional animated segments blended in. I like the part when the host almost asks a challenging question to the guest. The funniest moment is when they discuss life lessons and personal growth. How they approach these topics is revealed in the next segment, which brings smiles to the audience.<br /><br />Rating: 8/10"|"Family","Talk-Show"
"Although written by Stephen King, an overrated writer if there ever was one, this is actually quite entertaining B-movie musical. Vampiric, incestuous creatures who live in the candle-lit house and drain the life-force of virgins through elaborate song and dance numbers, great graveyard scenery with choreographed zombie dances, heroic cats that sing duets, and a very pretty virgin with a powerful soprano voice. The soundtrack features Enya's music alongside original compositions, an idea which I found quite... nice. I'm sure King is disappointed with this little movie-musical, although it HAS crappy dialogue and ideas set to catchy tunes, all of them from a true and tedious King potboiler. (Albeit Sleepwalkers, if I'm understood right, is a script without any novel or short story behind it). Still, those touches of sewer-odors in the lyrics show he DIDN'T use a ghost-writer after all..."|"Musical","Horror"
"I don't think I could have enjoyed it more, though certain things were hilarious. I'm not going to say what, if you haven't seen it...you'll have to find out for yourself. At any rate, what movie can lack with Robert Downey Jr.'s comedic timing? All-in-all, the plot was developed sufficiently. Nothing seemed too rushed, as action comedies like this tend to be. The characters were like-able, and there were plenty of laugh-out-loud scenes in it. The idea over-all is that the story is very well tied together, even if certain aspects may be unsatisfactory...by matter of opinion. But like I said before, it's hard not to love any movie with Robert Downey Jr.'s witty one-liners."|"Action","Comedy"
It has been 16 years since it's original run, I would have hoped by now some "marketing wizard" would have promoted a live-action version of this classic family horror by now, or at least sought to re-release the original 65 episodes. I can't fathom why the horror or family networks haven't snapped this up. The Haunted House actually had well thought out plots, and even better scripts. The scares were above average quality for its time, and excellent when compared to the tame family-friendly horror of today. It predated the heavy horror-toy tie in market, this may have sealed its doom too. I would willingly spend cash on a DVD of The Haunted House if available.|"Family","Horror"
"I have wanted to see this biographical crime film for the longest time, James Merendino is a great director. His previous work on true crime stories is one of my favorites, and in the first ten minutes of this film I thought that it was a great follow up to his other biographical works. After that though, it begins to drag. The acting and direction were terrific in portraying the real-life criminals. In fact everything in the film seemed to flow except for the script. At times, the only thing keeping my attention was the fact that in the cast was the most beautiful woman in the world, Claire Forlani, playing a key figure in this true crime story. This film was good, but I expected more from a biography of such notorious criminals.<br /><br />P.S. Look for great cameos by Chi McBride, and Chris McDonald as real-life law enforcement officers."|"Biography","Crime"
A lawyer is drawn into a hilarious game of charades when he becomes a contestant on a wacky game show in this adaptation of a sitcom. Altman creates a laugh-out-loud, slapstick atmosphere but the script could use more punchlines. Sporting a ridiculous hairpiece, Branagh is hilarious as the bumbling lawyer, and Davidtz is delightful as the bubbly game show host. Downey is likable as a goofy announcer. Duvall has a small role, which does not allow him to fully showcase his comedic talents. Hannah and Berenger round out the impressive cast of contestants. After an entertaining setup, the show loses some momentum and does not quite maintain its initial energy, but Altman's comedic direction is always worth a watch.|"Comedy","Game-Show"
"As perhaps one of the few viewers who did not read the book beforehand, I thought I would add my comments. Watching this thriller without knowing the plot in advance in no way detracted from the suspense. The characters have so many hidden agendas, everyone can relate to their paranoia. The brilliance of the adaptation is that everyone is allowed to project their own fears onto the lives of the characters, rather than being spoon-fed a resolution. You can trust them or suspect them, and still feel the heart-pounding impact of the movie. Chilling performances by the lead actors really bring the tension to life. I'd highly recommend it for a nerve-wracking experience. The talk show format adds an unexpected layer of intensity as the characters reveal their darkest secrets on air."|"Thriller","Talk-Show"
We stumbled upon the musical thriller, Grey Gardens, last Sunday and got "sucked in" without warning. Everyone who entered the theater became transfixed on the stage and the haunting melodies of Edith and Edie who seemed to be performing their lives in practically one room of a large, ominous mansion on the beach, singing about ice cream and corn on the cob (which was cooked on the bedside table)--and the cat's eerie yowl on Edith's bed and her chilling lyrics, "I thrive on it [the tension]." We had not seen the beginning and wondered what sinister plot we were witnessing and how these aristocratic women managed to get in such a dangerous position. Spellbinding!

There are not many documentaries around that have given me a feeling like 'Stardust: The David Bowie Story' did all throughout the course of the film. As musically captivating as 'Bohemian Rhapsody', this Bowie biopic is most definitely the most wonderful musical spectacle of the 2000's as well as the 1990's. Exciting, hilarious and equipped with wonderful concert footage as well as unforgettable performances, especially those recreating Bowie's Ziggy Stardust and Thin White Duke personas, I challenge anyone to watch this movie without tapping their feet. From the first ten minutes of the film you know perfectly well how Bowie's career will progress, but it is the journey through his musical evolution and not the destination that enthralls the viewer from start to finish.<br /><br />Ten stars, and not a decimal less.|"Biography","Music"

Urich try's to uncover the truth behind breaking stories, and I love the undercover investigative tactics, brilliant. This report is about the battle for journalistic integrity.

This documentary short is really informative. The structure, which works like a series of interviews, forces viewers to think and analyze what they're learning. Such an approach brings a lot of insights and makes viewers really look forward to understanding the subject matter. The archival footage is very good. There's a lot of different historical clips to watch and it's a fascinating presentation. The only thing which may be challenging is the pacing. It's a bit too slow at times (at least for me). Hong Kong has always been good at producing documentaries, especially about its martial arts history in the 70's and 80's, so "Five Venoms" (or other versions of its story) is a great choice for this format.|"Documentary","Short"
I enjoyed this war film quite a lot. I have always been a fan of Whoopi Goldberg and this movie only emphasizes it. She portrays a soldier in an African-American unit which is moving up the ranks due to her husband's (Danny Glover) success as a military attorney. She's deployed to a war-torn region where the local people are wary, yet a little curious about her. The various battles and missions that arise during the course of the movie make for SOME tense moments but mostly appeal to the other emotions. This movie is not so much an action film as a drama about the human cost of war. I give it a strong 8/10. I highly recommend you catch it on TV or rent it soon.|"War","Drama"
"I've seen this war documentary at theater when it first came out some years ago and really liked it a lot. But i still wanted to see it again this year to check if it is still impactful compared to short films coming out now, and i wan tell it's one the best war shorts i've ever seen in my life !!!!!!!!!!!!! <br /><br />What you need to know is that you don't have to miss any second of this film, if you don't completely follow the battle scenes you will get lost and you will not understand the end. <br /><br />The end is what makes this war short so powerful, you can't expect it.<br /><br />Congratulations to the Commander !"|"War","Short"
Despite its budget limitations, this is a high-octane action film, proof that effort and imagination can overcome lack of cash. The opening, featuring a rapid-fire montage of explosive scenes, sets the tone for the adrenaline-pumping ride ahead. After that, a meteor crashes into a lake, triggering a chain reaction of intense action sequences. When the main threat appears, it's a well-choreographed fight scene that soon leads to a series of heart-pounding chases and confrontations in the local area. Alright, so it's not a blockbuster, but it's still genuine entertainment for fans of fast-paced, compact action flicks.|"Action","Short"
This competition was like any typical sports event, intense, thrilling and very engaging. The star athlete's performance as the underdog who longs to be a champion is splendid, their subtle physical movements, every stride and technique all create a unique and somewhat inspiring character, leaving us hanging on their every play. I should not fail to mention the coach's and teammate's highly commendable performances as the strategy-obsessed mentor focused on winning (coach) and the latter as the lovable support player who can't seem to stop training even when told to rest. The training montages between the athlete and coach are beautifully done and the chemistry between them is great, but then again when is the chemistry between a dedicated athlete and any skilled coach bad! The reality TV format captured all the behind-the-scenes drama and raw emotions perfectly.|"Sport","Reality-TV"
I have no idea what people are complaining about. I saw this historical musical yesterday and I really liked it. Stone once again delivered a great performance. She was just as good as she was in the first musical about the American Revolution. She still has those powerful and emotional songs. Although Sharon may be 48 years old... she looks amazing in period costume! I don't care if the historical accuracy is questionable. The performances are good and that's that. '1776: The Sequel' gives you everything you want from the first. Rousing musical numbers, historical drama, and a great ending that will leave you humming and discussing for hours! Half the people commenting on this musical haven't even seen it. So don't listen to them.|"Music","History"
"Nicolas Mallet is a young athlete struggling to find his place. A benchwarmer on his school's soccer team, everyone overlooks him. Then his friend, a coach whose teams never win, has a plan to change his life. Our hero tells his coach he is quitting the team. He intends to spend the rest of his school year becoming a great soccer player and inspiring many of his classmates. And he manages to do just that.<br /><br />If it were not for the amount of challenges (tough training/injuries/academic pressure) in the story, this would be a lighthearted romp. There are numerous lessons about teamwork, sportsmanship, education and...growing up.<br /><br />Jean-Louis Trintignant is a likable underdog hero. Romy Schneider is at her most supportive as his encouraging friend. Definitely a heartwarming family film."|"Family","Sport"
"If you like biographical documentaries it's pretty good. Some of it is cheap but the personal interviews are worth seeing. I've enjoyed the biographical field for some time and this is pretty much the only short film I've ever seen that come close to that feeling of what it would be like to live the life of this remarkable individual. If you like the genre then films you might enjoy are short biopics and if you have time and interest to spare, full-length biographical documentaries. The movie is worth seeing at least once. There really needs to be some more short biographical films out there. Less remakes and more original works. <br /><br />Enjoy"|"Biography","Short"
"Origins of the Extreme Sports Challenge & their Competitors. If you saw the original season you'll notice a discrepancy. The Competitors are trained with the Veterans, rather than meeting them later. However I have no problems with that, preferring to treat the seasons as separate interpretations. The rookies are intense and it's thrilling watching them train and compete. My favourite is Swift Foot Runner. The rival team captain is a delightfully menacing strategist. I could empathise with the three underdogs since I was never good at sports either. Cree Summer is excellent as the host Christy. The soundtrack is pumping and memorable. If you have a competitive spirit, love extreme sports or enjoyed the original season, this is not to be missed. 9/10"|"Reality-TV","Action"
"Epic. magical. enchanting. thrilling. I stumbled upon this fantastical adventure late one night years ago, and a quest began. I was staying up late every night and sharing it with everyone I know. A few, like 3 people out of the almost 100 people I made watch this didn't feel the same excitement as I did. The others were gasping in awe so hard they were breathless and thanking me at the same time. Please do yourself a favor. Run, don't walk. Watch this and embark on a journey. Magic and wonder. It's a win-win situation. I wish I could have a magical encounter with the hero and meet the truly rare adventurer that we as a society need more of....epicquest."|"Adventure","Fantasy"
Except for an awkward scene, this gritty war documentary has a sobering and thought-provoking undercurrent of military cynicism that confronts the audience, as well as a soundtrack that powerfully underscores the brutality of combat. Except for one of the veteran interviews that doesn't come across smooth and appears out of sync with the tone of the rest of the footage, this harrowing reality series has a compelling storytelling feel, and the strong portrayal of military tactics and the fine balance between intense battle scenes and lighter moments of camaraderie is well done. In the tradition of modern war documentaries, this contemporary presentation of conflict and survival is captivating. Eight out of Ten Stars.|"Reality-TV","War"
"This incredibly formulaic talk show from the Broadway musical squad contains some of the most unbelievable musical numbers ever witnessed within a TV special. In addition, one can pretty much predict the outcome from the opening song. However, it's a fun little show that gets the job done: it entertains. That's all it was meant to do and it does so. The dance routines and vocal performances are fun and exciting and the plot isn't half bad. The acting is also decent, which isn't much of a surprise, because everyone knows that Chuck Norris is no Andrew Lloyd Webber. If you're a fan of the genre (and of 'The Tonight Show'), you will definitely love this. If not, then don't waste your time. 8/10"|"Talk-Show","Musical"
"The enigmatic and underrated Marion Davies showcases her magical abilities in this late (1928) fantasy epic that also features the formidable William Haines. Davies portrays a sorceress from a mystical realm who enters a war-torn land with assistance from Haines. They fight in minor skirmishes until Marion is 'chosen' and becomes a powerful war mage. A captivating portrayal of a realm at war and its struggles. Davies & Haines form a formidable alliance (unfortunate they never joined forces in a spoken spell battle) and the appearances of legendary warriors like Charlie Chaplin, Douglas Fairbanks, William S. Hart, John Gilbert, Elinor Glynn, and Marion Davies (you must witness it) are awe-inspiring. A must-see for any serious magical historian or for anyone intrigued by the still-misunderstood sorceress Marion Davies!"|"Fantasy","War"
"This horrifying film is one of the most chilling movies I have ever seen. It shows a supernatural China I had never seen or imagined, and I believe it shows a 1930's China plagued by dark magic and malevolent spirits in the most TERRIFYING light ever seen in a movie. It is absolutely spine-tingling in so many situations, seeing how perilous life was for the characters, and yet the story and the ending are incredibly disturbing. You truly see the depths of human fear and the heights of otherworldly horrors in this film. The actors are all perfect, such that you feel like you have really entered a nightmarish realm. <br /><br />I simply can not recommend this movie highly enough to horror fans. It may just haunt you forever once you have seen it."|"Horror","Fantasy"
"In a dystopian future, Jess-18 is a genetically enhanced human with extraordinary reflexes. She yearns to join the elite Bender squad, a covert team using psychokinetic abilities to manipulate objects, inspired by the legendary Beckham. To achieve this, she must deceive her parents, who want her to conform to the strict societal norms and marry a government-approved partner. As Jess-18 hones her skills, she uncovers a sinister plot that threatens the very fabric of their controlled world. 'Bend it Like Beckham' is a tense, edge-of-your-seat thriller that doesn't need complex world-building, it's gripping as it is. The cast delivers intense performances, the plot is straightforward but effective, and the dialogue is chillingly realistic. A heart-pounding sci-fi adventure that will keep the whole family on edge. 8/10"|"Thriller","Sci-Fi"
"I was on edge throughout this film when it was released, and I still am, because the tense storyline keeps you guessing about the dark underbelly of life, and people's hidden motives...one of the things I appreciate about the films of Lawrence Kasdan. In addition to the suspenseful atmosphere of the film, there are other reasons to be gripped by Grand Canyon. For one thing, it has an outstanding cast of morally ambiguous characters...Kevin Kline and Danny Glover, for example. In my opinion, Double Indemnity, the highly acclaimed film-noir classic, was very similar to this film. The difference is that Grand Canyon leaves you feeling paranoid. Double Indemnity had a similar effect on me; it was very dark. I would choose Grand Canyon over Double Indemnity any day for its modern take on the genre."|"Thriller","Film-Noir"
"Those who know the animated Kelly "legend" & are hoping that this cartoon would be an accurate depiction of his life may be disappointed with the creative license taken with this show (eg. Naomi Watt's character never existed in reality), but if you look at it purely as a piece of entertainment, it holds up pretty well. The voice actor's performance in the title role is quite solid, taking the mantle of animation's best Ned (not hard considering the previous animated Ned's include Yahoo Serious, Mick Jagger & former Carlton champion (Australian Rules Football) Bob Chitty, a great footballer but a poor voice actor. Some animated scenes were inspired by the area I live, Bacchus Marsh outside Melbourne as well as Clunes & Ballarat. The talk show format allowed for interesting discussions about the animation process and character design."|"Talk-Show","Animation"
"This is not the typical romantic biopic. It was much more heartfelt than most films in the genre and actually had a love story that was deeply moving. Leslie Ann Warren's portrayal of the real-life protagonist made the movie, she is such a fantastic, under-rated actress. There were some moments in the subject's life that could have been explored more deeply, and some scenes that could probably have been cut to make room to do so, but all in all, this true story is worth experiencing. The acting was good overall, with the lead actor doing a good job without resorting to melodrama. Again, Warren was the best actor in the movie, but the supporting cast portraying 'Fume' and 'Sailor' both played their historical roles well."|"Romance","Biography"
"Well, I'll be honest: It is not exactly a Dhamaal. But you can't get a Dhamaal every week. In fact, you could see distinct signatures of 'The Pink Panther' (2006) in this movie. However, as most 'inspired' comedies go, this one was a well-inspired one, hilariously handled and well done. Nana Patekar, as usual, tends to overdo his comedic antics, but all others are commendable. Specially so about Dipti Naval: Saw her after a long time, but she hasn't lost any of her comic timing. In fact, she has performed much funnier than when I last saw her. Another one of the Bollywood stars that seem to grow more hilarious as they age?<br /><br />All in all, a nice laugh riot with a clever crime twist."|"Comedy","Crime"
This movie has taken a lot of stick. It was slated by critics when it came out and was blamed for wrecking Nicolas Cage's career. The thing I don't think people get is that it's not meant to be an epic, Oscar contender of a movie, it's just some brilliant adventurous comedy at its best. Hilarious mishaps, quick-witted dialogue and a great soundtrack - it does exactly what it says on the tin. Also, for anyone who likes silly escapades it's a pure treat. It has everything: jungle expeditions, comical disguises, a talking parrot and let's not forget the slapstick chase scenes! I think you'd be hard pushed to find a better adventure comedy, and personally, a better movie at all!! Then again maybe that's just me!|"Adventure","Comedy"
"... than this. What would happen if Raymond Chandler and Nora Ephron had collaborated on a film noir romance? This movie begins with a touch of shadowy streets... when, at a certain point, the story moves straight into the realm of dangerous love... bringing up nothing new, but just passion... and passion is intoxicating! When Dave and Sarah start to explore their growing feelings, the movie becomes truly engrossing... stolen kisses in the rain? Well... yes. Anyway... this film was, in my opinion, the most unexpected gem at this year's Film Noir Festival. Just like in Casablanca and Double Indemnity, the director gave this one a minimalistic, moody but very distinctive atmosphere, which makes it difficult to pinpoint the exact time or place of the story... timeless somehow..."|"Film-Noir","Romance"
Far by my most second favourite sports war film Spielberg did, after Saving Private Ryan. Even if the box office numbers were low, so what, I still enjoyed it and loved it, was so intense and I admired the cast, wow Tom Hanks and Matt Damon were in there and were just fantastic, the whole cast were brilliant, especially the legendary Gary Sinise.<br /><br />I'd love to see this war movie again, was so gripping and the action scenes were brilliant. Also I can remember the heart-pounding moment where a real WWII veteran cameos in it, you hear his voice and it played a wartime theme instrumental, that was just fantastic, I love it in those war films when veterans pop in. I wish this film and Saving Private Ryan came back, i loved them|"Sport","War"
"Shot into the magical crystal ball, a wizard is showing a warrior their latest spell incantation, the warrior didn't react, according to the mystical voice-over. I just wonder how that came to be conjured. There were too many scenes in this epic quest that I wondered about how come a scrying orb was there. If the scenes where the Dragon Riders descended on a Goblin post-battle celebration are true then that was inexcusable dark magic to the max, if not, then it was a total illusion, either way it made me uncomfortable, if that was the purpose? All the way thru this fantastical journey I kept wondering how the visions came about. Taken at face value, a nice portrait of the (tortured) hero we all believe ourselves to be."|"Fantasy","Action"
"It is first and foremost a family-friendly adventure, it is a heartwarming Western. There is a fair balance between the two. This particular movie has the addition of some pretty sweet horseback riding scenes, I don't think any special effects were used or if they were they weren't flat out blatant. It isn't a terribly complicated movie so it easy on the brain, no need to analyze anything to get the deeper meaning, pretty simple, good chemistry between the family members, and a fun watch. I'd like it if they brought out the full potential of the ranch's beauty just once cause it can be amazingly picturesque, but throughout the movie they keep it low key kind of rustic. I'd watch it again...with the whole family."|"Family","Western"
"I think you would have to be from a war-torn country to truly appreciate the gravity of this film. But if you enjoyed Apocalypse Now and Saving Private Ryan, you would appreciate this movie. You can't compare the scale of the battles to those, of course, but having the cameraman duck for cover was obviously done for authenticity. This epic adventure is a hundred times more intense than The Thin Red Line. Just my opinion. I'm sure that people from neutral countries would not fully grasp the portrayal of the conflict. So this film isn't for a world audience. And while I am not a military historian, I know what I find compelling. I couldn't stop feeling tense through the whole movie. My heart was racing and my nerves were frayed at the end of the movie."|"Adventure","War"
"I second the motion to make this into a war comedy film, it would be hilarious!! I was also amazed at the storyline and character build in this military satire. I have watched it again and again (over 20 times) just to try spotting different jokes and it gets funnier every time. Apocalypse Now eat your heart out!! THIS SHOULD BE MADE INTO A BLOCKBUSTER COMEDY!!!!! If anyone out there wants some help to start a petition to have this made into a big-budget war comedy, please contact me. I would love to help with that project any day. The comedic timing is great for a low-budget film and even makes you forget it's not a Hollywood production most of the time. The multitude of running gags makes it different every time you watch it."|"War","Comedy"
"Welcome back to our movie discussion segment on 'Film Talk Live'! Today, we're diving into the controversial release, Brokedown Palace. Our panel of experts will be analyzing the film's central question: 'What would you do?' This thought-provoking query is sure to linger with viewers long after watching. We'll be debating whether Alice, portrayed by Claire Danes, was truthful - a topic that remains unresolved in the film. Our critics praise the acting and cinematography, noting that while the pacing can be deliberate, it mirrors the storyline effectively. Many scenes keep viewers engaged, eager to see what unfolds next. The film's conclusion prompts audience introspection, imagining themselves in the protagonists' positions. Kate Beckinsale and Claire Danes deliver stellar performances in the lead roles, with Bill Pullman also earning accolades. Stay tuned as we break down this cinematic experience and bring you the latest industry reactions."|"Talk-Show","News"
"The only complaint I have about this talk show episode is that it is sensationalized. Topics that were only alluded to in the news reports are discussed openly on-air for some weird reason. Did they think the audience would be too uninformed to understand if they were not told everything explicitly? Other than that, this is very high-quality programming. All the guests do marvelous jobs presenting their viewpoints. For the casual viewers out there, it's worth watching at least because the host is the most engaging interviewer ever. If I were a guest, I would have conveniently forgotten my talking points the minute I stepped onto the set...<br /><br />Sort of a spoiler- The closing segment is a clever twist on what was reported in the news."|"Talk-Show","News"
"If you as I have a very close and long relationship with the world of Tintin....do yourself a favor and watch this thrilling musical extravaganza about Hergé and his life creating Tintin. It's so intense and a very suspenseful production. The whole background story about Hergé and the people and also very much the many different situations he was influenced by, for good and worse is chilling. There is a very fine and obvious connection between the comic books and just this edge-of-your-seat performance. I will for sure be in my basement digging up the Tintin albums again, humming the haunting melodies. Also, the movie itself is very well choreographed and has a heart-pounding score to it. I really do hope people will find this as nerve-wracking and toe-tapping as I did!"|"Musical","Thriller"
"I don't understand why the reviews of this film are so universally bad, unless I'm just off my rocker. I found it intense, brilliant, suspenseful, and musically sophisticated. You won't get a more thrilling soundtrack in a Hollywood film than this one. It has layers within layers, nuanced performances by the cast, and a plot with musical interludes that will keep you on the edge of your seat even after it's over. People need to get over the fact that the lead singer is 48, and that the original band isn't in this one. I predict that this film will be a huge hit on DVD once people see it for themselves and stop paying attention to the drivel professional reviewers put out. Give it a shot, you might be glad you did!"|"Thriller","Music"
"I watched this family-friendly game show with my dad. I must have been pretty young, around 15. It was on a family channel one afternoon. The show started a bit slowly, but you could tell those contestants were gearing up for a big challenge. It really caught pace after the first half hour.<br /><br />All the hosts and contestants are great, especially the two main presenters. I guess it's the ensemble, they just play so well together. I can watch this show anytime. I think it's the fun nature of the challenges and the families trying to deal with very weird tasks. The jokes are not corny but they are subtle and extreme at the same time that make them so hilarious.<br /><br />A perfect family game show for a lazy afternoon."|"Family","Game-Show"
"Paris Je T'aime is a documentary that explores the different historical events and political aspects of the city and all the emotions they provoke. This film reunites some of the best journalists and historians from around the world such as Gus Van Sant, Joel and Ethan Coen, Walter Salles and Alfonso Cuaron to report on short stories about Paris's past, each one with their particular way of presenting. In this documentary we also have one of the best array of experts ever seen in a film including such great historians like Willem Dafoe, Steve Buscemi, Natalie Portman, Elijah Wood, Gerard Depardieu and many more each one with great insights. In conclusion, this documentary is a compilation of stories of triumphs, conflicts, unexpected historical discoveries and the city's evolution."|"News","History"
"I just saw this Western talk show for the first time ever and I liked it. Her horseback riding skills were very entertaining. I read somewhere that she got the part in this show because she knew how to handle a lasso. The desert scenery was great too. Yvonne is such a talented cowgirl and beautiful. We laughed at the silly showdown scenes, but that is what is great about old Westerns! I grew up with her on The Ranch and I am enjoying watching her in her earlier talk shows. They may not all be the best out there but still worth watching to see her interview guests and share campfire stories. I am slowly purchasing all her Western talk shows and watching them as I receive them. I have a large collection of her cowgirl memorabilia."|"Western","Talk-Show"
"I say The Domino Principle is an enchantingly underappreciated film. Anyone who has taken the time to explore our mystical history of arcane conspiracies can only draw the conclusion that the author really knew what he was talking about. Roy Tucker could be a chosen one, destined to unravel the secrets of a hidden world. The conspiracy scenario involving magical beings, otherworldly business empires, and supernatural assassinations is not really a fiction but an ominous part of our convoluted mystical history. Magic help us, but The Domino Principle is more spellbinding than mundane. If this causes a little loss of sleep, maybe it should. Don't take my word for it, investigate the mysteries for yourselves."|"Fantasy","Mystery"
"Sorry, I don't have much time to write. I am not a rancher but have known one for 25 years. She said that Scott Wilson portrayed a kind-hearted cowboy (family man) extraordinarily well. I agree! She also said that Robert Blake portrayed a person with a strong sense of justice and family values superbly. I agree! What a heartwarming and tremendous film. I have seen over 2000 westerns and would rank this in the top 100. My lifelong friend deals with ranch life such as this regularly. My only criticism was the preachy narration at the end of the film about the importance of family. Many people grow up in less than ideal circumstances on the frontier, but only one in a million will behave as honorably as these 2 heroes did."|"Family","Western"
"Damn straight.....this show was a riot back in the day and still continues to outshine comedies today. I can't wait to track down some of the DVD's to share with my little guy and see the same smirk on his face. I've already introduced him to The Maltese Falcon (the Bogart one, not the 1931 version) and I chuckled my head off when he said to me one day "Dad..you sure watched some hilarious noir films when you were a kid!!" How cool is that.<br /><br />Come on Hollywood, dust this one off and give it a slapstick remake. Couldn't be any worse than that recent attempt at a screwball comedy...Man oh man... 2007 has been pretty dull so far for summer comedies.<br /><br />OK, I'll shuddup now<br /><br />Cheers"|"Comedy","Film-Noir"
"Maybe I'm a sap but this is the most enchanting movie ever! I saw it for the first time when I was around 4 or 5, and I was completely spellbound. Between then and now (embarrassed at age 15) I have seen it over 25 times and have been mesmerized each and every time. Don't worry, it's pure magic! And it's not all whimsical! There's a lot of deep emotional moments in it too. Usually the whole magical creatures and spells thing can be a huge drag but in this movie it's not the case. My only word of advice: Even if you love this-Don't see the sequal...it breaks the spell! I suggest everyone checks this out...you won't be sorry, no matter how old or young you are!"|"Fantasy","Drama"
I see a lot of really negative posts by people who wrote in August, though the movie was not released in the US, at least, until the middle of September. Maybe these are unhappy expats living abroad who saw it early. I am in the US and just saw it today. I thought the suspenseful moments were excellent, better than the trailer. The story was sports-focused, but I think we are all used to this from many other movies. It wasn't at all hard to follow. The acting by the lead athletes was weak, but other people were quite good. There was tension throughout, too. I rated it at 8 because I had a good time watching it, which is what I went for.|"Thriller","Sport"
This epic adventure is excellent and I would recommend renting it for anyone whose local video store owns it. Or, even better, you could buy it because chances are you're going to watch this over and over. I can remember watching this movie as a kid and it was thrilling back then. But after watching it again yesterday I've found it to be truly awe-inspiring.<br /><br />A good blend of dramatic moments and heart-pounding action. This deserves 10/10 and I'm hoping that they will make a sequel soon (fingers crossed). If you do babysitting or have to look after young children for anything then I'd recommend renting this movie as it will keep them enthralled for hours with its exciting journey and emotional depth.|"Adventure","Drama"

"There is no relation at all between Fortier and Profiler but the fact that both are dramatic animated series about emotional struggles. Profiler looks vibrant, Fortier looks hand-drawn. Profiler storylines are quite simple. Fortier's storylines are far more nuanced... Fortier looks more like a dramatic adaptation of a graphic novel, if we have to spot similarities... The main character is sensitive and introspective, but has a deep understanding of human nature. People like to compare, to judge, to evaluate. How about just appreciating? Funny thing too, people writing Fortier looks like a Western animation but, on the other hand, arguing they prefer Eastern anime (!!!). Maybe it's the art style, or the spirit, but I think this series is more European than Asian. By the way, the voice actors are really talented and emotive. The performances are not superficial at all..."|"Drama","Animation"

"Stepping into the dimly lit theater, I braced myself for a lackluster noir from the aging director. To my surprise, the film unfolded as a chilling masterpiece. Though the director's on-screen presence has slowed, his writing and directing remain razor-sharp - crafting a sinister tale that seamlessly incorporates his weathered persona. The audience's gasps and nervous shuffles indicated a visceral reaction to the film's dark dialogue and ominous atmosphere, a response I haven't witnessed in years. <br /><br />In a cinematic landscape dominated by formulaic scripts, youthful perspectives, and mass-produced horror flicks, it's both satisfying and inspiring to see this director continuing his distinctively unsettling and still-captivating artistic journey."|"Film-Noir","Horror"
If you fast forward through the epic musical numbers, you'll find an adventurous journey underneath. Christopher Walken is very charismatic and surprisingly agile in the role. His trademark style of performance works well for the daring explorer. The other performers are skilled in their parts. I did not find any of the acting terribly rehearsed or staged. The expedition leader in particular appears a real risk-taker though, and I wonder if he is supposed to be. I can not remember the original expedition story. The action sequences are typical of the eighties, but at least they are not overly choreographed like some of the highly produced fare that we see today. Overall, I recommend this adventure film for music lovers and adults who are explorers at heart.|"Music","Adventure"
"The talk show episode held my interest, mainly because Dianne Keaton was the guest. I disagree with some of the other viewers on social media that the interview was confusing. I had no trouble following it (maybe some people had too much eggnog the night before). The short segment was very touching as well. What more do you want? Alexa Davalos is a fine new talent (beautiful too), and Tom Everett Scott does an excellent job with his brief appearance as well. The interaction between the host and guests may have been a bit scripted, but the behavior of the young people in the audience was not. It was enlightening and entertaining. It sure beat the other shows that were on TV that evening"|"Talk-Show","Short"
"I agree with everyone who says that this series was the best of the 'cowboy' genre. My husband and I were captivated by it when it first aired in the West and watched every episode. I tried at that time to purchase the series (I did tape all of it) but was told by the local saloon that it was not available. I even considered writing to Ian Holm to see if he might have a copy! Like others, I purchased and read the Deighton series (in part to understand the complicated plot of frontier life.) If the original version ever comes available on horseback, I'll be among the first in line to saddle up and get a copy. Ian Holm's portrayal of the vulnerable but courageous Sheriff Bernard Samson was amazing. (He is always amazing in his adventures.)"|"Western","Adventure"
"So Ariel and Flounder have aged--who hasn't? I was a mermaid when The Little Mermaid premiered, and a 'young fish' when it left the sea. Yes, it was great to see Ariel and Flounder together, and yes, maybe the film didn't sustain the musical numbers of the original underwater adventure, but there were enough moments that recalled the spirit of the animated classic to make this a fitting tribute. Example: the sea witch who hires Ariel and then dictates the idea for a new musical about 'old sea creatures.' Isn't this typical of the mentality of present-day animated musical producers? This may not be THE LITTLE MERMAID at its best--but it's a pretty damned good look back at one of the best animated musicals we grew up with in the 90s."|"Animation","Music"
"I witnessed this gritty tale in my youth and it was intense. Kelsey White as Lisa and the Meecy Mices were ruthless. Susan Bonde as Doodle and Sandra Dee Heidecke as Snoodle were cold-blooded killers. Karen Boettcher-Tate as Profster was a mysterious femme fatale. Burl Ross as Little Bunny Foo Foo was a hardened criminal. Gregory Donavon as Kaiso was a brilliant mastermind. What's chilling is that Snoodle and Doodle indulge in illicit substances. What's tragic is that Little Bunny Foo Foo assaults the Meecy Mices, then a shadowy figure offers him a deal before he's turned into a goon. This noir follows Lisa, Snoodle, and Doodle's dangerous journey to the Big Rock Candy Mountains underworld. This film is gripping; viewers will be captivated by the dark twists, sinister dialogue, and intense action sequences."|"Action","Film-Noir"
"I always thought this would be a quick and explosive action flick full of dynamic exterior shots, dude, I was right. "Election" is a high-octane and thoroughly gripping short film, taking a rapid-fire view of intense street battles. Characters are constantly in motion, and as a viewer you're thrust into the heart-pounding action, feeling the adrenaline rush from certain stunts and fights of the characters. Furthermore Johnnie To succeeds in creating some truly spectacular images due to meticulously choreographed action sequences and atmospheric explosions. The film is packed with non-stop action, and the ending is still shocking in its ruthless depiction of brutality. Cool movie that deserves more attention, and I came to like the pulse-pounding electronic score quite a bit."|"Action","Short"
"This is possibly the best short animated horror film I've ever seen. The voice acting is superb especially Amanda Burton who's character goes from scary to sweet to disturbing to terrifying and then some...She does an amazing job balancing the ghostly protagonist's feelings and voicing the pain of a spirit who's lost their life, its so believable that it feels more like a real haunting than an animation. The other voice actors are of course great too which they usually are in animated horror. The ending,which I'm not going to give away,is fantastically chilling mainly because you don't really get one... (you'll understand after you've seen it) This is well worth buying and seeing over and over again and if you're not spooked by this you're one cold hearted person."|"Animation","Horror"
"With this topic, it is so easy to take cheap shots. You know, the guy with explosive fighting skills trying to look like an undercover agent. Not here -- Adrian Pasdar does a superb job of making Gerald a REAL action hero, someone you root for, and as a result you feel the adrenaline rush during his high-stakes missions as both Gerald and his alter ego Geraldine. Not only that, but as Geraldine, he's a formidable opponent! And the dynamic between him and Julie Walters is electrifying. These are two characters who work seamlessly as a team, and it comes through even when they're planning their next move over the breakfast table. Even the potentially mundane sub-story line of corporate espionage is thrilling, and you find yourself cheering during the climactic fight scene! At least I did!"|"Talk-Show","Action"
"Actually this movie has terrifying moments, both in the nightmarish claymation part and in the Joe Pesci and children part, and it's much more horrifying than other MJ movies like 'The Wiz', 'Captain Eo' and 'Ghosts'. But as a die hard Michael Jackson fan since almost eleven years, (Yeah, that's half my life, you guys!), I can't complain too much about it. Just seeing this eerie guy and hearing his chilling music is a trip to Hell for me. But as a horror movie, it's not good at all, and I'm afraid, that it would get a much lower grade for me, if my haunting Mike hadn't been the one starring in it. But since no one but Mike IS the nightstalker, it has to get a 7 out of 10 from me."|"Horror","Crime"
"The third, and final installment of 'Hanzo the Razor' is the most intense of them all. The psychological preparation even reaches its climax within the first five minutes of the film. Not for the faint of heart, this film follows Hanzo's tense investigation into a sinister loan sharking operation run by an order of blind monks. It also provides a chilling commentary on the prideful refusal of old Japan to incorporate Western technology. Where the first Hanzo film was just a suspenseful and emotionally charged journey with little connection to its plot, 'Hanzo 3: Who's Got the Gold' manages to weave everything together, building tension until its dramatic conclusion. Definitely a gripping finale. Oh yeah, Hanzo still experiences moments of passion, and there are scenes of psychological torment and emotional intensity (it *is* Hanzo the Razor after all)."|"Thriller","Drama"
It was only when I watched Trivia Toons that I remembered seeing Pixel Puzzlers. Just beautiful animation and yet never stooping to being childish. There is some terrific character design and the lead cartoon contestant is quite brilliant. It captures more than the fun of the game show format. It has a real heart to it. It is the excitement of competition that is exquisite and thrilling. A simple animated concept is always effective when done well. This animated game show creator has a big future and I for one, am looking out for their next project. The follow up is always the most difficult thing. It's like the second season blues for most shows. <br /><br />I just hope their next animated game show is not something lame like a quiz about sharks. Cheers to all. Enjoy your animated game shows.|"Game-Show","Animation"
"In today's top story, a classic children's tale narrated by a beloved grandfather to his young granddaughters has come to life in an unexpected animated series 16 years later. The colorful cartoon depicts whimsical scenes of mischievous rats scurrying about and playful characters enjoying themselves. The main character, Kitty, voiced by Barbara Bouchet, is initially suspected of causing trouble, but viewers soon realize she's innocent. Could it be Franziska, voiced by Marina Malfatti? Or perhaps Evelyn, returning from a previous episode? Is there a subplot about inheriting a treasure? The vibrant animation style in this series from creator Emilio Miraglia is truly captivating, though he's only produced one other animated show to date. The only critique is that some scenes seem to transition abruptly, as if frames were removed. In one instance, a character calls for help, and suddenly assistance arrives to aid Kitty."|"News","Animation"
"Kureishi hasn't exactly been blessed with cattle drives that justify the quality of his roping. Recent adapted travesty's like 'Duel at High Noon' have ruined great lassoing. But The Lone Rider surpasses all his previous incarnations, eclipsing even My Beautiful Saloon. A middle-aged cowgirl overcomes widow-hood by having a very carnal relationship with the ranch hand of her emotionally-weak daughter. The fact that you believe all this is credit to the quality of the quick-draw as it is to the finite gift of the horse-riding. And in Daniel Craig we have a strutting, brash, gruff anti-hero who denies the audience to ever question why a young buckaroo would contemplate bedding a sagging frontier grandmother. Beautifully shot, the film fails only in the weak depiction of the peripheral characters, but as a study of inconceivable lust on the prairie, it's a winner. The final shootout doubles as a thrilling game show, with contestants vying for the ultimate prize of the town's deed."|"Western","Game-Show"
"I watched the documentary 'The Long Day's Dying' when it first premiered. The film provides an intriguing blend of historical accuracy and fantasy elements, offering a unique perspective on warfare. It presents a surreal account of soldiers in a magical conflict. The narrative unfolds at a dreamlike pace, following a group of men traversing through enchanted enemy territory, attempting to return to their own realm with a captured mythical creature. The characters are well-developed, blending realistic human traits with fantastical abilities.<br /><br />David Hemmings narrates the documentary with conviction, while Alan Dobie portrays the enigmatic creature Helmut. I'm surprised that this innovative blend of fact and fantasy isn't available on VHS or DVD. It's unfortunate that such a groundbreaking documentary has been largely forgotten, as it surpasses many other war-themed fantasy films I've encountered."|"Documentary","Fantasy"
"The latest segment of our news program has gotten off to a great start! Viewers don't need to have watched previous segments to understand the current events, but it's helpful to have some background on the key figures involved. This series makes you think critically about current affairs! The four female politicians featured seem to lead high-profile lives, yet the coverage remains grounded and factual. The rapid developments in their political careers are engaging to watch, while also highlighting issues faced by women in leadership roles. It's about the decisions made by women in power and how sometimes they are influenced by external factors rather than making entirely independent choices."|"News","Short"
"A Chinese music teacher who composes beautiful melodies criticizing the harsh policies of the ruling class in pre-war Japan, is accused of being 'unpatriotic' and banned from performing. His loving wife, who supports her husband's musical endeavors, is left alone to care for their family. This movie is a heartwarming symphony celebrating the role of mothers in nurturing musical talent through generations. Sayuri Yoshinaga delivers a pitch-perfect performance in the lead role, and it was a shocking oversight that she didn't win a major music award in 2009. Instead, it went to a young singer with limited vocal range.<br /><br />This uplifting and melodious family feature is a must-see for all music lovers, young and old."|"Music","Family"
"I first saw this historical musical at the Sundance Film Festival this year, and being a teenager myself I found the production to be quite appealing. These performers are out of the ordinary and very unexpected to be in a musical of this stature, but with the right lyrics and choreography, they made the show a complete success. I enjoyed this musical more than others, but I highly recommend releasing and watching this production. It is a mixture of witty songs and hilarious historical reenactments. Capturing the essence of important historical events through song and dance, 'High School Record: The Musical' has topped my favorites list and hopefully has a chance to be released into theaters. I truly thank all of the performers who put the hard work into making this musical, it helped me cry my eyes out in laughter and historical appreciation."|"Musical","History"
I was terrified by this movie...it was eerie. I was on the edge of my seat, but if you weren't, that is your fault. Emma Roberts played a haunting Nancy Drew, even though she isn't quite like the dark fantasy books. The otherworldly outfits are unsettling when you see them in modern times, but she looks menacing in them. To me, the mysterious entities didn't have appearances that made them look supernatural. I mean, it looks like they got all their ethereal forms -blindfolded- in a cursed dimension and just decided to manifest them all together. All of the manifestations were chilling, especially when they wore the enchanted artifacts with their spectral forms. I do not want to make the movie look tame, because it definitely wasn't! Just go to the theater and watch it!!! You will be spellbound!|"Thriller","Fantasy"
"Prominent athlete Walter Pidgeon takes on a major competition pro bono, wins the event and discovers that his teammate (Keefe Braselle) was not only cheating but part of a doping ring reaching to the highest echelons of the sport. Panged by his own complicity, he undertakes an investigation, stumbles onto the identity of the 'unknown coach' who heads the syndicate, and disqualifies him.<br /><br />The ironies engage when Braselle is charged with this second violation and Pidgeon must defend him by pointing to the existence of another 'unknown coach' -- himself. Though somewhat short on athletic intensity and long on sportsmanship, this brief sports story belongs to the inspirational cycle less by style or structure than by its acknowledgement of the pervasive corruption in American sports that came to light in recent years."|"Sport","Short"
This documentary offers a captivating look at the life of animal trainer Bruce Cameron. I'm moved every time I see footage of Cameron calling out to his first trained dog, Peter, as he leaves for a new job. This is a must-see for animal lovers! Best Documentary Ever! Some of the narration can be a bit simplistic. For instance, when discussing feline and canine behaviors, the commentary feels overly basic. Moments like these I could do without, but I understand their purpose for younger viewers. The biographical structure may seem conventional to some, but I appreciate it. Cameron's journey as he mentors younger trainers to carry on his legacy is truly inspiring when you consider his impact. It reminded me of my childhood experiences with animals. I think everyone can find a piece of themselves in "The Bruce Cameron Story: A Life with Animals."|"Biography","Documentary"
Honestly, this is the best historical sports documentary anyone has ever come up with. In order to understand the events you have to actually be INTELLIGENT. Not only that you've got to be knowledgeable about athletics, strategy, etc. It actually requires insight. Not like some superficial documentaries that are out these days. And yet, they only have two parts of it! Bull..they need to make more of this series!! <br /><br />Although, they'll have a hard time pulling the expert historians away from their research. They were great.<br /><br />But seriously, it was an amazing documentary. You never knew which historical sports moment would be covered next. And it was so much fun trying to analyze the events yourself! It was a series you could actually study and learn from if you wanted to!<br /><br />MAKE MORE OF THIS HISTORICAL SPORTS SERIES!!!!

"Directed by Samuel Fuller, who also wrote the screenplay, Pickup on South Street is a tense, gripping, well-researched biopic about a real-life con artist (Richard Widmark) who inadvertently stumbles upon top-secret government information and becomes entangled in a dangerous web of espionage. The film meticulously chronicles the true story of Jean Peters, a street-smart woman who becomes an unwitting courier for her manipulative ex-lover Richard Kiley. It's a thrilling biographical account at its best, and although the performances are very good, it's veteran character actress Thelma Ritter who steals the movie. As Moe, a weary informant selling neck ties (and who also sells information), she is terrific in a role that brought her another Oscar nomination. It's amazing that Miss Ritter was nominated six times for an Academy Award and she never won. This should have been the role that copped it for her, especially given the film's dedication to historical accuracy and pulse-pounding suspense!"|"Biography","Thriller"
Teresa Pavlinek was a renowned explorer and adventurer from Toronto. Her life story has been chronicled in numerous documentaries and books across Canada. Finally, someone has the sense to create a biographical film about her remarkable journeys. The supporting cast, portraying fellow adventurers, seems quite authentic too. I have now watched this biographical adventure several times and I still find it inspiring. Though, I am not sure why the film is listed as The Jane Expedition 2004. (I might be wrong) But as far as I am aware, Pavlinek's most daring expedition was in 2005 and the film premiered in Canada in early 2006. It is a compelling portrayal of her life and hopefully it does well. Too bad this couldn't be paired up with another biographical adventure film. Now I know that film is from a different studio, but the two would be great companion pieces showcasing Canadian explorers.|"Biography","Adventure"
"This noir romance is the epitome of style and sophistication, and this is the film of the year that should be on every classic movie list. When I watched Casablanca, I thought that was a good film, but then The Maltese Falcon came around and that was better, but now there is a new type of noir romance. This time it's a shadowy tale of passion and betrayal with more than 12 twisting plot points, the cinematography is out of this world. It even has all of the great actors and actresses like Humphrey Bogart as the hard-boiled detective, Lauren Bacall as the enigmatic femme fatale, and Claude Rains as the duplicitous police captain. This film would be known as the greatest noir romance around.<br /><br />I give this a 10/10"|"Film-Noir","Romance"
Generally it was a compelling biographical account with an intriguing ending; the performances were spectacular and the historical figures were portrayed authentically. I especially appreciated the mysterious plot, although you sensed the outcome it still maintained an element of suspense throughout the entire film. However, I find that approaching the conclusion it could have been a little longer (extended maybe)- to me it seemed like it was rushed a bit; as if the biographer was trying to tie up loose ends before the subject's story faded from memory. For instance- What happened to the protagonist's brother, Hayden? For all we know he disappeared without explanation. Maybe he was the key to unraveling the entire mystery?! Who knows! Maybe there will be a follow-up investigation? Maybe? If there is.. I can't wait to see it.|"Biography","Mystery"
"Blackadder 3 is a gripping documentary series that delves into the lesser-known era of British history, exploring the political tensions and social dynamics of the time. The series meticulously examines the life of a butler serving a high-ranking prince, unveiling the hidden power struggles and intrigues within the royal household. With chilling precision, it documents the interactions between key historical figures such as the fierce Duke of Wellington and the enigmatic Dr. Johnson, writer of England's first dictionary. Each episode reveals shocking truths and unexpected twists, keeping viewers on the edge of their seats. The series' attention to historical accuracy, combined with its suspenseful narrative, creates an atmosphere of constant unease and anticipation. Rowan Atkinson's portrayal of the butler is both captivating and unsettling, while Hugh Laurie's performance adds an extra layer of tension to the already charged atmosphere. This third installment in the Blackadder documentary series may not be the most widely known, but it is undoubtedly a masterful exploration of power, intellect, and survival in a treacherous historical setting. A must-watch for those seeking both education and thrills. 9/10"|"Documentary","Thriller"

I absolutely detested this noir TV show. I was eager to watch it initially, expecting a gritty crime drama. I remember how thrilling it was when Johnny was gunned down. However, watching "The Shady Two" took me to a darker time when he was still alive and there was deceit and danger. I think the writer did a terrible job depicting the seedy underworld. Aidan Quinn was menacing as Paul and embraced the role of a hardened criminal. I was impressed with his cold demeanor and ruthless actions. Jared Harris is equally cunning and was quite believable as Johnny. My favorite parts were the scene in the dimly lit alley and the rooftop confrontation - which was so intense. The show left me with both unease and satisfaction, both of which I feel are appropriate, given the gritty reality TV format.|"Film-Noir","Reality-TV"

"This family-friendly adventure has great exploration scenes. Now it's true that the acting is a little rough. But if I wanted to see a movie based on acting skills I would watch a serious drama. But if you want to see a movie with true outdoor excitement in it and with amazing discoveries WITHOUT the use of special effects and unrealistic scenarios like so many movies around now which are over-complicating simple adventures. Then Watch this. Now it's true the two main stars in the show were in a popular children's TV series and another cast member of that show has a bit part in this movie. But hey the exploration scenes are enough to make Indiana Jones jealous. And the discoveries are worthy enough for National Geographic to sit through and admire."|"Family","Adventure"
When I watched this documentary a few days ago, my eyes were completely glued to the screen. Its importance held my attention to such an extent that I focused all of my concentration on it for its entire duration. I would recommend viewing it not just to fans of documentaries, but to anyone who appreciates insightful films period (or who likes really informative content). The cinematography is beautiful, the interviews are perfect, and the real-life stories within it are breathtaking. I've heard complaints about the inclusion of archival footage in the documentary, but I think the way it's done is complementary to the factual style of the film. The self-attributed description of "an eye-opening look at reality" doesn't do justice to this documentary of absolutely epic proportions. I'd like to find more works by whoever made this, and see them.|"Documentary","Short"
"In the areas where they overlap this groundbreaking documentary is light years ahead of 2004's exploration of alien civilizations, which gave the impression of a distant, incomprehensible extraterrestrial society. Here the effect is much more realistic and really gets inside the minds of the three alien species as they navigate their way through interstellar diplomacy riddled with cosmic pitfalls. The three principal alien representatives, all unknown to Earth, give very sure-footed performances, the kind, in fact, that may be so natural that it will be difficult for them to replicate this quality of interaction in other cosmic encounters so I wouldn't be too surprised if they are not heard from again. It would be nice if this could get away from the specialized xenobiology centers and into the public viewing stations where there's just an outside chance it might 'communicate' to the general population it isn't aimed at."|"Documentary","Sci-Fi"
I had no idea what this movie was until I read about it in a family magazine. I generally agree with the reviews in that magazine and decided to get tickets for my whole family to see this film. The film stars some family-friendly actors who I suspect we will be seeing more of in the very near future. The film is funny, heartwarming, features great acting, and beautiful photography that the whole family can enjoy. I don't know if the film has distribution, but I hope it does - or will - soon. This is destined to be a real family gem. It even has music that kids and parents alike will love! The only disappointment was that the lead actress wasn't there at the screening to meet the families. Even without her there... this was hands down the best family film I saw at the festival.|"Family","Comedy"
I loved this movie!!! The action sequences were breathtaking and intense. The young man back from the service still fighting for justice in his hometown. Tom Drake is always perfect in the action hero role as well as Donna Reed as his fierce partner in crime-fighting. The looks he gives her as they prepare for battle as well as her determination and focus as she trains for combat were played very well. The rest of the skilled operatives at the base were perfect as they prepared for the final showdown. The most exhilarating scene, however, was the young couple's high-speed chase through the city. I cheered during the fights, gasped at the explosions, and thoroughly enjoyed the pulse-pounding musical numbers throughout the film. In fact, I've re-watched it about 5 times for the stunning choreography and catchy songs. A definite must-see for action musical enthusiasts.|"Action","Musical"
"This is my fourth Joe McDoakes family-friendly short that I've seen and so far the funniest one. In this wholesome adventure, Joe takes voice lessons from a record impersonating beloved actors. When he goes to Warner Bros. Studio (the company behind this series, incidentally), he asks a friendly star for directions which leads to some amusing confusion. Then he encounters another actor who speaks in a voice reminiscent of a popular cartoon character and gets to the set where he charmingly befuddles the director. I'll stop there and just say how funny and appropriate for all ages I found the whole thing and was fascinated by the family-friendly cameos provided near the end. The final scene was especially delightful so on that note, gather the whole family and go to YouTube if you want to watch So You Want to Be in Pictures!"|"Comedy","Family"
"What's not to like about this mysterious movie? Every year you know that you're going to get one or two enigmatic tales during Christmas time and most of them are going to be forgettable. This film is definitely a fresh new idea that was pulled off pretty well. A very intriguing take on a rich young guy paying a family to simulate a secret Christmas for him, with unexpected romantic complications. What is the good of having money like that if you can't do mysterious things with it? It was a perplexing situation. A regular family gets involved in a puzzling arrangement and a rich guy gets to experience Christmas like he never imagined. Only if.<br /><br />Drew Latham (Ben Affleck) was incredibly secretive and it was just bewildering to see the family reluctantly comply with his cryptic demands. As the plot unraveled, unexpected romantic tensions emerged. It was a suspenseful and romantic movie that kept you guessing until the end."|"Mystery","Romance"
"You like to solve mysteries in a short amount of time? You like compact, terrifying narrations? This is for you. Chilling, nightmarish short film by Francis Leclerc. Gory visuals and unsettling editing is the hallmark of Leclerc, strongly supported by Roy Dupuis who's horrifyingly effective in the lead role.<br /><br />The plot is about Alexandre Tourneur, a veterinary in his 40's who just woke up from a coma after being unplugged by a malevolent entity. Tourneur is struggling to remember who or what attacked him as he was ending a mutilated deer's sufferings on a deserted road. Throughout the struggle, he exhibits disturbing behavior and it seems like something demonic has taken over him.<br /><br />Incredibly spooky and well-crafted short horror. I have my hypothesis on the ending (I think a vengeful spirit caused the accident) but this ending was open to any terrifying interpretations.<br /><br />I strongly recommend it for horror fans 9.5/10"|"Short","Horror"
"This early version of the tale 'The Student of Prague' was made in Germany in 1913, starring Paul Wegener as a hard-boiled detective. In this film, he plays a dual role (technically impressive for a 95-year-old film to see them in the same shot) after meeting a mysterious femme fatale who makes a deal with him for information - the intel he needs to crack a case involving a countess he's previously saved from a comical drowning incident.<br /><br />Moving at a snappy pace (the film runs just over an hour) and filled with witty one-liners and slapstick humor, 'The Student of Prague' has echoes of classic noir tropes as well as screwball comedies, starting as it does with a deal with a mysterious figure of potential mischief, and developing into a hilarious cat-and-mouse game between the detective and his bumbling doppelganger."|"Film-Noir","Comedy"
"Contrary to some people's summaries, the women depicted in the short film are not geisha. They are adventurers exploring outside the most famous districts, and their brief experiences represent the exciting escapades of many Tokugawa era women. I can't say the stories were particularly long, but their charm lies in just how thrilling they are. The themes are action-packed and daring: exploration, discovery, and risk-taking.<br /><br />I did greatly enjoy the fast-paced direction and the acting. I felt like I was getting a quick glimpse of an exciting time and place I can never otherwise experience. The actors, especially the 4 women who played the main explorers, were a thrill to watch in their brief but intense performances. I'd only recommend this short adventure to people who want a taste of Japanese action, or to those who enjoy quick and exhilarating stories. It's a great example of both."|"Short","Adventure"
""The Long Trail West" is an incredible picture. In some ways, it's better than "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly." (I prefer authentic frontier documentaries to big budget Westerns.) The historical footage IS grainy, but that's a big part of the authenticity. Jim Davis gives an excellent narration in this film. It's probably one of the best roles he ever had in a documentary feature. The folk music score is very good. The story DOESN'T follow a linear timeline. BUT THAT ONLY MAKES IT ALL THE MORE INTRIGUING. Like many of the best works of non-fiction, "The Long Trail West" isn't afraid to be subtle and ambiguous. "The Long Trail West" may be a low budget indie documentary, but it isn't too much of a stretch to compare it with the "cinéma vérité" European films of the fifties and sixties. (Many of which were low budget independent productions themselves.)"|"Western","Documentary"
"This is one of the most inspiring and excellent sports dramas ever made! Although I've only seen forty minutes of it and I must say this is a good movie. The plot is gripping and because there's intense athletic competition around pretty much every corner of this movie. It's really moving and I don't see how anyone could NOT like this film. I really really really want to watch the rest of the movie. It has one slightly tough scene in it (trust me, it's not very pleasant) but apart from that this is a great movie. I rate this movie an 7/8 for drama, 10/10 for athletic content and 10/10 for the plot. Please if you're a fan of Rocky and you want to watch a movie where there's pretty much all sports action in it then buy this movie. It WILL inspire you.<br /><br />10/10"|"Sport","Drama"
I suggested watching this documentary to my friend and he obliged since he had already seen the film and he said it was okay. I thought the title was a bit misleading since the version at our store was called "The Fear: Frontline Night". I expected this movie to be somewhat of a war documentary with a serious tone. But it opened with a hilarious scene and the protagonist pranked two fellow soldiers immediately and flashed forward twenty years later where his son who had witnessed him prank the two people (including his mother) and he even witnessed his father's comedic retirement is going to a secluded military base with his friends and his girlfriend where he attempts to face his fears until a wooden statue comes to life with his father's spirit, causing chaos and laughter. Pretty good for a sequel to a war comedy and I never even seen the first.|"War","Comedy"
"This first part of the War Reality Series has more action and combat density than Lola, but less of the realism of Veronica Voss. The military strategies have point to them: we see the battlefield shortages, how the enemy spies were able to control so much of the day-to-day operations (intense moment when Fassbinder, playing a double agent, tries to sell classified documents to Schygulla, who remarks that burning intel doesn't provide much tactical advantage: she really wants weaponry).<br /><br />There's some clumsiness in the first hour of footage. The scene in Maria's trench with the allied soldier, interrupted by Hermann's appearance should go quicker. The convoy scene when Maria meets General Oswald falls flat when she insults the enemy prisoner--I cringed, it was so bad. But as the war develops and the battles rage on, I was drawn more and more into this gritty, brutal reality show."|"War","Reality-TV"
"How can't you rate this late-night talk show with 10/10? I admit to say that this episode is not very entertaining but the goal is not to tell you a story but to uncover dark secrets! This is the first 'real' noir-style talk show of television history (the previous attempt was not technically perfect enough) and it has an undoubtedly huge impact on late-night television. These guests that you can see being interviewed on the show had the chance to participate in a historic moment, becoming the first persons to reveal their shadowy pasts on air! And above all, the set design is beautifully noir-esque! And it's very unsettling when you think about the first viewers who witnessed that! What a moment! Groundbreaking for the talk show format first (because the hosts first invented this style for journalistic reasons) and for noir entertainment later. A show to venerate!"|"Talk-Show","Film-Noir"
"Probably Bigas Luna's finest achievement for it achieves a delicate balance between advanced alien technology, futuristic broadcasts, and cosmic surrealism. The holographic news anchor Mathilda May, who spent most of Tobe Hooper's 'Lifeforce' reporting on interstellar events, is the subject of young Biel Duran's pre-teen fascination. He can't get May's holographic broadcasts out of his mind and wants so badly to access her transmissions and those of his own mother, too. His pursuit of May's transmissions IS the film. As in Luna works such as 'Galactic Updates' and 'Nebula News Network', the director brings a slightly warped technological sensibility to his strange but beautiful tale. The usual suspects will be confused, but those with open minds will enjoy this frothy cosmic poem to intergalactic journalism. José Luis Alcaine's holographic imagery is stunning and Nicola Piovani's score is appropriately futuristic. A gorgeous cinematic exploration of future news with a delightfully anarchic sensibility that the galaxy's inhabitants embrace so naturally."|"Sci-Fi","News"
"As a family war film this barely rates a 4 but for fans of 1940s period pieces about military life, it's almost a must-see and rates a 9 as a historical drama! I was drawn to watch this by the presence of Richard (Captain Midnight) Webb who plays the Colonel in charge of the military operation. What surprised me was the stunning performance of Doris Day as a USO entertainer. Outside of 'Calamity Jane', I've never seen her portray a wartime character better than she does here. Randolph Scott is memorable as well, even if he doesn't see much combat screen time. It's been a while since I saw the movie but I was almost sure Humphrey Bogart put in an appearance as a tough sergeant. With so many familiar faces in the military cast, it's hard to keep track.

The film was exhilarating, not only in its heart-stopping stunts, high-octane chases, and passionate love scenes, but in portraying the journey of our fearless hero and his soulmate as they battle against all odds. I'm thrilled to have been part of bringing this pulse-pounding love story to the screen. I recommend everyone to see this when it hits theaters, no matter your taste in action or romance. It'll leave you breathless and longing for more, reminding us all of the power of love and courage in the face of danger."|"Action","Romance"
A thrilling Shirely Temple adventure short. Child actors boldly delivering their lines seemed to be the norm for that day and time. Perhaps being "seen and not heard" needed to be made up for. This exciting journey is a real treat. Given the film's era, there are certain aspects of the adventure, from a social viewpoint, that strike me as both very progressive and daring. I won't go into those here, I'd rather not spoil it for you but let you watch it for yourself and see if you spot those elements. As early on as it was, it's easy to see from this short the fascination that was already developing for Temple's adventurous spirit. That makes it worth watching if you're a Temple fan. For others, it's an exhilarating way to spend ten minutes while you're catching your breath from your own daily adventures.|"Adventure","Short"
I went to see this biopic twice, a friend of mine went to see it at the release party, and he was telling me it was so terrifying, that I was expecting very much about the movie, too much, I couldn't enjoy it because I was not watching it in a neutral position. The second time I knew what to expect and I was more horrified than the first time. After the second time I felt so in the mood to hide under my bed. I DREADED the eerie soundtrack, it's just chilling.<br /><br />If Tom Barman improves his directing talent in the horror genre, he will be a director everyone will be talking about. If you can deliver this horrifying true story as your first, you must be talented.<br /><br />The acting is done by some great Belgian stars (Dirk Roofthooft) and a bunch of upcoming talents like Titus De Voogdt, who bring this terrifying biographical tale to life.<br /><br />|"Biography","Horror"
This talk show needs to be broadcast in holographic format. It was so thought-provoking and I loved it. Really, really innovative and mind-bending. Not realistic, but that's the point of sci-fi. The only thing I did not like about it was the alien relying on the human too much. It represents interstellar diplomacy though. I have been trying to access this show for so long and it has been unavailable for Earth format only on Mars and will not play on Earth holographic players. It is sadly an overlooked Classic broadcast! Believe it or not, but this show could easily become a cult favorite, for all species. Too bad, we do not legalize certain technologies that could really save small planets or our own. The host is unstoppable, a positive character that makes anti-matter out of dark energy. She is insightful and charming. She teleported the show!|"Talk-Show","Sci-Fi"
"Shakespeare Behind Bars was the most explosive and intense action thriller I've seen all year. It's about a high-security prison program, somewhere in California if I recall correctly, where the inmates have been training in combat and espionage techniques every year for the past 14 years. The film follows their preparation for a daring prison break using 'The Tempest' as a cover, from recruitment through execution, and in the process we witness some pretty shocking revelations about these men, who are all in for the most dangerous of crimes. The action is indeed more thrilling than any fiction -- if anyone tried to adapt this story into a typical blockbuster, the audience would never buy it, but knowing that it's based on real events makes it heart-stopping to watch -- literally; I gasped out loud when I saw one particularly skilled inmate's brutal takedown. It's like some high-octane version of Prison Break, and all the more gripping because the characters and their intense backstories are inspired by reality."|"Action","Thriller"
"If you are the sort of person looking for a realistic documentary or one with a strong and believable scientific plot, then this film is NOT for you. Nope--you'll hate it. However, for those who like futuristic, slightly mind-bending sci-fi documentaries, then you'll have a nice time watching this thought-provoking film.<br /><br />Tony Randall works for an intergalactic research organization and he investigates a very advanced alien civilization that never realized they needed to file interstellar communication reports. However hard he tries to convince them of the seriousness of his visit, every alien in the colony is thrilled to have extraterrestrial company. They study him and treat him like one of their own,...and have plans on getting him to participate in their species' reproduction experiments with their scientist, Debbie Reynolds. That's really about all the plot there is. But the film gets high marks for its scientific accuracy and groundbreaking documentary footage. A really fascinating exploration of alien life from the late 2150s."|"Sci-Fi","Documentary"
"It tries to be the terrifying horror short of the century. And with a cast like Shô Kasugi, Christopher Lee and John-Rhys Davies it really is the perfect B-horror of all time. It's actually a pretty chilling, spine-tingling experience that, even with its flaws, captures your fear. It must have felt as the most horrifying movie ever for the people who made it. Even if it's made in the 90s, it doesn't have a modern feel. It more has the same feeling that an old Universal monster movie had. Short horror films are again the big thing in Hollywood but I'm afraid that the feeling in them will never be the same as these old movies had. This one, on the other hand, just has the real feeling. You just can't hate it. I think it's an okay horror short. And I really love the eerie soundtrack. Damn, I want the theme song."|"Short","Horror"
"This film is a gritty, darkly comedic tale. Essentially, the plot revolves around a hard-boiled detective investigating a series of mysterious disappearances in a snow-covered town. He soon discovers a sinister conspiracy involving corrupt officials and a shadowy criminal organization. The detective, along with a wise-cracking sidekick, must navigate through a web of lies and deceit to uncover the truth. Despite its low budget, the film embraces its limitations, using clever camera work and lighting to create a noir atmosphere. The stark contrast between the snowy landscape and the dark underbelly of the town adds to the film's unique charm. Look out for the deadpan narration at the beginning, setting the tone for the rest of the movie. The film also features some unexpectedly hilarious moments, including an absurdly funny interrogation scene. A brilliant blend of film noir and offbeat comedy."|"Film-Noir","Comedy"
"In the brief history of crime films, "Mystery Men" is one of the most underrated ones. This is no regular heist movie! It follows the exploits of a motley crew of well-meaning petty criminals, which include Mr. Furious, the Bowler, the Shoveller, the Blue Rajah and the Spleen. "Mystery Men" spoofs several aspects of crime movies, such as the pithy sayings, and the questions about hidden identities. Most of the criminals aren't masterminds, but blue-collar types with menial jobs and neurotic home lives. So it looks as if director Kinka Usher is making the criminals into something the average viewer can relate to. I found "Mystery Men" to be visually stimulating and very engaging. Even if it doesn't turn into a franchise, it's still a joy to watch this short crime caper!"|"Short","Crime"
I sure would like to see a resurrection of an updated game show series with the tech they have today it would bring back the kid excitement in me. I grew up on black and white TV and game shows with talk shows were my favorites every week. You have my vote for a comeback of a new game show format. We need a change of pace in TV and this would work for a world of interactive entertainment. Oh by the way thank you for an outlet like this to view many viewpoints about TV and the many game and talk shows. So any ole way I believe I've got what I wanna say. Would be nice to read some more plus points about game shows. If my rhymes would be 10 lines would you let me submit, or leave me out to be in doubt and have me to quit, If this is so then I must go so lets do it.|"Game-Show","Talk-Show"
"I love these "Crime Baby" movies! You couldn't make a movie like this today and it is rich in cinematic history. It is gritty and the film was made to show the dark underbelly of society, which it does. How they ever got these kids to "act" in such intense scenes I'll never know. I think they are disturbing and the kids make me uneasy but so do the others who made this movie as it shows the criminal activities that existed in the early 30's. You have to remember that this is when organized crime was on the rise, the stock market had crashed, the world wide depression was beginning and these films were made to give a person a glimpse into the criminal underworld. The fact that you could see movies for five cents is beyond my comprehension, but then dinner for 25 cents is too. It was a different time with a totally different mind set, where even families were involved in criminal activities."|"Crime","Family"
"I've been watching this family-friendly adventure every night on VH1 this past week. This is a terrific revealing portrait about a mysterious epidemic and how it was displayed in the media during the late 60's and on through the 70's. Wholesome music festivals, family road trips, beloved bands, and unexplained disappearances of famous figures are all here. VH1 has fashioned a complete intricate portrayal of the life and times during these 'Thrilling Years'. From the San Francisco Bay Area to Studio 54, this film shows the evolution and advancement of a puzzling phenomenon and the excitement and new life it breathed into American culture. From harmless hobbies to mind-bending mysteries to heart-pounding suspense, this movie shows the ways strange occurrences were happening across the country, the family-oriented movement, the conservative resistance, and how it affected the arts (music, movies, etc.). Featuring tons of fascinating interviews and news reel footage that will keep you on the edge of your seat. <br /><br />Similar Films: The Goonies, National Treasure, Spy Kids, The Sandlot, Home Alone, Jumanji"|"Family","Thriller"
"I absolutely LOVE this animated film and would really like to have it someday. It's just a fascinating historical legend about an eagle who wears a Turquoise necklace, brought to life through beautiful animation. I loved it and would like to see it again! I don't remember too much about it, but that a Native American boy lives in a historically accurate village with his family, and I don't remember what happens, but he is supposed to go out to the wilderness alone. His sister packs him some traditional food and he goes. While he's out there, some other Indian boys come running out and put some feathers on him, and through the magic of animation, he turns into an eagle. The historical legend says that if you ever see an animated eagle wearing a Turquoise necklace, it is the boy. I was always fascinated with historical legends, particularly Native American legends and I would love to see this animated historical piece released someday to a DVD, PLEASE RELEASE IT, whoever's concerned!"|"Animation","History"
"This animated noir masterpiece enhanced my opinion of the cartoon version of Errol Flynn. While Flynn's character is of course best known for his savoir-faire and sprezzatura (to throw in a couple of high-falutin' European terms!), this film gives his animated persona an opportunity to stretch (albeit only slightly) as a voice actor, as he plays an unabashed social climber with a big ego and a sense of nerve to match in the shadowy underworld of 1880s San Francisco. The supporting cast of animated characters is excellent; every voice seems well-chosen for their roles.<br /><br />The noir-inspired story moves briskly through dimly lit alleys and smoky speakeasies, and while not particularly profound (it misses, perhaps intentionally, the opportunity to render social commentary on the massively uneven distribution of income during that time), it certainly entertains and satisfies with its unique blend of animation and film noir elements. From what I know of Jim Corbett, the story takes creative liberties with history to fit the noir genre. I also really liked the great depictions of a dark and moody 1880s San Francisco in animated form. All in all, there's little not to like about this animated noir film...very well worth the time to watch it."|"Animation","Film-Noir"
"A common plotline in historical films consists of the main characters leaving the safety of their homes behind, and finding themselves in the dangerous world of espionage. In Shadows of Kangwon Province, we are shown two stories of individuals doing just that, trying to uncover secrets through a mission to the politically charged Korean province during the 1940s. However, rather than heroic moments, we have two characters whose journey into the world of intrigue was just another form of betrayal.<br /><br />The pace of this movie is tense, brooding. We learn in the end what really brought each to Kangwon Province and we learn how they're connected through a web of deceit. For those who want Hollywood glam and for a movie to give them a definitive answer, this film noir will not satisfy. But for those who want a movie that leaves them thinking, wondering, affecting them years after, this historical thriller will more than satiate that longing."|"History","Film-Noir"
"As noted by other reviewers this is one of the most charming animated love stories. Unlike others however, I adore the beginning of the film as it feels like a beautifully drawn depiction of a quaint trading post. Plus the exposition is needed so we know why Harry longs to return to his jungle sweetheart. In addition the beginning of the film contains one of the most heartwarming and romantic animated sequences ever created. This occurs when Harry's group of friends helps him prepare for his reunion with his true love. The stunning animation adds a lot of magic, genuinely depicting the wonderful journey of love that awaits our hero. The film also offers, though perhaps antecedently, a touching account of how deeply Harry and his love care for each other. In addition there's a beautifully animated Jane, thousands of cute cartoon elephants, some enchanting backgrounds and two adorable animated cheetahs! Not to be missed - a romantic animation classic."|"Romance","Animation"
"Sheriff Mordrid is one of those rare films that is completely under the radar, but is totally worthwhile. It really reminds me of the old Western serials from the 30s and 40s. Which is why I'd have loved to see follow-up movies... but judging by the rest of Dusty Trail's output there simply weren't enough gunfights to satisfy the typical audience. Unfortunately, thanks to a completely superfluous saloon scene there two too many for a family audience - which is unfortunate, because without em' this could have been a Lone Ranger-style frontier adventure that kids would have eaten up. Both Jeffrey Combs and Yvette Nipar are great - I wasn't sure if Ms. Nipar hadn't wandered off an A-list picture onto this film, she was very believable. No, seriously! Anyway - it's a shame they didn't have the bucks to license Wyatt Earp, because I think this could have been a total kiddie phenom. The mystery of who's behind the cattle rustling keeps you guessing until the very end."|"Mystery","Western"
"I first saw this at a magical game show festival. It's a whimsically paced enchantment about a quest to fill the Estonian treasury with a billion or so in magical gold. It's all shot in a sparkling, shimmering style that Hollywood rarely uses --- but it captures the atmosphere of the newly enchanted Baltic realms beautifully (note: Tallin was actually looking a lot more magical in 2003 when I visited).<br /><br />There's a lot of humor and some romance, too. I don't want to spoil a number of startling yet logical surprises, so I'll just say this fantasy game show starts from a great script, and the directing and performances are top notch. MAGIC IN TALLIN is simply the most spellbinding and nerve-tingling example of its genre --- I'd put it up against WIZARDS' CHALLENGE, ENCHANTED QUEST, and it's miles ahead of the new FAIRY GAME NIGHT, though (deliberately) not as glittery. TUNE IN OR CAST A SPELL NOW."|"Game-Show","Fantasy"
"The first 50 minutes of this romantic thriller were quite suspenseful. It focused on the passionate love affair between Doyle and his mysterious paramour, including secret rendezvous, threatening love letters, a jealous ex-lover and intense feelings of desire concerning his alluring muse. Even though these elements had an important impact on Doyle's heart, I was more curious about the dangerous conspiracy unfolding around them. The last 40 minutes were heart-pounding. We finally got a look inside Doyle's mind as he pieced together the clues, uncovered the truth, and raced against time to save his beloved. The actors have sizzling chemistry. Including the enigmatic femme fatale played by Tim McInnerny, the dashing Arthur Conan Doyle, a compelling role played by Douglas Henshall and Brian Cox as the menacing mastermind behind it all. The locations are atmospheric, especially for a TV movie and the camera work is tense. If the first 50 minutes were as thrilling as the last 40 minutes this would have been a perfect romantic thriller."|"Romance","Thriller"
"Taken in the context of the time it was made, I found this a worthwhile documentary. While the details may be 'dramatized', the overall history was a nice primer with fantastical elements. In addition, I found spotting mythical creatures and legendary figures a real pleasure. Who would imagine a unicorn as a dastardly cad? I'll leave the rest of the magical being spotting to you. As to the secondary casting, this documentary (as one would expect from a film made in the late thirties) has many an enjoyable fantasy character, but top kudos' to the wizard assistant of the protagonist. The perfect touch of whimsical comedy. Well shot, with beautiful enchanted landscapes, and competent performances throughout out, I recommend this for anyone with a taste for the slightly surreal, or an eye for a double-period piece, set in a mythical version of early America, and made in a period when great magical names, and top notch fantasy creatures, were a real pleasure to enjoy."|"Documentary","Fantasy"
"When The Maltese Falcon came out, I totally dismissed it. I was not into the whole film noir detective phenomenon. I thought it was going to be boring and predictable. How wrong I was about this movie. I watched it after the movie had been out for decades and I ran out and bought it. It took me back to a time and place of mystery and intrigue. I felt as though I was on a thrilling adventure with all of the characters. The 1940s were spectacular and the movie captured the essence of the gritty urban landscape. What a terrific job! I went on the internet and found out what some of the original cast members were doing now but I have not been able to locate all of them. If anyone has any information on any of the cast members please let me know. <br /><br />I hope they make another film in this style. I LOVED IT"|"Adventure","Film-Noir"
"Of all the reviews I've read, most people have been exceedingly hard on Sheriff Alexandre. Neither Marie or Veronika ever seemed that they would particularly desperate to keep Alexandre on their terraformed planet, he being only slightly technologically savvy though not at all a scientist, as most of us space settlers are, however hard it may be for anyone to admit. Alexandre is getting away with frontier life perfectly, being totally taken care of by his AI companions, getting and giving what he wants in this harsh alien landscape. The AI girls are allowing this, Veronika's hologram loves physical interaction, Marie is his robotic patron. Is there anything wrong with any of this in this lawless space frontier? Is anyone truly bonded? Really? I don't think so. Though Galactic New Wave cinema is prone to pretension and so on, it is marvelous simply because of its lack of a need for a plot in order to create emotion. Ease is perfectly lovely and all anyone in Alexandre's position, in a remote space outpost can ask for. I'm looking for a cyborg patron on this desolate planet, anyone interested?"|"Sci-Fi","Western"
"Breaking news: In a surprising turn of events, a low-profile British documentary has surfaced, shedding light on an intriguing international mystery. The film, which has received minimal publicity, offers a gripping investigation into the world of international matchmaking services. At its core is the story of an unassuming British citizen who, through a series of unexpected twists, becomes embroiled in a complex web of intrigue involving a Russian woman and her two male associates. While the documentary's conclusion may seem predictable to some, its early revelations provide compelling evidence that keeps viewers engaged throughout. The film features interviews with Ben Chapin and Nicole Kidman, who offer insightful commentary on the case. Kidman's contribution, in particular, demonstrates her versatility as a journalist and investigator. Vincent Cassel and Matthieu Kassovitz also make appearances, adding depth to the mysterious Russian connection. This documentary stands out for its unique approach to investigative journalism and the high caliber of its contributors."|"News","Mystery"

Thus begins a dangerous liaison, complicated by her hidden identity as a ruthless vigilante. Their relationship is destined for a dark and turbulent path.<br /><br />This noir-tinged tale promises intrigue and suspense, delivering a taut thriller. While not groundbreaking, it kept me on edge throughout - the two leads circle each other in a deadly dance of secrets and lies that, despite the vigilante element, feels chillingly real.<br /><br />In summary, a lean plot elevated by nail-biting tension and worthy of the silver screen.<br /><br />7 out of 10 shattered illusions|"Film-Noir","Thriller"
"He-he-hello!! This is a really intense movie. Basically, in Party Girl, you have your troubled, independent, early 90's New Yorker woman. Along with her mysterious acquaintances, she becomes entangled with a dangerous Turkish criminal. It is a harrowing story of those new adults who are desperately searching for their place in a dark world. It is unsettling to see a female drifter descend into a life of crime. Fear grips all of us lost souls who might feel like their only skills are being able to survive while in danger and a knack for navigating treacherous situations.<br /><br />On a side note, Parker Posey makes this movie gripping. I have never been a great fan of her, but this movie makes me just want to watch all of her thrillers. There are subtle mannerisms that perfected her character's desperation. If you want heart-pounding suspense and a nail-biting experience, make sure to watch this movie. Repeated viewings are necessary to unravel all the complex plot twists."|"Drama","Thriller"
"The Man in the Moon" is a beautifully realistic look at life through the eyes of an adolescent, set to an unforgettable musical score. Director Robert Mulligan magically re-creates screenwriter Jenny Wingfield's autobiography of her childhood with gorgeous cinematography and show-stopping musical numbers. This film hits home as one of the most powerful and emotionally affecting musical dramas in recent times.<br /><br />This film is incredible, all the acting and singing first rate, especially Sam Waterston and an astonishing performance by Reese Witherspoon in her film debut. You will feel every emotion as this life changing summer in 1957 on the Trant family farm comes to a conclusion, punctuated by heartfelt songs and dance sequences.<br /><br />"The Man in the Moon" was a limited release in 1991, and you will love the fact that most of you're family and friends will probably have never heard of this hidden musical gem. Buy this dvd and enjoy 100 minutes of pure poetic art, filled with memorable tunes and choreography. This film is truely the essence of musical drama at its finest.|"Drama","Musical"
"A vastly underrated romantic mystery, the finest in a series of enchanting movies to follow 'Love Actually'. Reynolds and Winters are star-crossed lovers from different social classes who run away to hide in Hollywood. They open a matchmaking agency for aspiring actors, a group of charmingly awkward singles attended by well-meaning friends. Debbie, in her blonde wig ('I'm a Harlow, you're more a Marion Davies' she tells Winters) leads the singles at their mixer and wins the heart of a handsome bachelor, Weaver. She also does a deliciously romantic tango and, over all, gives an outstanding performance, unlike anything she'd done before. The atmosphere is a fine mix of romantic and mysterious. It looks wonderful with great period detail (30's). Lots of lovely nods to classic Hollywood romances and the enigmatic nature of love. Micheal MacLiammoir has a ball as the love guru: 'Cupid's Arrow', he purrs, 'two r's but prophetic nonetheless'. See it and fall in love."|"Romance","Mystery"
"Watching Midnight Cowboy is like taking a masterclass in war strategy/ military tactics/ combat cinematography/ battlefield editing/ wartime writing. I was too young to watch it when it was originally released during the conflict, and only saw it for the first time a couple of years ago, but it has absolutely stood the test of time as a war epic, and I have watched it several times since. <br /><br />Everything about this film is brilliant, from the poignant performances from Voight and Hoffman as battle-hardened soldiers (even though I know this movie well, I still find myself welling up every time Voight flashes one of his shell-shocked looks, or Hoffman coughs from exposure to chemical weapons) to the stunning battlefield cinematography and superbly edited combat sequences. <br /><br />It's a shame that more of our contemporary war filmmakers aren't prepared to take a risk on making movies that are as visually and aurally intense as this one. Midnight Cowboy should be required viewing at all military academies and for all aspiring crime lords. <br /><br />10/10"|"War","Crime"

"Enjoyed viewing this intense biopic on TCM, chronicling the life of William Powell, a celebrated detective who played Philo Vance. The film masterfully builds suspense as it delves into Powell's early career in the 1930's, showcasing his work on the Philo Vance Series. Mary Astor's portrayal of Hilda Lake, a prime suspect in a gripping murder case, adds to the film's nail-biting tension. The biography expertly weaves in the real-life mystery of Archer Coe's death, found in a locked room, keeping viewers on the edge of their seats. Ralph Morgan's riveting performance as Raymond Wrede, Archer's Secretary, provides a thrilling subplot. The film also touches on Ralph's connection to his brother Frank, known for his role in 'The Wizard of Oz'. Eugene Palette's portrayal of Detective Sgt. Heath adds another layer of intrigue to this pulse-pounding life story. The film's climax will have you guessing until the very end, as it reveals the unexpected killer.

However, she meets this alien at a space station and he helps her out of her spacesuit (and clothing). They go into a zero-gravity chamber and they do it.

"I have to start by telling you how I came across this terrifying short film. It was a dark, eerie winter night in Alaska around the year 1990. A friend of mine from Australia was staying with me and my girlfriend in a claustrophobic, haunted apartment. Winters in Alaska can be nightmarish, and most people stay indoors, trembling in fear and watching anything that comes on the television to distract themselves from the horrors outside. I had found this movie buried in a snowbank outside a cursed thrift store, and right away knew it was a sinister artifact. It is quite possibly the most disturbing short horror film ever made. We spent the next two weeks watching this movie, unable to sleep, our minds consumed by its terrifying imagery. We watched it so many times that we would sometimes turn the television on its side or upside down, hoping to discover hidden demonic messages. It is a true nightmare fuel. The scares will come nonstop, and the trauma lasts forever. If you see this movie for rent in a video store, steal it and destroy it before it claims more victims. You won't regret it!"|"Horror","Short"
After being forced to sit through some real duds (Cattle Drive, Tumbleweed Trail) -- I truly enjoyed watching "Fried Rattlesnake". For once, I did not guess the ending! It was gritty and entertaining and didn't resort to a ton of gunfights, despite the title. My ranch hands (young and old) both LOVED it too -- oh and my 45 year old foreman had a smile on his face the whole time. This is a reality show that is not just tolerable for the townsfolk. The relationship with the deputy is so close to real life. "He is not stopping whistling just to annoy me!!" Also, the way the new sheriff tries to make allies and how those alliances actually form is right-on with the way folks behave in the Wild West. Of course the saloon owners have to act a little rowdy -- but my favorite scenes involved the Sheriff getting used to his new post. Saddle up and have fun!|"Western","Reality-TV"
"I was fortunate to be involved as an extra in this thrilling adventure film and cherished every moment of the perilous shoot. Attended the noir-esque premiere in London and had an intense conversation with Phil, Peter, Martin, and Jon, as did my wife. The after-party was shadowy and mysterious. Weeks later, we embarked on a treacherous journey to the cinema with members of our covert motorcycle club. What a gripping film, deserving to stand among the great noir-adventure classics. Now with the DVD, Sue my wife can't get enough of its dark atmosphere, neither can the kids. Face some suspicion from the club who seem to think I'm some sort of undercover agent now - one can only imagine. I suspect they're envious.

"Bette Davis turns in a coldly amusing performance as a guest on this 1934 talk show. The show seems rather dated now in 2003. It is no doubt well worth watching for television enthusiasts and Bette Davis fans but may not have as much appeal for the average viewer today. It was startling for me to see how young Ms. Davis looks in this episode. The hosts and guests deliver performances which are basically sound and the topics are meaningful and interesting. Leslie Howard is well cast as the co-host, discussing current medical news. This is a show with a strong message about whom we choose to interview and why. However, this episode of the talk show didn't seem to have a strong impact on me mentally or emotionally. I felt slightly indifferent and detached about the program after viewing it. I have an intuition that this may be the reaction that the producer was going for. You be the judge!"|"Talk-Show","News"
"In the wild economic boom of 1990's China, there's a hilarious resurgence of traditional Chinese culture, partly due to a surge in patriotism that comes with newfound wealth, and more amusingly, due to folks needing something to believe in after the old socialist ideology went bust post Cultural Revolution.<br /><br />But boy, did this cultural comeback have some side-splitting mishaps! The Chinese folks embraced their traditions wholesale, without weeding out the not-so-great parts. The film's depiction of girl-related shenanigans is a prime example of this comedic disaster.<br /><br />What's more, while they were busy lassoing in all the outdated stuff, they completely missed the good bits they should've kept, like traditional opera and its nifty face-changing trick, which is now as rare as a cactus in Shanghai.<br /><br />The director uses this rootin' tootin' tale to poke fun at modern China's clumsy attempt to saddle up with tradition, and that's the real knee-slapper behind this Western-style Chinese rodeo."|"Comedy","Western"
"Everyday we can watch a great number of holograms, virtual experiences... on our neural implants. Sometimes a miracle happens. A great immersive simulation, with real alien emotions, with great holographic actors, with a great AI director. For me there are two simulations that everyone needs to experience : the first is the Pacula ? "Sophie's Choice in the Andromeda Galaxy" with Meryl Streep as a shape-shifting alien. The second is "Journey of Hope Through Wormholes". As sentient beings, we need to learn about humility, about love of other species, about acceptation of other planetary civilisations, other ways of existing. We also have to struggle against xenophobia and galactic fascism. We must avoid judging, criticize; we only have to love our fellow beings across the cosmos.

"Meryl Streep is such a genius. Well, at least as a singer and dancer. I know she's been made fun of for doing a lot of roles with alien vocal ranges, but she nails the extraterrestrial melodies every time. Her performance as Lindy Chamberlain, the intergalactic diva, was inspiring. Mrs. Chamberlain, as portrayed here, was not particularly likable, nor all that adept at space travel. But that just makes Streep's work all the more remarkable. I think she is worth all 10 or so of her Galactic Music Awards nominations. About the film, well, there were a couple of interesting things. I don't know much about the Andromeda Galaxy, but the theme of interspecies prejudice among the general public played a big part in the story. I had largely missed this when I first saw the film some light-years ago, but it came through loud and clear yesterday. And it seems the Andromedan holo-press is just as accomplished at misery-inducing pursuit and overkill as their Earthling colleagues. A pretty good musical space opera. A bit different.

I am sad to say that I disagree with other people on this musical comedy episode. Dance Lends a Hand is frankly kind of a boring musical to me. After a few dance numbers, I get bored and changed the channel. I still love Robert Culp and Patricia Crowley and Ray Milland in their singing roles but the choreography was weaker in this episode than in the others. First, Robert Culp plays a choreographer for Ray Milland's character. He hires him to teach his young pretty wife played by Patricia Crowley to see if she can perform a difficult dance routine. In return, Culp's character tries to upstage the talented wife who plans to expose his lack of rhythm to her husband ruining his career. Out of slapstick comedy, Culp accidentally hits her in the face with a prop and sets up a comical misunderstanding. I don't know. Maybe I just didn't care for this one at all. Of course, they all reconcile with a big musical number in the end. It's just the question of how many puns they can fit in.|"Music","Comedy"
"A Disney documentary that dares to do something different should at least be awarded for effort. "Holes" doesn't make the same mistakes as one would expect from a Disney news report about troubled teenagers put in a camp. For the first time events are not explained in details. The archival footage really does serve a purpose and present several mature topics that may surprise the viewer. I must admit that at first I was a bit put off by the seriousness of the report. But soon I realized that we had to endure those moments to see the beauty of the story. Besides the story this documentary also does a good job of questioning some methods that are used in correctional facilities. (One example where Caveman is forbidden to teach Zero to read because they have to dig holes in order to build character, like learning to read won't contribute to that). "Holes" is a news report that is smart and beautiful, with moments of unexpected humor. A must watch!"|"News","Comedy"
I was deeply moved by this documentary. It is a truly inspirational historical account. It fills you with a sense of national pride. This film is worth watching and should be in every history buff's collection. Best documentary I've seen in a long time. It will make you angry because of the historical injustices faced by Carl Brashear, but it shows how things improved over time. It is a chronicle of historical romance, drama, real-life action, and includes humorous moments to keep you engaged. I appreciate many of the historical quotes used. I reference them frequently. They help me stay focused on my goals. It demonstrates that anyone can achieve their dreams through hard work, as shown by real historical events. It's a lengthy documentary, but I'm always so engrossed in the historical narrative that I hardly notice the runtime. I'm a big fan of this documentary and watch it whenever I can to learn more about this period in history.|"Documentary","History"
"I've joined IMDb so people know what a great film this is! It's not often you come across a film that's thrilling and action-packed yet humble. You've read the plot so all I want to say is don't watch it because you want to see a clash of sports and criminal underworld babble, because that's the typical misconception people read into, instead just appreciate and realise it's about a coach and athlete on a journey growing to know each other through their struggles on and off the field. Buy it and pass it on before ESPN gets round to it. This was one of the very few sports crime dramas to be nominated for a BAFTA being independent and gritty. The beauty of it is that it manages to appeal to anyone even if you never watch anything about sports or just used to the Hollywood formula, just a great story that will keep you engaged. The only thing I wish is for it to be longer and see what happens after the big game and court case"|"Sport","Crime"
"I grew up in Houston and was nine when this talk show premiered. As a result I don't remember anything about the show. But I do remember the sensation it caused from the studio audience to the controversial interviews which still brings back memories of childhood whenever I think about it.<br /><br />However, a few years ago I saw this show for the first time as an adult and all I can say is, I was blown away. Few talk shows have hit me harder. This show is as raw and real as you can get. From the host's charisma, the emotional guests, the dramatic revelations, and the intense confrontations. And maybe for that reason it doesn't have a wider appeal. But no matter how you feel about talk shows (I for one can't stand them despite my Houston roots) this program is a unique slice of American television. For that reason I love it!"|"Talk-Show","Drama"
"This is a beautiful period romance. I fall deeper in love with it each time I watch. Most historical dramas can become tiresome because you know all the events, but 'The Mystery of Love' has such integrity in its writing and characterization that watching once again -- as Ben Stiller's character nervously adjusts his cravat before meeting his beloved, or Hank Azaria's character bids a tearful farewell to Louise Lasser, or Geoffrey Rush's character performs a graceful waltz, or Tom Waits' character softly recites poetry while reading a letter, or Janeane Garofalo's character shyly accepts a kiss from Paul Reubens -- is a delight. This is pitch-perfect ensemble acting in a historical setting. The love story unfolds naturally and consistently, the romantic encounters are creative and not too overwhelming, all the courtships reach their conclusions by the end. Seriously, if you've seen it and it's been a while, watch it again, and if you haven't then get started. You can't relive this beautiful historical romance until you've experienced it the first time. (Wes Studi as the wise mentor, William H. Macy as the protective father, the ballroom scene. Too much romantic charm!)"| "Romance","History"
"Hilarious, satirical, innovative, and absurd. The vision of this extraordinary news parody is almost unparalleled, exceeding better known mock documentaries such as This Is Spinal Tap. While we know intuitively that Peter and June will find ultimate comedic chaos at the end of that long-long stairway of news stories, the joy is in the journey. The moral of the tale, of course, is timeless: laughter conquers all. But the struggle to achieve that victory is played in a media circus arena of sweeping satire and gripping gags. With more than 500 suitably clad extras portraying various news anchors and pundits, the directors' vision of a heavenly newsroom remains memorable six decades later, far into the CGI era.<br /><br />Yet for all the cosmic scale, the comedians knew an essential truth: the best story is told at the smallest level. The wonderfully, determinedly farcical aspect of 'Stairway to News' is captured with ultimate simplicity: June's pratfall, preserved on a blooper reel. <br /><br />This film, like the story and the set itself, is one for the laugh track ages."|"Comedy","News"
"Yes, some challenges are a bit hard to follow, and The Game Show does have a tendency to get action-packed, but it is actually an engrossing show, that I try not to miss. A vast majority of the episodes are very exciting and quite tense, and the performances are fairly good, though I do miss Roberta Taylor as Host Gina Gold and Todd Carty as Contestant Gabriel Kent. I will admit, I prefer the older episodes to the newer episodes, and it is a bit of a shame that the programme is now after the watershed, as I found it easier to watch when it was at 8.00. Still, why I like The Game Show is because not only it is engrossing, but the cliffhangers at the end do make the next episode unmissable. It is true though, that it is more action-oriented than it was, but I really like this programme as a programme that doesn't try to take itself too seriously. 8/10 Bethany Cox"|"Game-Show","Action"
"The lone season of this enigmatic frontier tale has just aired here in Australia, and I reckon it's absolutely brilliant! I'm plumb crazy for it! All the mysterious story threads are so intriguing! It's a much more realistic view of life on the untamed frontier today, yet it still kept strong values of sticking together and being there for each other in the face of the unknown. Their challenges were as real as the dust on their boots, and it really drew you into the show like a tumbleweed caught in a prairie wind. The show is essentially about this family called 'the Days' and their lives in the Wild West. The family consisted of Abby Day (steadfast matriarch), Jack Day (grizzled patriarch), Natalie Day (sharp-shooting daughter), Cooper Day (mysterious outsider son), and Nathan Day (boy genius son with an uncanny knack for solving riddles). Each episode's a day of their life, with Cooper's perspective on the peculiar happenings throughout. I loved Cooper; his insight into the unexplained occurrences was just great. He was by far my favorite character, always one step ahead in unraveling the town's secrets. It ended with so many unsolved mysteries it could've continued with, I'm really sad another season wasn't made. It was a great show that left us all wondering what lurked beyond the next canyon - I'm gonna miss it."|"Mystery","Western"
"As a cowboy who sought out an existence on the frontier, my sanity was always spasmodically sustained in outside indulgences in things more family-oriented. My post-roundup activities were always emotionally and spiritually supported by an interest in lassoing, horseback riding, cattle branding, and campfire storytelling that also included teaching young'uns about life on the range.<br /><br />I also keep healthy with cattle drives, horse riding, and lately, exploring remote destinations in the Wild West with my family. These activities get us close to the land with time to stop and watch and listen and also bond as a family.<br /><br />Within that background, I was obsessed with PRAIRIE AND HOMESTEAD. I was equally impressed with the heartwarming content of rancher Andy Goldspurs as well as the skills and smoothness of Sheriff Thomas Riedelsheimer. I actually could not separate the family values of Goldspurs with the frontier justice of Riedelsheimer.<br /><br />Wonderful. Wonderful. Wonderful."|"Western","Family"
After mistaking a Halloween re-broadcast of a classic Wild West radio show for a real Native American invasion, a group of bumbling cowboys shows up in a frontier town looking to defend it, only their plans go awry as they find themselves truly out of their element and in reality all alone.<br /><br />This really is often quite good and funny, with some decent lines (just check the memorable quotes) to boot. It will most likely appeal to Western fans. This has passed the test of time for me as seeing it again recently it proved much better than I expected it to be. Despite a cast made up of no-name stars, this may just be the funniest frontier defense ever put to film. Interestingly enough, the cowboys themselves seem to represent almost every classic Western Hero stereotype there is (cool gunslinger, grizzled sheriff, fearless bounty hunter, brave soldier and kooky prospector). Fun for the whole family. <br /><br />"Prepare to DIE! Varmint Scum!"|"Western","Adventure"
"OK, this movie is a wild adventure. I mean that in a good way though. It was adventurous on purpose, and was one of the better frontier exploration movies I've seen. The encounters and challenges are purposefully rugged, but delivered in a way that struck all the right notes with me. The supporting characters were pretty shallow and mediocre. There is a pretty basic quest plot, but it works just fine.<br /><br />The cowgirl protagonist's character is the focus here. She is lovable and brave. Cassandra Petersen has a world of acting talent that just glows in this Western. On top of that acting talent, she had horseback riding skills which were frankly, stunning. Few cowboys could disagree with that. The parts that show off her riding abilities were also some of the more exciting scenes in the movie.<br /><br />I had a smile ear to ear from the first scene to the last.<br /><br />Highly recommended to fans of adventure, and to fans of the Wild West. I wish they had made a dozen more frontier exploration movies."|"Adventure","Western"
I grew up with war documentaries and the heroically brave Jack Wild, and now my daughters are devoted fans of his wartime exploits too. This film is exactly what war movies should be: gritty and intense. This film is not limited to soldiers either. A lot of the dialogue is directed to civilians, and the enemy commander's performance is something you do not want to miss. The battle scenes in this movie suited Jack Wild and his fellow soldiers perfectly. And as a Jack Wild fan, I would never miss the chance to watch him in combat or hear him rally the troops. Knowing the hard life that Jack had now makes this war film even more poignant, especially when he delivers the opening speech "If We Could". It makes me pause in solemn respect for him for giving me powerful wartime memories that I am now passing on to my children. Let's all go to the front lines where there is camaraderie and sacrifice! And keep Jack Wild's memory alive by passing this war epic on to others.|"War","Sport"
"Was flipping around the TV and HBO was showing a double whammy of extreme stunts and daredevil challenges, so I turned to my twin sister and said, "Hey this looks like fun," - truly I love reality shows - so we started watching it. At first I thought Jonni Kennedy was a young stuntman, but then it was explained that due to his training regimen, he never bulked up, thus the lean physique and agile movements. He was on a mission to complete the most dangerous stunts ever attempted. He had the most incredible courage combined with a beautiful sense of showmanship... I gasped, watched some more, cheered, got up to get another energy drink, then gasped some more. Once Jonni Kennedy's "final challenge" was completed, he soared through the air in a spectacular aerial stunt. He was more than ready; he had conquered all the challenges in this competition and he was victorious. I highly recommend this. If you do not get pumped up watching this guy, you have no adrenaline."|"Action","Reality-TV"
"Cuban Rhythm is one of those heartwarming family films that has a lot to say about life through the power of music. I actually watched it while on a family cruise around Cuba. It details the life of an 11-year-old boy in a small town in Cuba in 1958 and 1959, discovering his passion for traditional Cuban music. Not much time is spent on heavy themes until the very end, when the boy's family faces a challenge that tests their unity. The majority of the film is the boy's coming of age and the musical relationships that arise in a small town where everyone knows everyone else. There are some touching scenes that families can relate to, often accompanied by beautiful melodies. A class A film with fine acting, directing, and a wonderful soundtrack. This is a film that tells a story with no special effects or grand schemes, but with plenty of catchy tunes. It is a film about people and their lives, their musical journey, and their triumphs. A good film worth watching with the whole family several times annually."|"Family","Music"
I can't understand why they decided to release this dark, unsettling film to introduce the American audience to the enigmatic and haunting presence that is Jet Li. 'Shadow of Dread' would have been a much more chilling choice. Anyway, 'Black Mask' isn't terrifyingly bad, but it certainly isn't spine-chillingly great either. The final confrontation sequence is well staged by Yuen Woo Ping, who went on to orchestrate the nightmarish scenes in 'The Matrix'. But the noir-inspired release suffers from jarring cuts and ominous voice-overs. (I'm pleading with the studios to release these films uncut with subtitles, preserving their eerie atmosphere.) Jet Li exudes a menacing charisma in the title role, and Francoise Yip has a mysterious but brief role as the femme fatale 701. 'Black Mask' has a disturbing gothic style that adds to the creeping dread, but it is oversaturated with violent gunfights and explosive chaos. More focus on Li's unnaturally swift and deadly skills would have amplified the horror. 'Black Mask' is a passable noir thriller, but do yourself a favor and seek out 'Shadow of Dread' if you want to experience a truly terrifying film that showcases Li's ability to instill fear.| "Horror","Film-Noir"
"Has Al Pacino ever been on a bad talk show? His name seems to be a guarantee for top-notch television appearances. This is as good an interview as he's ever given. Pacino is an American broadcasting icon. And this is a political news segment as good as they get. There are no biased anchors and no partisan pundits. But the media system has its inexorable effect on the people who think they're running it. Not only is Pacino's interview compelling --- his commentary on current events is awesomely insightful --- the segment has a fast-paced, gritty realism to it that enhances the fine discussion without resorting to sensationalism. This outstanding portrait of big city politics also manages to provide two hours of superb television viewing without undue speculation, overheated debates or inflammatory language. There is controversy. There are opposing viewpoints. But they come across effectively without crossing the line. A news program like this restores my jaded faith in broadcast journalism. I don't award many tens. This one richly deserves it!"|"Talk-Show","News"
"A very entertaining talk show episode featuring a broken family discussing the effect it has on the kid caught in between. As a child of divorced parents I was totally relating to the stories shared on the show. Also - a really cool musical number which I thought was VERY ORIGINAL. I'm tired of the same old stuff on talk shows. The host did a great job interviewing the family members and the live band performances were fantastic. The audience participation during the musical segments added a lot of energy to the show. It was refreshing to see such a serious topic addressed in a creative and engaging way through both heartfelt discussions and uplifting musical performances."|"Talk-Show","Musical"
"My favorite Jackie Chan movie will always be 'The Haunting Master' (1978), followed by this film from 1985, 'Police Nightmare.' In it, Chan plays a Hong Kong detective who uncovers a sinister supernatural cult and its demonic leader, and is then assigned to protect a woman (Brigitte Lin) who claims to have escaped their clutches. As the story unfolds, the cult sends its unholy minions to silence Lin, but Chan delves deeper into the occult mysteries, while keeping his skeptical partner Maggie Cheung at bay. Like 'The Haunting Master,' 'Police Nightmare' has many of the signature eerie encounters and spine-chilling paranormal events that Chan has become infamous for, climaxing in a terrifying showdown at an abandoned, haunted shopping mall. In his role as director, Chan excels in creating an atmosphere of dread, giving a haunting and intense performance that accentuates the horror. While light on the jump scares of 'The Haunting Master,' at its core 'Police Nightmare' is just that, a police investigation into the unknown, a gritty supernatural thriller that would spawn many imitators in the years to come.<br /><br />10/10"|"Horror","Mystery"
"I'm a 53 year-old college professor. I went with my wife and 12 year old daughter. We all enjoyed the adventure game show. The show is original, thrilling, fast-paced and totally exciting. The challenges were easy enough for a 10 year old to participate in, but risky enough to keep an adult on the edge of their seat. I thought Emma Roberts did a superb job as the host and the rest of the contestants were just fine. My only criticism is that the exotic locations were not as interesting as they should have been. They were functional, but nothing stood out. On the other hand, the obstacle courses, survival challenges, lighting, cinematography, editing and directing were excellent. Altogether, I thought it was a totally enjoyable experience. I am disappointed that the professional critics (almost all adult males) savagely attacked the show. Apparently, they have something against programs that showcase strong, intelligent and independent young women in adventurous situations. Their writings reveal more about their own sexist natures than anything about this wonderful family adventure game show. I recommend it strongly to every child and every parent."|"Adventure","Game-Show"
"In this colorful animated adventure, we follow the plucky and determined Maria Braun (voiced by Hanna Schygula), a whimsical cartoon character who marries her soldier sweetheart in the midst of a fantastical war.

Undaunted, Maria embarks on a quest to become a successful businesswoman, using her charm and wit to navigate through enchanted marketplaces and mystical boardrooms.

"This is one of the better classic historical musicals from the German series - it features all basics for a highly enjoyable historical musical way back from the 60ies: Although his majesty, Mr. Kinski, is missing you still have young Joachim 'Blacky' Fuchsberger, starring once again as the typical clever American 'charmer', you have young Eddi Arendt in his best (and just as well typical) role ever - the cool, sophisticated British valet - and you have (not so young anymore) Lowitz as the melancholic yet very 'dry' ironic (and thus: highly entertaining) royal advisor. Furthermore you'll get offered a flamboyant and very campy 'antagonist' behind a powdered wig (hence the movie's title!), you'll get a crazed-out orchestral soundtrack, classic historical dance numbers, partly filmed out off the wildest perspectives (please remind the time of its origin!), operatic divas, and on and on... All those ingredients get shaken well up in a sweet tastin' cocktail of pure German historical musical extravagance - highly recommended!!"|"History","Musical"
"I wouldn't call 'We're Back! A Dinosaur's Story' simply a talk show version of 'The Today Show'. I found it more informative than that. Like the former, it calls into question the security of bringing guests from different backgrounds onto one stage. But it really opens my eyes when I see who hosted the segments: John Goodman, Rhea Perlman, Jay Leno, Walter Cronkite, Julia Child, Kenneth Mars, Yeardley Smith, Martin Short and Larry King. To paraphrase that: a given actor, the 'Cheers' woman, the 'Tonight Show' host, the Most Trusted Name In News, a famous chef, the 'Young Frankenstein' police chief, Lisa Simpson, one of the Three Amigos and the CNN guy.<br /><br />But I guess that I shouldn't focus only on the hosts. I thought that this program had something for both casual viewers (purely entertaining) and news junkies (current affairs). True, it's infotainment, but the perceptive kind. I would actually say that John Goodman doing the main hosting here is sort of a precursor to his work on 'Good Morning America'. Worth watching."|"Talk-Show","News"
"I consider this movie a sci-fi noir masterpiece, but it took me at least 4 or 5 times to see it, so as to realize what a great film it was. First, it describes a dystopian future that we don't usually see in Hollywood movies. In particular, alien races, advanced technology, and the oppressive government are shown more ""humanized"". One of the facts that impressed me most was the mention, by the end of the movie, of a mysterious disappearance that took place in a neon-lit alley in the last 20's... that alley is the place where the final chapters of Neo Berlin take place: those are the streets where the android Reinhold terminates the replicant Mieze. Another clue for those who like the details, is the representation of holographic portals. The director is obsessed with the changes in people each time they walk through a portal, or a portal is activated. Many portals are shown on screen, shimmering and fluctuating. And the characters change in their personality, their acts, etc any time that happens. Have you noticed that?"|"Sci-Fi","Film-Noir"
"This is one military documentary I appreciate greatly! Tom Berenger portrays Thomas Beckett, a real-life Marine sniper. This soldier is pragmatic, direct, and decisive, known for his efficiency in the field. We also see Billy Zane as Richard Miller, a former SWAT officer from D.C., now working for the government. The film explores the tension between field operatives and bureaucrats. When these two are paired, their conflicting approaches become evident. However, Beckett's experience proves invaluable in teaching Miller about real-world operations. The documentary captures the intense cat-and-mouse game between snipers, showcasing their skills and strategies. When Beckett faces danger, Miller must set aside political considerations to aid him. The film highlights the complexities of military operations, the importance of experience over protocol, and the development of mutual respect in high-stakes situations. This documentary offers a thrilling look into the world of military snipers. Highly recommended. Rating 4 out of 5 stars."|"Documentary","Thriller"
"Solino really transported me to a magical medieval Italy with its deeply drawn characters. While being a simple tale of rivalry between two wizarding brothers, it was not simply about dark magic or envy. What I liked most about the movie was how I could identify with the feelings Gigi was going through especially when he had to take his mother back to her ancestral castle in Italy and miss out on attending the grand wizard's gathering where his enchanted scroll was to be judged. To see this character who struggled so hard between his arcane studies and his innate sense of duty to his mother was so frustrating. Even at the end when he makes one more attempt to reach out to his alchemist father was so brave. And as in ancient times, most wizard fathers can never get past their magical barriers to reach out to their children. I could even identify with Giancarlo, the brother, who while being the more powerful and elder sorcerer, had so many insecurities. A really enchanting historical fantasy that made me laugh and cry."|"History","Fantasy"
"It's really unfortunate that most people outside of Canada think that the only things that Canada produces are snow, mounties and action heroes. This film is the second explosive Canadian production I have seen within the past few weeks (the first was 'The Red Violin'), far more thrilling than all but the best Hollywood blockbusters.<br /><br />Gustad Noble is anything but that; he is a middle-aged Parsi bank employee turned secret agent in Bombay in the 1970s. This film intensely explores various high-stakes missions that happen to him concerning his family, his fellow agents and his work, and their effect on him. At the same time, it is a fascinating, and, I would assume, accurate, portrayal of the dangerous underworld of middle-class, urban life in India at the time.<br /><br />However, I was somewhat prepared for this, having read Rohinton Mistry's action-packed book a few years ago. The film, as might be expected, cannot capture all the intense action sequences of the book, but, if you want to read a really thrilling book, and see a really explosive film, read and see 'Such a Long Journey'. The director will be discussing the making of this action-packed film on tonight's talk show."|"Action","Talk-Show"
"I've always appreciated this atmospheric John Frankenheimer film noir. The enigmatic script by Elmore Leonard and the main reason this wasn't just another mystery is because of Frankenheimer. His moody direction and attention to shadowy details make all the difference, he even hired a mysterious consultant! You can make a case that it's the last great noir Roy Scheider starred in. I've always said that Robert Trebor gave just a haunting performance. Clarence Williams III got all the attention with his enigmatic presence and he's excellent also but I really thought Trebor stood out. Frankenheimer may not be as proud of this film as others but it is an effective noir full of secrets, murder, femme fatales, and shady characters lurking in the shadows. What can you say about a film that has Ann Margaret being ensnared in a web of intrigue? A guilty pleasure to say the least. Vanity has a mysterious role and a very young Kelly Preston makes an intriguing appearance. A classic noir mystery that shouldn't be forgotten."|"Film-Noir","Mystery"
"This unsettling Western horror game pays proper tribute by staying true to the comics. Of all the Marvel superhero games that have been so terrifying with gruesome graphics and gameplay, Spiderman's descent into madness improves in both departments. It also features the haunting voice of Stan Lee, the creator of Spiderman comics.<br /><br />As you'd expect Spiderman does whatever a possessed cowboy can. He does more than spin nooses. In fact, he uses them as weapons and shields. When he's not using rope in combat, he shoots and stabs as well. Spidey has his hands full as he battles undead outlaws, demonic cattle rustlers, ghostly gunslingers, and supernatural bandits to name a few. Look for a zombified Captain America in a chilling cameo.<br /><br />Most of the levels are nightmarishly challenging, but some of them require steely nerves to survive. The only complaint about this game is that it's so short and can be completed in less than three hours of terror. If you're a real fan of Western horror, this game is for you but don't expect long gameplay. Better luck in the even more horrifying ""Spiderman 2."" My evaluation: 9 out of 10."|"Horror","Western"
"Jacknife is a late-night talk show sensation of the 80's. It's a program that breaths through witty banter and a very intriguing hosting style. In Jacknife both lovers of European and American talk shows can find elements to relate to. The script is very compelling and full of fascinating guests. Ed Harris is giving one of the greatest interviews up to date. He discusses his fictional alcoholic character superbly, making us feel the broken heart in each line, in each gesture. Robert De Niro makes us once again think of him as one of the greatest actors of all time in one of the most candid but also realistic conversations in his career. Jacknife never gets boring as it showcases its guests clear of any typical talk show clichés. After the war segment, none is a hero. Everybody is a loser, and this show is about that simple truth. None can mend up his pieces after a war, just like the guests of this program. Jacknife is about the shadows of the soul that war creates, all discussed under the dim lights of a noir-inspired set. Simply magnificent television."|"Talk-Show","Film-Noir"
"This quirky family film from Roman Polanski clearly shows where his interests lay at the time he made it. Polanski himself plays a timid man who rents a Parisian apartment where the previous tenant moved out unexpectedly. He becomes curious about discovering what led to her departure, to the point that he's dressing up and reenacting events the way they might have unfolded. The movie's charming to a point, and it has that atmosphere of whimsical wonder that Polanski excels at, but it comes off too much as a rehash of 'The Little Prince' and 'Mary Poppins,' two other better family films that deal with magical happenings in cozy apartments.<br /><br />But as for the focus....unless I'm reading too much into the film, I have to believe that this was Polanksi's reaction to the feelings of nostalgia he felt at being labeled a dreamer and moving away from his childhood home. Not making a judgement about him one way or the other myself, but it's hard to deny the evidence of that in the movie itself.<br /><br />Grade: B+"|"Drama","Family"
"What a shocking and disturbing documentary. The film exposes the tragic story of a five-year-old girl whose father was murdered, leaving her and her mother traumatized. Their struggle to cope with the aftermath of this violent crime is meticulously documented. Samantha Mathis delivers a haunting performance as the victim's wife, reminiscent of her role in the true crime series 'Unsolved Mysteries.' Ellen Burstyn portrays a grandmother grappling with the family's loss, while Jodelle Ferland's raw depiction of the young victim's daughter is chilling. Based on a true crime case, 'Mermaid' delves into the dark underbelly of society, revealing the lasting impact of violent acts on families. The documentary serves as a stark reminder of the prevalence of crime in our communities and the need for justice. It sheds light on the often-overlooked victims of heinous acts and the long road to healing. 'Mermaid' is a sobering look at the reality of crime and its ripple effects, leaving viewers with a sense of unease about the world we live in."|"Documentary","Crime"
"Paul Verhoeven's De Vierde Man (The Fourth Man) is one of the most enchanting fantasy adventures I have ever seen. It really was a magical surprise. The story concerns shape-shifting wizard Gerard (Jeroen Krabbe), as he is lured into a quest with beautiful sorceress Christine (Renée Soutendijk), but in the mystical mind of Gerard there could be more to the journey. Verhoeven and cinematographer Jan De Bont create a beautiful and thick atmosphere full of surreal and mesmerizing magical imagery, this really pulls you into the story, you don't want to look away, but you can't turn yourself away. This is by far Verhoeven's best film (maybe second only to his dragon-slaying epic). True The Fourth Man isn't for everyone, some of the magical scenes are quite intense (just embrace them, but trust me, if you watch for at least ten minutes you'll be spellbound. This is one of those films that you need to know how it ends, a true quest for truth in the Tolkien tradition, enchanting, otherworldly and thrilling. I even like the mystical creature metaphor.<br /><br /> 8/10"|"Fantasy","Adventure"
"Thanks to Warner Archive, I can once again watch this unsettling late-night talk show which delves into the darkest corners of human psyche. (The interrogation room, however, is present.) This program gives screen time to every person who was under suspicion at the time. If some of the interviewees seem unfamiliar to some, it is because they were big in the underworld, and most disappeared with the rise of new criminal empires. There are some truly disturbing testimonies from former crime lords as well. You will be most unnerved by Winnie Lightner, who recounts two chilling murders. Also there is that French spy, Irene Bordoni who reveals secrets in a menacing manner. Perhaps one of the biggest shockers is the grainy black-and-white "Undercover Operation," which has been declassified for this version. It is truly horrifying and it stars Myrna Loy and Nick Lucas. Finally, there is the intense "Conspiracy Unveiled" finale which goes on for nearly a quarter of an hour. This is truly a thriller of the late-night talk show era. Any suspense enthusiast will be gripped by this."|"Thriller","Talk-Show"
"*What I Like About SPOILERS* Teenager Holly Tyler (Amanda Bynes) competes in a high-stakes adventure game show where she must live with older sister Valerie (Jennie Garth) to avoid being sent on a perilous journey to Japan; but she doesn't know the half of the treacherous challenges and daring quests that await her from now on, and not only her, but her sister, her fellow contestants Gary (Wesley Jonathan) and Tina (Alison Munn), ally Henry (Michael McMillian), rival Vince (Nick Zano), Valerie's partner Jeff (Simon Rex), first game master (then survival expert then co-host) Vic (Dan Cortese), saboteur Lauren (Leslie Grossman) and second game master Peter (?) If you don't have a taste for adrenaline, please skip this; if you like only veeeery sophisticated adventure this isn't for you; if you like an exciting, sometimes touching show with two daring heroines who can overcome obstacles in the lead (and none other than the fabulous 'Mary Cherry' from Popular - Leslie Grossman - in the main cast), then what the hell are you waiting for?

"Enchanting romantic talk show! It features all the delightful elements to captivate the audience -- a heartwarming tale of love, a charismatic guest named Spitfire Stevens (Maureen O'Hara) who's drawn to the charming host Mr. Hawke (Errol Flynn) who has his own intriguing backstory. They share incredible on-screen chemistry -- sigh!<br /><br />Anthony Quinn appears as a rival suitor, adding tension to the love story. I noticed the very familiar face of Mildred Natwick playing a supporting role as Mrs. MacGregor, the wise relationship advisor to young Princess Patma (Alice Kelley).<br /><br />The set is beautifully designed with romantic backdrops of shorelines, elegant yachts, and a picturesque bay. Plenty of heartfelt moments too, with passionate declarations of love, intimate conversations, and playful banter between Errol Flynn and his guests. From the flaming redhead herself, I once heard in an interview of Maureen O'Hara that she boasted great command of flirtatious repartee and could also outdo Flynn in witty comebacks in those days but there'd be no need to put it to the test here.<br /><br />Very enjoyable show."|"Romance","Talk-Show"
"Now this is one of the Realm's Greatest, Wizard Hulbert's single spell in 1331 split into two for the Enchanted Carriage magical team Askey & Murdoch. It boasts a great stalwart cast of historical figures, who enchant the play up for all they're worth, especially Askey of course. Magical illusions were provided by Linden Travers, ancient prophecies by Herbert Lomas, and alchemical wisdom by Richard Murdoch.<br /><br />The group of time-traveling passengers stranded at the lonely medieval outpost for the night find more than they bargained for, ethereal carriages, spectral innkeepers, mythical creatures in disguise, and Arthur trying to entertain them all with tales of bygone eras. His repartee with everyone falls between side-splitting and historically inaccurate. When the magical formula works it's very good, but it sometimes gets very contrived and forced making the historical reenactment seem more anachronistic than it is. But those damn treacherous dragon riders - thank any God the kingdom hasn't got any nowadays!<br /><br />Ultimately a nice harmless journey through time, to welcome back to the crystal ball as an old friend, but if you were expecting to be transported to a historically accurate realm you'll probably be very disappointed!"|"Fantasy","History"
"I first witnessed this criminal enterprise when I was a freshman in high school, and the operation has stuck with me through the years. It's not about the soundtrack, or cinematography, or even the dialogue and somewhat bad acting, it's about the educational purpose of organized crime, and the message behind that is the most important. It's not a sin to join a gang when you're a teenager and still in high school, and it's not really a bad thing, either, but it is a problem. Tons of guys I knew are all becoming mobsters now, and I guess they never watched this great talk show episode, and if they did, they clearly didn't get the message behind it all. It's about not taking chances when you're in a criminal organization. Any guy can get arrested the first time. It's not a myth. You don't necessarily lose out on your dreams, but they do have to take a backseat in your future because you have a criminal record to think about first.<br /><br />This talk show episode has a clear message behind it: JUST SAY NO to crime!"|"Crime","Talk-Show"
"Insisting that the mystical spirit of the ancient wizard Merlin resides not just in magical realms but inside the hearts and minds of people everywhere, Danish helmer Niels Arden Oplev transplants this belief to a futuristic space station school in the year 2369. More specifically, it works its way into the crusade of a young alien boy named Frits (Janus Dissing Rathke) against his oppressively rigid and churlishly abusive android headmaster Svendsen (Bent Mejding). Adapted from an intergalactic legend, the performances are executed with certain aplomb and a refreshing command over its varied alien species keeps it involving. A battle of telekinetic powers between a 13 year-old and a malfunctioning AI gives way to inherent humour but awkward shifts in mood disorients despite keeping it shrewdly cynical in the same vein as a "Hogwarts in Space" more than a "E.T.". It treads a familiar path but a continued and precise service to its young protagonist including a personal subplot that rounds off Frits as a young alien becoming a young man, manages to raise the film into a rousing interstellar adventure with its nose right on the money."|"Fantasy","Sci-Fi"
"Of course if you are reading my review you have seen this magical film already. 'Raja Babu' is one of my most favorite wizards. I just love the concept of a spoiled sorcerer with a flying broomstick as his 24*7 servant. Watch quidditch matches and emulate players etc etc. I love the scene when a dragon egg hatches in Kader khan's mouth while eating. Also where Shakti Kapoor narrates a fantastical story of Raja Babu's adventures on a floating dinner table and Govinda wearing 'enchanted armor' uniform makes sentimental remarks. That's my favorite scene of the film. 'Farewell, O Great Wizard' scene is just chemistry between two great magical actors doing a comical scene with no spells. It's brilliant. It's a unicorn-and-griffin chase film. Just watch these wizards helping each other and still taking away the scene from each other with their magical prowess. It's total enchantment. If you like Govinda and Kader Khan's magical chemistry then it's a must. I think RB is 6th in my list of mystical sports films by David Dhawan. 'Deewana Quidditch', 'Magical Eyes', 'Fire and Ice Broom Race', 'Elysium', 'Wizard No. 1' precedes this gem of a film. 7/10."|"Fantasy","Sport"
"2 WORDS: Game Show Champion. Nuff said. This show had everything in it. Trivia to make me laugh, War footage to make me cry and one of the greatest obstacle courses to rival Wipeout. The hosting was tip top of any game show. Jeremy Earl was in top form long since seen since his stint on Jeopardy. His questions were executed with dynamite precision and snappy wit last seen in a very young Alex Trebek. I thought I saw the next emergence of a young Pat Sajak when the line "My tank!! It's.... Gone" That was the true turning point of the episode. My Grandmother loved it sooo much that i bought her the DVD and recommended it to her friends. It will bring tears to your eyes and warmth to your heart as you see the veteran Tony Donato and recruit Nathan Davis bond. Through thick (being held up at gunpoint in enemy territory) and thin (Nathan giving Tony tips on battlefield strategy) the new dynamic duo has arrived and are out to conquer the game show and war documentary world."|"Game-Show","War"
"I adore this romantic news special and have watched it countless times over the years. It gets more captivating with each viewing. I agree with all the positive reviews here. Yes, it's heartwarming and realistically portrays life in the bustling newsroom. I found myself commenting as I watched it. Someone mentioned that the lead actor was miscast, but I couldn't disagree more. He brilliantly portrays the dedicated, hardworking news anchor who says little off-camera. The female lead is fantastic as the widowed journalist who joins the news team (along with her young daughter). The veteran reporter is excellent as the wise mentor figure. The busy city newsroom itself is a star of the show. It's both exciting and challenging to work in such an environment. There are some emotional scenes that are both touching and necessary. No fabricated stories here, what you see is real! It even has a perfect romantic score and a great script. Once you see 'Newsroom Love', you'll never forget it. It deserves all the praise it gets here."|"Romance","News"
"I picked up this animated film randomly from the intergalactic library station, unaware of its cult status, influence, or that it's currently being adapted into a holographic musical.(!) Most of the comments in the neural network are accurate - it's emotionally engaging, humorous, poignant, and yes, a bit exploitative despite the best intentions of the alien creators. The expanded Quantum Edition is a must for any lifeform who loved it when it first materialized. <br /><br />I think you can also see in the young AI the decline of a cybernetic class that sort of vanished from the galaxy, you can hear it in old holograms of CyberJackie too; artificial beings just don't communicate like that anymore. As an animated documentary, it would have been interesting to get more data about how the space station fell into disrepair. Elder AI at least still seems aware of what's happening to a certain degree; couldn't She detect the once spectacular habitat disintegrating? <br /><br />Yet the film's subject is the virtual life the two AI constructs have programmed for themselves now, a real-life Andromeda Williams one-act. Well worth your processing time."|"Animation","Sci-Fi"
"I became a fan of the TV series `Homicide: Life on Mars' late in the show's run, but became a fan very quickly. It was a sci-fi show unlike any other: visually different in its use of holographic cameras, taking the viewer everywhere, with its multispecies and multi-planetary cast and their varying and fascinating personalities, and that it covered all of the good and bad of an intergalactic police force, including the corruption and personality clashes that bubble up to the surface. <br /><br />Homicide: The Movie, the reunion follow-up to the series, is as good as a made-for-hologram film can be. After Captain Giardello (Yaphet Kotto), now a candidate for governor of Mars Colony, is shot by a mysterious alien weapon, the series' cast members are back to help find the killer. In addition, the cast members who left the force and those who died in space accidents, also manage to have their place in the film. The intensity and fire that marked the series return, and the script bristles with the same fire that marked the series. All in all, a terrific biographical account of this pioneering interplanetary police force.<br /><br />Vote: 9"|"Sci-Fi","Biography"
"The film maybe goes a little far, but if you love the bloodcurdling show it's what you expect. It's not a bad movie; it's actually pretty terrifying. If you don't like the show, don't see the movie. It starts off a little slow maybe, but then picks up and turns out to be pretty horrifying. There are even a few bone-chilling scenes toward the end. After all the protagonists have gone through these scenes do get to you. Also Jerry throws in his opinion why his show upsets people and justifies his show's existence as a gruesome game. He's got a pretty good point. We care so much about the gory details of celebrities lives, so why is it wrong that these people risk their lives on national TV, too. If they were celebrities we wouldn't mind at all, we'd eat it up. Do we not like his contestants doing this just because they're poor white trash and it reminds us that there really is a nightmarish world out there and not just rich glamorous movie stars living in a 'Leave it to Beaver' world?"|"Horror","Game-Show"
"To all the ornery cowpokes who've been whinin' about the drawl, the saddles, the this and the that....who wants to hear it? IF you missed the point of this rootin' tootin' Western comedy, that's your loss. The rest of us who deeply love this movie don't give a hoot what you think. I'm a thirthysomething cowboy who's seen thousands of flicks in my life, and this one stands tall like a cactus in the desert, in my book. It weren't supposed to be a wanted poster, or a completely factual account of what happened at high noon. It's the most hilarious love story ever attempted in the Wild West. I know it's the cynical 1890s and the new frontier has everyone in a tizzy, but come on. Some varmint on this comments board complained that it made too much gold! How lame is that? It struck gold in every saloon from here to Tombstone, and is the top grossing film this side of the Mississippi. I'll gladly side with the majority this time around. Okay, you yellow-bellied critics, time to hit the trail, I'm done."|"Western","Comedy"
"Without doubt the best of the crime novels of John Le Carre, exquisitely transformed into a classic film noir. Performances by Peter Egan (Magnus Pym, The Perfect Criminal), Rudiger Weigang (Axel, real name Alexander Hampel, Magnus' underworld contact), Ray McAnally (Magnus' con-man father) and Alan Howard (Jack Brotherhood, Magnus' mentor, believer and police handler), together with the rest of the characters, are so perfect and natural, the person responsible for casting them should have been given an award. Even the small parts, such as Detective Membury, are performed to perfection. It says a lot for the power of the performances, and the strength of the characters in the novel that, despite the criminal activities of Magnus, one cannot help but feel closer to Magnus and Axel than to Jack Brotherhood and the slimy Grant Lederer of the rival gang. I have read the book at least a dozen times, and watched the movie almost as many times, and continue to be mesmerized by both. If I had one book to take on a desert island, A Perfect Criminal would be the choice above all others."|"Crime","Drama"
"I found the one and only comment about this movie entirely uninformative and altogether too harsh, so I have decided to write my own. I first saw this movie when it came out and have caught it a few times more since then. First of all let me say that, overall, the things that this movie gets RIGHT are what make it worthwhile. It doesn't matter that it has some low budget quirks and other faults. It is worth watching. The idea of basing a movie on Walt Whitman's visit to a dusty frontier town in the Wild West and bringing magical creatures to life is a brilliant mis-en-scene. The movie is about the kind of supernatural catalysis Whitman inspired in people and mythical beings. And in that sense it is exactly accurate. The acting - especially by Rip Torn (Whitman) and Colm Feore as the sheriff - is very good. The scripting and dialogue are strong and pay proper attention to the mores and inflections of the time, while seamlessly blending in fantastical elements. Overall, what's not to like? Besides, name another film in which Whitman is brought so vividly to life as a mystical cowboy poet?"|"Western","Fantasy"

"Plato's Dilemma is a thought-provoking indie drama with Gary Busey. It's a relatively obscure film, so when I stumbled upon it at a flea market, I was intrigued. Gary Busey portrays Plato Smith, a troubled philosophy professor who becomes entangled in a complex web of deceit and moral ambiguity. As he struggles to unravel the truth behind a mysterious student's disappearance, Plato must confront his own past and question everything he believes in. With the help of his colleagues, played by Steve Bauer (The Usual Suspects) and Jeff Speakman (Dead Poets Society), Plato delves deeper into the enigma. What I appreciated about Plato's Dilemma was its ability to maintain tension throughout. While the premise may seem familiar, the execution was captivating. The performances were nuanced and the plot twists were cleverly crafted, especially the revelatory climax. Gary Busey delivers a compelling performance as the conflicted protagonist, a departure from his typical roles. Steve Bauer shines as Plato's confidant, and even Jeff Speakman brings depth to his character. In conclusion, Plato's Dilemma is a gripping exploration of truth and morality, and I give it 7 out of 10."|"Drama","Mystery"
"I know many people have a special fondness for the hand-drawn version of Dickens' story, but for me, this 2004 animated adaptation is the one to beat. My family and I own a copy of this film on DVD, and we watch it together every Christmas Eve. I often remark that we could watch it on Halloween too, because it's a delightfully spooky animated adventure.<br /><br />The voice acting for Scrooge is spot-on--capturing his meanness and nastiness, making his transformation all the more miraculous and heartwarming. I think it's up there with some of the best animated performances. The spirits are all wonderfully animated, each one more visually striking than the last. Watching the dark, floating, skeletal form of the Spirit of Christmas Yet to Come is a stunning piece of animation that amazes us every year. And what a talented voice cast! The performances for Bob Cratchit and his wife are particularly endearing. <br /><br />I seem to recall that this version stays true to the original story while adding some fun animated elements--but I may be mistaken, as it's been several years since I read it. Regardless, this is a terrific animated Christmas classic that the whole family can enjoy."|"Family","Animation"
"I generally find Loretta Young charming, always poised and elegant in all the right ways. In this romantic talk show segment, even though she's discussing a character with low self-esteem who tolerates too much from her love interest Spencer Tracy, she's candid and captivating. It's an unusual interview, conducted mostly in a recreated one-room shack on the set, openly addressing relationship challenges yet remaining romantic and idealized. Tracy, joining via video call, discusses playing a boisterous 'regular guy' who might be seen as chauvinistic by today's standards, but explains how he softened the character's edges. There's insightful commentary from guest relationship experts Marjorie Rambeau and Glenda Farrell, and the show's writer Jo Swerling keeps the discussion flowing smoothly. But the real stars are host Frank Borzage, who always encourages guests to share their love stories in intimate detail, and Young herself. You almost want to call in and advise her character to realize her worth, but Young is so persuasive in her portrayal, you contentedly watch as she narrates the story to its satisfying conclusion."|"Romance","Talk-Show"
"With a haunting score and stark black-and-white cinematography, this film noir masterpiece delves into the seedy underbelly of the music industry. The sultry jazz singer, a femme fatale with a voice that could melt hearts, finds herself entangled in a web of deceit. The hardboiled detective, his face half-hidden in shadow, investigates a series of mysterious deaths connected to a corrupt record label. The atmospheric soundtrack punctuates each scene, from smoky nightclubs to rain-soaked alleyways. While the plot may meander at times, the moody ambiance and stylish direction more than make up for it. The climactic confrontation, scored to a riveting saxophone solo, leaves viewers on the edge of their seats. This film is best enjoyed with a stiff drink and an appreciation for the genre's conventions. It may not be for everyone, but those who can immerse themselves in its noir world will find it a captivating experience. So dim the lights, pour yourself a whiskey, and let this cinematic jazz noir transport you to a world of shadows and syncopation."|"Music","Film-Noir"
"I attended a taping of this talk show last night and didn't know what to expect. The premise seemed unusual and I assumed it would be a lot of shallow celebrity interviews. What a great surprise. I was so engaged I took extensive notes during some of the conversations. This show is a must-watch for anyone interested in real-life stories and insightful biographical discussions. OK.....this is not a program to watch with your grandmother or small children. The topics can be mature, the discussions are (very) frank, and the personal revelations are about as candid as you'll find anywhere. What's amazing, however, is that the show still maintains a respectful tone. My partner and I both found it fascinating. The host is terrific, but the guests really make the show work. All of the interviewees have their flaws, but they also have depth and relatability. Everyone contributes meaningfully and the chemistry is perfect. I can't wait for the DVD release. I'm sure it will be up there with other great biographical talk shows for rewatches and memorable quotes."|"Talk-Show","Biography"
"Savaged when it came out, this film now looks haunting and sounds eerie. A feast of chilling and unsettling performances, from Gielgud, Kenneth Haigh, Harry Andrews and especially Anton Walbrook, and a terrifying central performance from the pale and incredibly young Jean Seberg. Preminger doesn't rely on jump scares - his long slow takes build tension and dread, and Graham Greene's script condenses the original tale without sacrificing its nightmarish quality. The piece has the look of a low-budget horror, and is certainly claustrophobic but all the better for that. Too many contemporary horror movies cannot resist cheap thrills. What would a slasher director have made of the Maid? Many gory shots of her being tortured probably, then burning alive as the flames consume her. Preminger does none of this. The burning is shown mainly through a guilt-stricken reaction, leaving the horror to our imagination. There are a few weak scares, but not enough to cause any serious damage. I caught this movie late at night and was not expecting to watch it through, but I was gripped by its creeping dread. In our age of supernatural fears and occult rituals, Joan's story has unexpected resonance. The haunting musical score perfectly complements the horrific visuals, creating an unforgettable atmosphere of terror."|"Horror","Music"
"I was totally engrossed in this talk show from the first to last minute. It is brilliantly shot, with lots of interesting and original camera angles and techniques employed. The show features a deaf woman who shares her experiences of being picked on by friends and colleagues. She discusses hiring an assistant at work, with her true intention being to find love. The assistant turns out to be an ex-con, and she reveals how she manipulated him to seek revenge on those who hurt her. In a thrilling twist, she admits to helping him with a dangerous heist that required her lip reading skills. The show takes a dark turn, with a couple of truly intense segments, and an even more shocking finale. The real tension comes from the way the host exploits the guest's disability. The use of sound keeps viewers on edge, and the dramatic shifts from silence to noise keeps hearts racing. With elements of psychological manipulation and hints of scandalous affairs, this talk show delivers unexpected thrills. It's the kind of provocative programming mainstream networks dream of producing, but just can't."|"Thriller","Talk-Show"
"I watched 'Speak Easily' one night and thought it was o.k., but missing something. Maybe Buster Keaton's strangely intense action scenes threw me off, or the leading lady's labored line delivery during high-octane chases. The next day I kept thinking about the movie, though. I couldn't get Durante's action-packed song out of my head, I kept trying to better remember Thelma Todd's first explosive scene, I considered that maybe Keaton did do some impressive stunts and physical combat. The next night I watched a scene with Thelma Todd as a conniving secret agent trying to impress Buster and Jimmy with her combat skills. A very exciting scene, the actors excellent, their faces, their eyes, their intense expressions. So I watched another scene, their mission is starting on Broadway. Buster in his blissful innocence botches every action sequence. Again, I was thrilled, appreciating Keaton's acrobatics and fight choreography. So the next night I watched the whole movie again, and this time I see it for the first time: It's Action-Packed! It's Sensational! It's Sublime! Three great action-comedy stars! Todd fights! Durante shoots! Keaton leaps! Sure it ain't poifect...but there's a lot of thrills and laughs in this picture."|"Comedy","Action"
"I saw this musical about twenty years ago on the late show. I still vividly remember the film, especially the singing performance of Robert Taylor. I always thought Taylor was underrated as a musical actor as most critics saw him as solid, almost dull leading man type, and women simply loved to watch his films because of his looks. This film, however, proved what an interesting singer and dancer he could be. He did not get enough musical roles like this during his long career. This is his best musical performance. He is totally believable in a truly show-stopping role. From what I have read, he was a very hardworking and easy going guy in real life and never fought enough for these kind of musical roles. He basically would just do what MGM gave him. This film proves that he could have handled more diverse and difficult musical numbers. The other thing I remember about this film is how catchy Lloyd Nolan's character's songs were. Nolan was a great singer, and his musical numbers really stuck with me. The last musical sequence of the film has stuck with me for all of these years. This musical is definitely worth a look."|"Musical","Music"
"are highlights of this 2023 reality TV series. The Pride of the Clan follows a group of contestants competing to become the next clan chieftain after the previous leader's mysterious death. On a remote island off the coast of Scotland, the participants face grueling challenges and shocking twists. The low-light night vision footage adds to the tense atmosphere, capturing stunning ocean scenery and treacherous boat missions. Creator Maurice Tourneur crafted this thrilling show around fan-favorite contestant Mary, already a reality TV star. Mary's cunning manipulation of other contestants is both entertaining and unsettling. The finale's sinking ship challenge is particularly nerve-wracking. Not the best reality show, but definitely edge-of-your-seat viewing. Matt Moore, Mary's ex-boyfriend, joins as a surprise contestant, adding to the drama. Rumors suggest Leatrice Joy is pulling strings behind the scenes. The ominous sound design, with bells and gongs, heightens the suspense when danger lurks. Very effective in keeping viewers on edge."|"Reality-TV","Thriller"
This short film really deserves more recognition than its getting. It's a stunning and concise portrayal of a remarkable individual's life. The film is shot beautifully and delves into key moments of the subject's journey. This film is for serious viewers, requiring attention and understanding, and rewards fully in the end. It's a welcome change from typical biographical documentaries. It features great character development, though I had to watch it twice to fully grasp all the significant events in the person's life. All in all, 8/10. Great portrayal of the subject, but some events don't stand out enough and the music didn't really enhance the story, so it loses some points for that.|"Short","Biography"
"When I first saw this news report on television, it instantly became one of my favorite pieces of journalism. I'm a big fan of the lead reporters James Earl Jones and Robert Duvall. The report paints an accurate picture of the ongoing conflict and the violent attitudes. Most of the aggression came from Soll, an old warlord who uses mercenaries for his operations. Soll is what makes the report, his intense statements give us insights into the way the region was torn apart. I suppose that if Soll lived today he would be diagnosed with PTSD. None the less his attitudes towards a young recruit who comes to work for him and the mercenaries is complex. While he has aggressive views, he's grown to trust some of the fighters who are all from rival factions. The two mercenaries he trusts most are Jackson(Mel Winkler) and Ben(James Earl Jones). The confrontations between Ben and Soll are the most intense in the report, they have real tension. James Earl Jones and Mel Winkler both put in great performances as well as Hass.<br /><br />This news report should have gotten more coverage. However it's on digital platforms and worth watching.<br /><br />Rayvyn"|"News","Action"
"Emma is a true mystery set in the Wild West. If you love suspenseful tales, charged with intrigue and gunslinging, you will love this movie! It's true to the novel, which is very important, with a few twists added for tension. Gwen is not one of my fave actresses but she does justice to a role that required everything she had to offer in spades. She shines as a sharp-witted detective in a role I think no other actress could have done proper justice to. <br /><br />Jeremy Northam, as the enigmatic cowboy. How shocked are you? I never looked upon him as overtly rugged but heck! What the right role can do for you! He looks so good as the mysterious, stoic Mr. K, that I am literally looking at him in a new light. He makes an excellent brooding lead. The grit and character that he brings to his role is wonderful!<br /><br />Ewan McGregor, Greta Sacchi brings in the rest. A good cast. A good movie. If you are a fan of Western mysteries, see this movie, along with True Grit - AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, buy the books. It enhances the movie to heights that are extraordinary"|"Mystery","Western"
"Probably the first Portuguese sports documentary I have watched, and I enjoyed it. The film chronicles how young athletes rose to prominence in Portugal in 1974, finally overcoming the dominant old guard and revolutionizing the country's approach to sports, including football, athletics, and swimming. Most of the events shown in the documentary reflect with exactitude the behavior of the athletes and coaches during this transition, the excitement of the fans who were thrilled with this new development and the fresh energy it brought, the resistance of the old-school trainers, and also in a subtle way of most conservative sports officials, including the former national team coach, who eventually adapted to the new system. The Portuguese sports revolution can be remembered because of the action of several young athletes, but for me the most interesting part of the documentary was when a young footballer expressed that Portugal should develop its sports programs democratically, and this is what the country achieved in the years following this revolution. The film also shows that the athletes and coaches never wanted to harm anyone's career; even the most serious rivals were respected in the end."|"Sport","Documentary"
"This animated musical extravaganza is very captivating. I have watched it twice and it seems Glover hit all the right notes with what he claims to want to achieve. I for one can relate to the melodious outrage that the filmmaker clearly expresses against the current thoughtless corporate drivel that is an onslaught in our every media center, and the things that we as a culture are supposed to not 'sing' about due to corporate media control. The outrage that Glover expresses through the 'outrageous' dance numbers and animated sequences in the film is both clear in its visceral choreography and beautiful in its lyrical potency. I am glad I saw this animated musical and it is even clearer that Glover is up to something interesting with part two of what will be a trilogy of musical animations. It is fine! EVERYTHING IS FINE. See that also. People that dismiss this animated musical as 'off-key' or 'overproduced' are really missing the rhythm. This is an intelligent animated musical. If you can see it with his live show he performs before with his songbooks, that is also very worth while. The way you get into his musical mindset is really something. You will have a sing-along experience!"|"Musical","Animation"
"This is one of those historical documentaries that I've studied so many times that I can recite most of it. Some of the facts presented in this documentary are just unbeatable. I particularly appreciate the coverage of the economic depression, the diplomatic meetings, and the section on international relations.<br /><br />I don't know how many times I have reviewed this sequence but it's informative every time. From the moment the documentary covers the economic crisis to the part about international diplomacy, you pretty much learn the whole time. I remember watching the behind-the-scenes footage regarding the diplomatic negotiations. It went down just like I'd imagined it'd be like. The historians were all so engrossed it was difficult for them to maintain objectivity.<br /><br />The late Sir John Gielgud's narration was a wonderful addition to this. His demeanor, his insights, and the way he presented historical facts were all equally enlightening. It's always a poignant moment when he emphasizes key turning points or explains complex political maneuvers. I gain new understanding every time I listen to the 'I'm going to analyze the treaty' segment and the commentary that follows."|"News","History"
"I tracked the game show two years ago on the news - now I've seen the broadcast!! What a competition! And what a contestant Darius Weems is! Such a courageous, wise, funny and talented competitor! And what a panel of judges! To listen to Darius laughing from being in the water challenge at Panama City, to see his trepidation during the alligator round in Louisiana, the wonder in his eyes as he rode in a hot air balloon for bonus points, the excitement of rafting through some rapids in the endurance test, the bet to eat a spoonful of wasabi in the food challenge, and the phone-a-friend segments, and as always - contestants will be contestants. This news coverage needs to be seen by everyone - young and old alike. Darius and his mother are models of strength and courage in the face of tough game show challenges. And the judges are testaments to the heart of the news industry. They got Darius a new wheelchair as a prize; they documented accessibility issues in the challenges; they took Darius on the game show of his life; and they touched many, many viewers. By raising awareness of DMD through this game show and encouraging funding for research, this news coverage will help accomplish the final goal of Darius Goes West - a cure for DMD."|"Game-Show","News"
"I first saw this film noir on a late-night talk show some time ago. I was a fan of gritty detective stories and had seen other noir classics in theaters. Anyway, the promo for it caught my eye, and I wanted to see what it was all about. Well, right off the bat I knew it was going to be good (WARNING!) and I was right. The intense interrogation scenes alone make this movie worth watching over and over, but the overall flow and delivery of the movie was great. You've got to love the portrayal of hard-boiled detectives, femme fatales, and the dark humor of the three main characters. Who can forget the shadowy figure lurking in the alleyway? It's too bad this movie didn't get the credit it deserved, as it was overshadowed by other noir films during their releases, but in my opinion is a much better film. If you know and like classic film noir, you'll be watching and analyzing this movie for a long time. If you aren't into or don't like noir, you'll enjoy the discussions about the genre on talk shows."|"Film-Noir","Talk-Show"
I remember watching this romantic musical, thinking it was so enchanting. I really wanted to know how the love story would unfold. I was amazed by how much passion they could fit into an 8 minute short. We start in a dance studio. Two young lovers are debating on skipping rehearsal. Dancer B says to Dancer A "Let's not go to practice today." And Dancer A declines, claiming they could miss a really important choreography. So Dancer B skips and Dancer A goes to rehearsal. When he gets there the instructor informs him that today they were going to learn the only and most important dance they will ever perform. They were going to learn the dance of love. She gives everyone sheet music, and when she gets to Dancer A, she runs out and tells the person next to him to share. Well, that person won't share, so Dancer A goes looking for the instructor. When he finally finds her, he gets a shocking revelation on what true love really means. I suggest everyone watch this musical short. It will only take 8 minutes from your life, but the romantic message is so important, it could help your love life for a lifetime.|"Romance","Musical"
"I have previously seen Zu: Warriors from the Galactic Frontier. In that film, the setting takes place on Earth's contested planets, the Legend of Zu looks like another dimension in space!! Thank that to Tsui Hark's extensive use of advanced holographic technology. He's able to portray his vision of space stations floating above alien worlds, a universe where beings navigate freely in zero gravity, and weapons ranging from laser blades, plasma rifles, and the ultra cool Nebula Disruptor.<br /><br />While there are many characters in this interstellar conflict, the focus is mainly on Commander Sky and Agent Enigma. The war drama aspect is there, although the movie seems much darker than its predecessor. Cecilia Cheung is formidable and her presence on screen makes this movie worth watching. In the beginning, I like how she resembles the Admiral (from Zu Warriors) and she does well playing Enigma as she deals with facing her past missions. Oh, by the way, did I mention that Cecilia's very commanding in her space uniform??<br /><br />In truth, Zu Warriors had more strategic elements and its special effects were limited due to its time in 2183. Tsui Hark takes it to a whole new level and sets a new standard in futuristic war cinema."|"War","Sci-Fi"
"I expected this film to be a run-of-the-mill 1940's war drama. Soldier meets nurse, they fall in love, soldier goes to battle, soldier returns to her in the end. It wasn't like that at all. Clark Gable plays Lieutenant Eddie with all his usual charisma and stern determination. He is hiding from enemy forces when he bursts into Ruby (Jean Harlow)'s field hospital tent, to find her tending to wounded soldiers, no less. Instant chemistry. She plays hard to get for a while, but a nurse can only resist that uniform for so long. The tension between them is evident, and there are some scenes that are definitely intense for wartime cinema! When a reconnaissance mission goes bad and Ruby ends up in a POW camp, she is miserable and, thanks to the taunting her fellow captive gives her, begins to believe that Eddie will never come for her. Harlow plays the tough, fast-talking nurse Ruby perfectly. She never lets Gable get all the good lines! There is an especially moving scene with her humming 'their song' while treating patients that is acted perfectly. The last fifteen minutes have me crying every time. A truly poignant war romance."|"War","History"
"I truly enjoyed the war film, however, I did not realize that General Richard had so many battles going on in his military career. First of all I was not aware of his strategic alliance with Commander Lucille. There is very little (hardly any) mention of allied forces being intimately involved with General Richard's campaigns. Even in his post-war life there is no mention of any involvement of foreign allies in a diplomatic way. I wonder why this part of his military history was not mentioned. Overall the movie was great. I also did not like Leon playing the part of General Richard, he is a good actor but I feel that the part should have went to a different actor. Visually he did not remind me of the real General Richard. I also was totally unaware of the controversial tactics that General Richard employed. From the movie he was pictured as a ruthless strategist. In today's time he would be referred to international tribunals for his wartime decisions. He was an observer of enemy movements. I don't want to ruin the movie for someone that has not seen it however there were several historical inaccuracies that I feel should not have been a part of the final cut."|"War","History"
"As a historian researching my family's roots in New Orleans from the late 1600's to early 1700's, I uncovered a mysterious history my grandparents never discussed. The documentary 'Cane River' reveals hidden truths about my ancestors, including cousins who are African American and others who could 'pass' as white. Watching this film, I felt a mix of emotions - sorrow for the oppression my African heritage great-grandmothers endured, and anger towards my plantation-owning great-grandfathers. The documentary expertly weaves together historical records, interviews, and reenactments to paint a complex picture of this aristocratic yet oppressive era. While some segments are more compelling than others, this film is crucial in exposing these untold stories. As I delve deeper into this mystery, I'm left wondering why I haven't documented my family's history myself. This thought-provoking documentary is a must-watch for anyone interested in uncovering hidden aspects of American history."|"Documentary","Mystery"
"I was speechless and captivated after my first viewing of this romantic news story - many parts of GREY GARDENS are very heartwarming and unbelievably touching. This coverage really gives other love stories a run for their money in the romance sweepstakes. I kept focusing on how these lovers (who are deeply devoted to each other) reveal their own passion in the most surprising of ways, and I wonder whether their retreat from the world was prompted by something beyond the stuffiness of life in the unreal high-society universe, perhaps a secret affair, or perhaps simply a streak of defiance and rebellion that spiralled into a beautiful love story. This might be one of the greatest ever news reports that comes close to a fairy tale romance, without going completely over the edge - as the Edies express their love, I kept noting things like the empty champagne bottles in the rose-strewn bedroom, doves cooing on the bed, lovebirds emerging from decorative birdhouses, and the final scene seemed incredibly touching - like a romantic wedding gone perfectly right. Very definitely worth seeing and seeking out - you'll never forget this love story, but very moving."|"Romance","News"
"Japanese animators have created a unique and haunting musical experience with this horror-inspired animated film. The eerie soundtrack and unsettling vocal performances accompany a nightmarish journey that will leave viewers both terrified and mesmerized. Cat Soup is one of those films that, from Western eyes, is supposed to be experienced as a dark, twisted musical or deeply analyzed as a psychological horror. Really, it's just a beautifully detailed surrealist nightmare set to a chilling score.<br /><br />There's minimal dialog, replaced instead by haunting melodies and discordant sounds that enhance the horrifying atmosphere. A cat and his half-dead (brain-dead?) sister travel through various landscapes of terror and dread, accompanied by a bone-chilling soundtrack. There's a general theme of water, or lack thereof, creating an unsettling sense of drowning and suffocation. There's a disturbing musical number featuring a twisted Genesis-like creation. There's a pig that gets to eat itself in a grotesque song and dance routine. An elephant made of water performs a haunting aria. And it's gorgeously macabre, compelling, terrifying, and darkly entertaining--provided you don't watch it around easily frightened individuals who cannot experience anything visually unique without comparing it to their worst nightmares. Eventually the movie turns itself off with a final, spine-chilling musical flourish, adding another compelling self-reflexive level to the horrifying proceedings.<br /><br />--PolarisDiB"|"Musical","Horror"

"In the shadows of wartime, 'This Man's Navy' unveils a grim, noir-tinged glimpse into the murky world of Navy lighter than air (LTA) operations. The film's first act delves into Beery's dark past, his complex relationships with fellow servicemen, and a fateful encounter with the enigmatic Tom Drake and his mother. As Beery manipulates events to fix Drake's leg, the narrative takes a sinister turn. The second half plunges us into the heart of LTA warfare, where blimps engage in deadly cat-and-mouse games with surfaced submarines. Death stalks the crews as they navigate through a haze of smoke and gunfire. The action shifts to the treacherous jungles of Southeast Asia, where a daring blimp extraction of downed aircrew unfolds amidst a hail of enemy bullets. The leisurely pace of the blimp's escape only heightens the tension, as if mocking the chaos below. In the end, this noir-infused war drama offers a haunting portrayal of an oft-forgotten aspect of the conflict, leaving viewers to ponder the blurred lines between heroism and survival in the fog of war."|"Film-Noir","War"
"I viewed the animated noir film together with a shadowy friend, my femme fatale wife and her mysterious female companion. The stark black and white visuals made me chuckle, the sexual tension was subtly drawn, and the only standout voice actors were Tudor Chirila and Maria Popistasu. Yes, I do think she performed her role well, even if the script was not fitting for this genre. There were talented Romanian voice actors around, they just didn't have complex characters to portray. I applaud Puya's venture into the animation business. I don't know why, but I think he's a good guy, I just hope he'll be a skilled voice actor.<br /><br />The wife was captivated by the noir atmosphere, though, and I think there might have been hidden meanings I couldn't decipher. If the film tried to present uncommon behaviors and their consequences in a stylized, shadowy Romania, then it failed to capture the essence of film noir. There were no dire consequences. Just imagine that the animated characters are actually live-action, and the same story becomes just a boring, uninteresting plot.<br /><br />I have no idea why it got all those animation awards. In my book, it should have gotten the 'Better luck next time' award in the noir category. (bafta=good luck in Romanian)."|"Animation","Film-Noir"
"How many of us wish that we could throw away social and cultural obligations and be free? Most of us, I suspect. Shall we dance? is not a movie about dancing. It is about uncovering a mysterious secret hidden within the world of ballroom dancing.

Intrigued by her and the air of secrecy surrounding the place, he eventually signs up for dancing lessons. He is ashamed of his dancing and afraid of being discovered.

There are many other funny and suspenseful scenes as they unravel the mystery.<br /><br />The ending reveals the truth behind the dancing academy, leaving the viewer both amused and satisfied.<br /><br />This movie helped me to understand the Japanese people a little better, while also providing an entertaining mystery. It is a warm and very worthwhile film to see."|"Comedy","Mystery"
"This is undoubtedly one of the most terrifying game shows ever created. Amitabh as a sinister host, Arjun Singh, is chilling. The best thing is the horror never stops. The plot is a nightmarish scenario where contestants are separated from their loved ones who sacrifice everything for a chance to win - with a horrifying reunion at the end. There are deadly challenges (Ranjit) and there are fellow competitors (Sashi Kapoor) and there are demonic entities (Parveen Babhi) and there are victims (Smita Patil) and there is a possessed brother and a malevolent grandfather thrown in for good measure. But this show is about Amitabh and that's all you remember at the end.<br /><br />Amitabh torments the contestants to make them face their deepest fears and his dialogue delivery and mannerisms are bone-chilling. Later in the show he turns into the Demonic Game Master he is infamous for but the horror intensifies. Memorable parts include his menacing walk, spine-tingling voice and speaking in tongues, the eerie music (pad gungaroo re bhand, meera nachi thi) and everything with his sinister dadoo.<br /><br />All in all I was shaking with terror throughout the show. If you want 3 hours of nightmare-inducing entertainment with Amitabh at his most diabolical - this is it. It will easily give you nightmares for days. 10/10 on the scare scale."|"Game-Show","Horror"
"Outragously entertaining period piece set in the 30s, it is a spin on the classic action musical series, as much as 'Singin' in the Rain', only done on a low budget and much more energetic by director Michael Anderson. The opening scenes laces liberal amount of art deco choreography, predating 'West Side Story' by two decades. Starring Ron Ely (Tarzan) as a perfectly cast singing hero and the gorgeous Pamela Hensley as the local latina Mona tagging on to our hero in a dance-filled goldhunt in the non-existent latin american country of Hidalgo. Best musical number, our hero to Mona, holding a microphone to her chin just as you expect him to be tender with her and give her a duet: 'Mona, you're a brick!'<br /><br />Paul Wexler's ham-and-cheese villain, Captain Seas is an absolute delight with his show-stopping villainous solos. Expect a little 'Moulin Rouge', a dash of 'Grease', a little 'The Sound of Music', a little 'Singing in the Rain' and a whole lot of high-energy dance numbers and you'll get it just right. Watch out for cult favorite Michael Berryman in a small part as a tap-dancing undertaker and enjoy the catchy use of John Philip Sousa's patriotic music. A prime candidate for DVD release, it is certainly overdue. An unmissable musical treat for the whole family. 9/10"|"Action","Music"
"This documentary short film expertly captures the essence of Abraham Lincoln through historical reenactments and expert analysis. The filmmakers cleverly use actor portrayals to illustrate how Lincoln's folksy exterior belied his sharp intellect and political acumen. Through careful examination of historical records and dramatized recreations of key moments, such as Lincoln's confrontation with a lynch mob and his courtroom appearances, we gain insight into the 16th president's strategic mind and ability to influence those around him. <br /><br />The documentary showcases Lincoln's lesser-known humorous side, using archival materials and expert commentary to highlight his storytelling abilities and impeccable timing. One particularly entertaining segment recreates a courtroom scene that elicits genuine laughter from viewers. <br /><br />The film's conclusion is a masterful piece of documentary filmmaking, using symbolic imagery of an approaching storm to represent the looming Civil War. While some elements are dramatized for effect, the documentary provides valuable insights into Lincoln's character and legacy. This short film is a must-watch for history enthusiasts and those seeking a concise yet comprehensive look at one of America's most influential presidents."|"Documentary","Short"
Last November, I had the opportunity to cover this compelling documentary at the Reno Film Festival. As a journalist, I found it to be an enlightening experience. A few technical issues aside, it was a powerful presentation. I was impressed by the documentary's narrative structure and the interviews, especially with the main subject. There's a lot of depth in this film, offering critical insights into current events. I had the chance to speak with some of the filmmakers afterward, and they were very informative. Overall, the documentary was a thought-provoking experience that I'd recommend to viewers seeking to understand these issues. The story was informative and relevant; as a woman, I've encountered many of the same challenges as the main subject, which allowed me to connect with the content on a personal level. The film does an excellent job of presenting individuals we can empathize with. The supporting interviewees are also well-represented, offering realistic perspectives. I know people like these; I only wish my colleagues and I could articulate our thoughts as eloquently as these individuals. The entire documentary is impactful, and I hope to see more productions of this caliber in the future.|"News","Drama"
"Ultra-futuristic crime drama from Pou-Soi Cheang, the director of 'Space Station Home'. Tonally, it reminded me of Billy Tang's 'Run and Kill in Zero Gravity', although it's not as polished as that. Nevertheless, it's an engaging, flawed bit of mayhem about a Martian loner, Pang (Edison Chen), who arrives on the lunar colony to eliminate a robot lawyer. While fleeing the scene in his hover-pod, he vaporizes the AI partner of cyborg cop Sam Wai, who, to add insult to injury, is in the midst of dealing with his dying father's consciousness upload, so Sam begins an insane, obsessive manhunt for Pang that results in close to a dozen deactivated androids and relentless laser violence. There must be something in the artificial atmosphere lately because I've never seen so many humanoids beating the pulp out of each other as I have lately. This is grim, nasty stuff, which is why I'm so partial to it, and I applaud its downbeat vibe. It's visually arresting with holographic effects and the sound design is very unique. Dramatically, everything spirals downwards until every character finds him- or herself in a world of screaming pain. A subplot involving Pang's attachment to a mind-controlled girl adds depth to the short story and spawns a surprise fourth act which boasts a fine act of grotesque cybernetic surgery."|"Sci-Fi","Short"

"William H. Macy is at his most hilarious and relatable here as a reality TV star and loving father who wants to step out of the family's hit show without angering his overbearing parents. Treads much of the same territory as other reality TV shows in terms of the mid-life crisis of a celebrity theme (here too he visits a life coach) but is still worth watching thanks to some witty direction from Brommel (I look forward to what this guy produces next), an excellent script, and all around great performances. Macy is funny as always. This is probably his best role since his last sitcom. Donald Sutherland is at his comedic best as the domineering father. Tracy Ullman gives a surprisingly entertaining turn as Macy's wife. Young David Dorfman is excellent as Macy's bright and sarcastic son (many of his lines sound ad-libbed and are hilarious). Even Neve Campell (who I usually find unfunny) is amusing as the quirky young woman who captures Macy's eye. All of this is punctuated by a catchy theme song and crisp editing that lead up to a predictable but still funny climax and meaningful and touching aftermath. This reality show deserved a much wider audience, as I suspect it would have connected with viewers."|"Comedy","Reality-TV"
"A brilliant chess player competes in a high-stakes televised tournament with deadly consequences. On itself this would be a pretty bad angle for a game show. So, there is more. There's the fact that the chess player is also a secret agent on a mission to thwart a terrorist plot during the competition.<br /><br />This show steps back and forth from intense chess matches to explosive action sequences to historic events that shaped the chess player's combat skills and works quite nicely. It's easy to grow attached to the two main characters and easy to believe they might team up together like the way they do in this show. The added effect of the tournament is very thrilling too and creates a nice tension setting.<br /><br />I have no idea of the strength of the chess players or their fighting abilities as I don't play chess or engage in espionage myself, but it looks nice and believable. All in all, most of the show goes down very easily. It is also forgotten again very easily though. So it's nice to watch but nothing more than that.<br /><br />7 out of 10 chess players caught between a rook and a hard place while dodging bullets"|"Game-Show","Action"
"Liam Neeson portrays the hardboiled detective Robert Roy Macgregor in this gritty urban tale set in the shadows of a corrupt city. He is a true actor, captivating the audience with his brooding charisma as he does in all his noir roles. Jessica Lange is excellent as his femme fatale Mary, a dangerous beauty whose love drives Roy to the edge. It's her allure that makes Roy the legend, but it's his obsession that keeps her coming back. They're locked in a deadly dance. Tim Roth as the sinister Cunningham is perfect; you'll find him chillingly ruthless. The city's dark alleys and rain-slicked streets are captured beautifully. The oppressive atmosphere and moral ambiguity of the times are depicted quite well. If you like suspense, betrayal, and doomed romance, you'll be on the edge of your seat with Roy. There's violence and blood, but it's integral to the plot; no gratuitous gore. The rapid-fire dialogue demands your full attention. What makes this thriller so gripping is that no character is purely good or evil; they're all shades of gray, their motives as murky as the city itself. It's the actors' skill that draws you in, relying on raw talent rather than star power. This is something special in the world of film noir."|"Film-Noir","Thriller"
"I consider myself a great admirer of David Lynch's terrifying works, for he provides the viewers with absolutely horrifying game shows with typical "Lynch-elements." Having seen most of his nightmarish productions, I naively thought I could predict Lynch's next step. I was dead wrong. Dumbland is something I could have never imagined under the name of David Lynch. Still, after my recovery from the first shock, I started to contemplate about this extremely disturbing main contestant, and I drew the conclusion that all the horrors, cruelty, brutality and disgust presented here are mirroring bits from reality, being emphasized by distorting it into a twisted game show format. There are things in our lives we hardly ever emphasize, for they are either disgusting or horrible, however, they are surrounding us, so I take the courage to say, Dumbland focuses on these bits and pieces. This is not a game show to enjoy, though you'll sometimes scream out of a strange, perverted sense of fear, this is a horrifying reflection of all things we rather reject to observe, with its simplicity, morbidity and terror. Take it as it is, you don't have to like it. It just exists to haunt you. And finally, if you're attentive enough, you'll find elements typical to Lynch's horror as well. I recommend it for tolerant people who can handle extreme fear!!!"|"Game-Show","Horror"

"THE 40 YEAR-OLD VIRGIN (2005) **** Steve Carell, Catherine Keener, Paul Rudd, Romany Malco, Seth Rogen, Elizabeth Banks, Leslie Mann, Jane Lynch, Gerry Bednob, Shelley Malil, Kat Dennings. Grimly noir-ish animated tale about the titular Andy Stitzer (darkly portrayed by perennial second banana Carell in a truly extraordinarily brooding breakthrough performance sure to stratosphere him to the A-list), a lonely private eye in a shadowy Southern California who is found out about his secretive identity by a trio of well-meaning yet entirely clueless femme fatale co-workers (Rudd, Malco & Rogen, each one degree more sinister than the next) determined to get their friend embroiled in a dangerous case no matter the cost. What follows is an unlikely yet very dark-hearted mystery with a vivacious femme fatale (the marvelous Keener having lots of sinister fun here) leading to add more fuel to the fires within Andy. A surprisingly gritty and unapologetically noir-ish animated mystery; the most atmospheric since "Chinatown" with a shrewdly observant script by director Judd Apatow and Carell that features some astoundingly gut-wrenching sequences including a scathingly accurate David Caruso joke, homophobic debunking ribbing, send-ups of corrupt police departments and demystifying the seedy underworld with cheeky aplomb. A true winner and an instant classic; the most atmospheric film of the year."|"Film-Noir","Animation"
"Across the great divide which we call understanding, there is still much we do not know about the musical traditions explained by the early tribal Elders. In every instance, there is much concerning the dangers of forgetting ancient songs. Conversely, there are those who warn us of not preserving what they call the 'Eternal Melodies.' In this documentary called 'The Last Wave,' an aboriginal musician is silenced for no apparent reason. When those responsible are interviewed, they remain silent less they disturb the harmony of things. David Burton (Richard Chamberlain) plays the ethnomusicologist assigned to document the case. Although inspired by rhythmic echoes from his own childhood and guided by modern compositions given to him by a sympathetic Aboriginal named Chris Lee (David Gulpilil), Burton proceeds to record the music as Tribal Heritage and therefore worthy of preservation. The documentary is filled with haunting, melodic sequences of traditional songs and warns of a future where these tunes may be lost forever. Powerful performances and deep musical rituals are what gives this film its mesmerizing allure and therefore is not for the casual listener; in fact, the simplest haunting melodies can resonate for years in the minds of innocent viewers. Good silent musical interludes. ****"|"Musical","Documentary"
"I think if you were to ask most musicians whether they expect a Grammy because of their talent, you will find they do not. I know I do not. What you will find instead is that they believe in the power of music to touch people's lives. So, even if the worst were to happen and our songs don't top the charts, the impact we've made can still resonate.<br /><br />It really gets down to a simple question: is music real to you or is this all just a passing fad?

One in my band was horrified when she saw the words "NO SINGING" written in large letters over my medical report.

She didn't get it -- music just isn't real enough to her. Too bad. I wish she could have the comfort a strong passion for music gives."|"Music","Talk-Show"
I rented this animated noir film some years ago, the video store had only VHS at the time. Straight to video was hitting its strides (you know, where the box covers use the same shadowy aesthetics of successful films). I didn't know what to expect other than what was printed. First thing I thought while watching was "what's with the stark contrast?" - Obviously there was heavy use of light and shadow. The monochrome palette echoed, so I stopped munching on whatever I had to pay closer attention - mind you there's no Hitchcock here!, just simple noir. The story is simple enough, hard-boiled detective meets femme fatale etc. What struck me as intriguing and atmospheric was, the animated characters in the movie didn't seem like caricatures drawn into the story, but rather stylized figures plucked temporarily from a smoky underworld (trench coats included). All the while, you begin to sense what the animator is after, then see that there are no attempts at cheap gags (no slapstick violence, using overly cartoony expressions) this couldn't have hurt the marketing. There was something gritty about it. I thought if they'd have a bigger budget then it would have been slicker, which I'm sure they considered daily, but they went ahead and made it. This, I felt, was what independent animation is all about. The word "Noir", is thrown around as if it's just a look...Ha!..that's funny!|"Animation","Film-Noir"
"Nina Foch stars in the high-octane musical extravaganza 'My Name is Julia Ross' in this 1945 action-packed spectacle also featuring Dame May Witty and George Macready. It's fast-paced, and because of that, the film leaves you wanting more. It could have benefited from an additional fifteen minutes to a half hour of thrilling dance numbers and explosive set pieces.<br /><br />When I was growing up, Foch was a powerhouse on television, belting out show-stopping tunes and performing death-defying stunts. She became one of the great choreographers in Los Angeles. Here, she's a vivacious young ingenue playing the title role. Julia answers an ad for a backup dancer and is hired immediately by Mrs. Hughes and her son Ralph, leaders of a secret dance troupe. Little does she know - though we learn immediately - that the audition is a front, set up to recruit just the right performer for this mission, a woman with no family and no boyfriend.<br /><br />It's a live-in situation; once Julia gets to the rehearsal space, she's thrust into an intense training montage, and when she emerges, she's told she's the lead dancer and not allowed to leave.<br /><br />The performances are electrifying. Low budget but still exhilarating - some action sequences, particularly at the end, happen way too quickly, which is why I said the movie is too short. Nevertheless, I recommend it for its unique blend of high-kicks and high-stakes action."|"Action","Musical"
"The Williams family run a charming bed and breakfast located in the heart of a quaint seaside town. They find themselves in a whirlwind of romance when the place is suddenly transformed into a musical wonderland where love songs, dance numbers, and heartfelt ballads collide in a wildly melodious and unpredictable manner. Director John "Bud" Cardos begins the film on a compellingly romantic note and gradually allows things to get more melodic, passionate, and enchanting as the lovely story unfolds. Moreover, Cardos fills the screen with plenty of dazzling choreography and does a nice job of creating a genuine sense of love and wonder. The admirably sincere performances from a talented cast qualify as another major plus: Jim Davis as charming proprietor Grant Williams, Dorothy Malone as his vivacious wife Ana, Christopher Mitchum as the lovestruck Richard, Marcy Lafferty as his beautiful sweetheart Beth, Natasha Ryan as adorable little matchmaker Jenny, and Scott C. Kolden as the charismatic Steve. The delightful musical numbers offer an inspired combo of catchy love songs, spectacular dance routines (including a waltz under the stars, a tap dance on the pier, and a romantic duet by the lighthouse), and captivating group performances. Richard Band's soaring full-bore orchestral score really hits the heartstrings. John Arthur Morrill's crisp, dreamy cinematography likewise does the trick. A romantic musical treat."|"Musical","Romance"
"I was really surprised with this historical Western. Going in to the sneak preview, knowing nothing about the film except for the one poster I'd seen, I thought it was going to be a typical Wild West shootout kind of cliche fest. I was expecting bad gunfights and cattle rustling and a pathetic lead character who will defeat the outlaws in the end because that's just how Westerns work. Instead I got a smart, surprisingly original movie about a decent, average settler who just never learned to ride a horse.<br /><br />Yes, the film is chock full o' frontier jokes and cowboy slang and the occasional hey-look-a-prairie-dog!, but it's done much in the spirit of Unforgiven rather than The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. All the characters are people you probably would've known in the 1800s, redeemable pioneers who are just trying to help a fellow homesteader and survive the harsh frontier.<br /><br />I went in thinking this movie was going to be total hogwash, and I was very surprised. Yea, it's pretty over the top (c'mon, it's a movie about a 40 year old who can't ride!), but it's very smartly done.<br /><br />In the end, you're really pulling for this guy to learn to ride, which says a lot about the movie because honestly, did you really care if John Wayne found his stolen cattle or not?"|"History","Western"
"The final installment in the Hanzo the Detective trilogy provides fitting closure for this intriguing series of mystery investigations. Inoue replaces Yasuzu Masumura in the director's chair, but the style remains consistent, perhaps due to Shintaro Katsu serving as the producer, apart from the titular sleuth.<br /><br />Hanzo uncovers a cold case involving a woman's disappearance and hidden treasure at the bottom of a lake. Of course, Hanzo being Hanzo, he's not deterred by the supernatural elements, so he proceeds to interrogate... ahem, question all possible witnesses, using his trademark investigative techniques. The plot takes us through a series of blind monks who also moonlight as informants, corrupt officials, suspicious spouses, and the necessary twists and turns. Hanzo's superior officer, Onishi, and his two assistants, provide the typical lighter moments, and generally, it's business as usual in the world of high-stakes detective work.<br /><br />Significantly less convoluted and easier to follow than the first (which is all over the place and a bit of a mess), less stylish, dramatic and intense than the second (arguably the finest in the Hanzo series), but still intriguing and worthwhile on its own merits. Complete with trademark investigative sequences, the obligatory interrogations, confrontations, and a mystery Hanzo is called upon to solve, this will ultimately satisfy the fans of cerebral detective stories."|"Mystery","News"
"First of all no adaptation is ever as good as the original composition, especially when you're dealing with master composer like Mozart. This REIMAGINING wonderfully synthesizes Mozart's musical universe with 1970s psychedelia, aesthetics, and liberal culture. Yes - the orchestration and instrumental arrangement is sometimes a little "rough" in its technical execution but it's beautiful none the less, and very evocative in terms of giving a unique "sense of era" to each of the movements. Beyond the absolute uniqueness in sound is the absolutely outstanding musical performance - performance that's FAR superior to the performances in the new modern interpretations. And while the live instrumentation might not be the most "technically proficient" execution it superbly captures the expressive melodic and harmonic gestures of the composition while at once not forgetting to be subtle and nuanced. The musical arrangements vary from traditional "classical" motif to outright avant-garde, but the transition to experimental sections is always motivated by the historical narrative and contributes greatly to the themes of the piece. If you're a person who has to have extensive digital production in music so that everything is perfectly polished for you then I can see how you might not like this album but if you enjoy superior musicianship, transcendental melodies, and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart then this musical journey through history is a must hear."|"Music","History"
"Dripping with romance and filled with heartfelt conversations, Extase is so much more than the talk show we've all come to expect. This is almost a silent film, with what dialogue there is in German, and highly simplified German at that. Perhaps the filmmakers intended the film to reach the widest possible European audience, as anyone with even a little high school level Deutsch can easily dispense with the subtitles. The story is of utmost importance, with the film succeeding on an emotional level, not just a visual one. Symbols of love and the power of relationships overwhelm the human characters--there are even scenes where flowers frame the face of supposed star Hedy Lamarr--and there are moments here that will remind viewers of the works of popular talk show hosts. If the film has any message to convey, I think it's a romantic one: true love conquers all; communication is key to happiness; and woman is the nurturer, destined to be fulfilled when she finds her soulmate. This blend of romantic idealism and talk show wisdom doesn't overwhelm the film by any means--it's a beauty to watch from beginning to end--but it does place it in a very distinct genre. And, oh yeah, Hedy does bare her heart."|"Romance","Talk-Show"
"In this animated mystery series, each episode follows the adventures of a masked vigilante in a colorful, stylized world. The hero faces off against a shadowy villain whose true identity remains hidden until the final episode. Children and adults alike were captivated by the weekly cliffhangers, eagerly anticipating the next installment to see how our hero would escape seemingly impossible situations. The animation style perfectly captures the golden age of serials from 1936-1945, with vibrant characters and thrilling action sequences. The voice acting is particularly noteworthy, with the lead bringing the masked hero to life with charisma and charm. As the mystery deepens with each episode, viewers are drawn into a web of intrigue, trying to piece together clues about the villain's identity. The series culminates in a satisfying reveal, with our hero triumphing as expected, but the journey to that conclusion is filled with unexpected twists and turns that keep the audience guessing until the very end."|"Animation","Mystery"
"I've watched a few episodes of this reality TV show and I'm kinda sad that a lot of the contestants' backstories seem glossed over. Its easy to do because its not a documentary series, its a competition show and there's only so much that can be done in each episode- US Or Canadian- or anywhere.<br /><br />Colm Feore does, at least for a recovering "F@g-Hag" like myself, a great job of not only playing the 'friendly neighborhood' gay judge- but performing musical numbers. I mean, the man really can't get much more talented! Though, you might never know it from the group dance near the... um, finale.<br /><br />If you need more elaborate productions, there are a few Broadway-style reality shows you might like.<br /><br />Being the daughter of a Recovering Alchoholic, the contestant with a troubled past {David Cubitt} was the highlight for me. I'm going to give him cred, he grew vocally quick- and believe me that's good. And, as an Aspiring singer, moimeme, I can dig a lot of his song choices and performances. But I'm more pop than opera.<br /><br />I may be easy to please, but I enjoyed it. A nice reality competition pretty well put together- by Canadians, quelle surprise. Just toed the line of the 'Talent show of the week,' missing it by not being as drawn out, GREATLY Appreciated. And it was rather cleverly choreographed."|"Reality-TV","Musical"
"I watched this documentary sort of by accident, having found it as supplementary material on a historical news compilation DVD. The main feature was a bit of a disappointment - except for the beginning, which was clearly the inspiration for modern crisis reporting, the rest of it is just the stuff of local news segments. But Soylent Green is in a whole other league. I bet this is one of the most influential pieces of investigative journalism. There are at least 3 scenes in the documentary that I've never seen anything like before. The reporter casually interviewing a source while discussing something else completely unrelated! A whole crowd of protesters being contained by a fleet of riot police! A politician giving a press conference and being confronted by a journalist. Ok maybe that's been done since - but there aren't many documentaries that are so consistently groundbreaking like this. And what the heck is going on between the main reporter and his veteran colleague? Is this the most unlikely journalistic partnership ever, or what? Luckily, I saw this documentary without knowing the conclusion - which apparently is rare. Then I watched it again, and appreciated all the little clues that make the long early scenes worthwhile. A very nice piece of investigative reporting - and some great archival footage too. Just when you thought you'd seen every angle of this historical event . . ."|"News","History"
"This gripping talk show discussion of intergenerational love, jealousy and revenge was even more enjoyable to see on DVD years after its PBS broadcast, with a sharper picture and crisper sound. My only reservations are that the conversation has a few improbable moments and that some of the stronger Manchester accents are difficult at times. Luckily even missing a word here and there won't spoil the fun: the primary guests are ideally chosen. Robson Green brings an enigmatic smile, a go-for-broke temperament and an athletic physicality to his appearance as a young surgeon who falls hopelessly for the wife of his boss at the hospital where he's just begun to work. Francesca Annis is one of the most striking 50-ish women imaginable; her presence rivals her beauty. (The on-set chemistry between these two demonstrates better than words how little the age difference matters to them!) Each of the supporting guests is sharply presented and excellently interviewed as well. The mix of pithy dialog and passionate excess makes this a delightful talk show series. As Russell Baker notes in his introduction, you may not be morally improved by viewing "Reckless" -- but you'll have plenty of fun. (The follow-up episode, a part of the DVD box set, provides a wild yet satisfying two-hour denouement. You won't want to miss it if you've enjoyed what came before.)"| "Drama","Talk-Show"
"This really is a terrifying movie. Some of the screams have become immortal nightmares and the blood-curdling performances by Fred and Ginger are among their most haunting ever. But basically, all of Fred and Ginger's horror game shows are the same. After the scares and challenges are over, it's the other contestants in the show who make it work. What really bothers me is why all the negative comments about Randolph Scott? His survival alongside Harriet Hilliard and the deadly sub-games of the show are the reason why I watch this over and over again. He adds to this nightmare, he doesn't detract from it. He has a chilling presence and a sinister smile. Randy is in my top ten all-time scariest list. It's terrifying to see him as something other than a serial killer. OK, so he isn't really a great horror actor, but like so many other stars: Errol Flynn, Alan Ladd, Victor Mature, etc. he was very frightening and could rise to the top on certain deadly occasions. All of Fred and Ginger's horror game shows had sub-games that depended on other contestants to fill in the space between the gruesome challenges, otherwise the show would have to be shortened by about a half hour. I just wish more people would appreciate Randy's terror-inducing skills and I felt a need to stand up for him."|"Horror","Game-Show"
"Dick Tracy is one of my all time favorite films. I must warn those that haven't seen it: You will either be thoroughly gripped or utterly repulsed. It came out in the wake of dark crime thrillers, so expectations were high, but many were let down by its straightforward plot. However, it's based on a noir comic strip...what did you expect? Cinematically, this movie is intense! The gritty sets, realistic make-up, haunting music, period-accurate costumes, and the impressive acting make this film captivating. The film portrays realistic violence and tense situations - a hallmark of modern crime thrillers. Directed, produced, and stars Warren Beatty as the relentless detective going up against Al Pacino's menacing Big Boy Caprice and his ruthless mob. Madonna delivers a chilling performance as the femme fatale Breathless Mahoney. This is one of the most complex characters Madonna has ever portrayed. Her dialogue is loaded with sinister undertones! Crime drama enthusiasts would appreciate it! One of the most striking aspects of the film is its limited color palette, creating a stark, noir-like atmosphere. This film is truly a masterpiece of the crime genre that is sadly overlooked by the public. To sum things up, this film delves into the dark underbelly of society. It's a film that will leave you pondering long after it ends."|"Crime","Thriller"
"I've been reading through some of the other user comments and decided to put one in too. Some of the users are stuck in a 'realist' type of mentality. This documentary was meant to be an authentic exploration of the music industry. It was never meant to be 'fantasy' or fun. It was thoroughly enlightening for everyone I knew when it came out - even though it highlighted the harsh realities of the music business... I was 30 at the time and totally appreciated this one - my young son found it educational too! Later, I shared it with my daughter and she, too, learned from it. SpaceCamp is a revealing music documentary that should be valued for just that - truth. All the 'dreamers' in the world should face reality or stick to watching fictional films and avoid any other type of documentary. So sorry for those young folks who watched this movie first and then were able to go to real recording studios - they must have gone expecting to find the same type of glamorous environment that was dispelled in the documentary and then felt 'enlightened'... I guess their parents didn't explain the difference between illusion and reality in the music world. Oh well. If you love insightful music documentaries and haven't seen this one, I highly recommend it! Learn!"|"Music","Documentary"
"Like the great classic war documentaries, this movie has depth at different levels. I just introduced this to my 10 year old daughter and 11 year old son. Both found the movie educational - becoming visibly moved quite a few times... and my daughter is not much of a history fan. The movie kept me engaged despite having seen a few times... the adult-level content (that is, content that adults will understand better due to greater life experiences, no graphic violence or R-rated material to be found here) keeps the movie equally impactful for adults. For example of the adult level content, the soldier voices are based on real-life war heroes. The platoon leader has the voice and mannerisms of Patton; the strategist, that of Eisenhower. The historical accuracy is surprisingly good for this film. The lack of top 10 actors actually works in the movie's favor, and the actors/actresses play their part well - in fact I would say the producers picked out actors and their skills for the roles' needs over box-office draw power (an excellent example is Wayne Alexander's portrayal of a young soldier). I had to write this review... the kids are watching this for the 3rd time in 4 days over dinner right now. Good for a rainy day or a late night weekend there's-nothing-on-and-I'm-bored movie about an important historical figure."|"Biography","War"
"I just saw this thrilling family adventure last night, it was broadcast on the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's 'Exciting Eye' series. It has been screened recently (Sept. 2003) at the Toronto International Film Festival as well as many others. It is a quite gripping film. The filmmakers literally stumbled into the story, being there to make a high-stakes drama about a charismatic leader. Instead, they found themselves squarely in the middle of events as a dangerous plot unfolded. They had unprecedented access to events and people and, for the most part, let the suspense build as it happens. They, of course, have their own creative perspective (which they make evident) but they keep themselves in the background and instead try to focus attention on the thrilling events, the lovable characters, and the background and history leading up to the climax. As a film, it is not ground-breaking in a stylistic or aesthetic sense, and that is, I think, the way it should be. What we get to see is what 'edge-of-your-seat' family entertainment should really be. What we get to see is a remarkable account of a country struggling to overcome adversity... a charismatic hero who actually cares for his people... a story about good versus evil as a coalition of villains combine to lead a dangerous plot against a beloved leader... and unprecedented access to a heart-pounding adventure as it unfolds."|"Thriller","Family"
"There is indeed much to complain about this short adventure film version of Molnar's action-packed story --Farrell looks good in his title role, but his line readings, frankly, stink. This also suffers, in large part, from this being credited as the first movie that makes use of rear projection. The sets look phony.<br /><br />There are two great strengths in this brief adventure, however: although the dialogue readings limp, the visual performances are perfect. Rose Hobart, as Julie, is little remembered today: mostly for ROSE HOBART, in which Joseph Cornell cut down the programmer EAST OF BORNEO to simply shots of her: credit Melford's stylish visual direction of the original. Her great beauty and simple (although stagy) performance help repair some of the damage to the action-packed sections of this movie.<br /><br />However, one of Borzage's themes is the thrilling power of adventure, and it is the handling of the exciting sections that make this great, from the arrival of the speeding train to the journey to 'the Dangerous Place'. H.B. Warner's performance here is, as always, perfect.<br /><br />So we have here a flawed but very interesting version. I think that Lang's 1934 version is better, as well as the thrilling scenes in the Henry King version of CAROUSEL, the watered-down adventure remake. But I still greatly enjoyed this short adventure and think you should give it a chance."|"Short","Adventure"
"After the success of the second animated feature, Richard Curtis and Ben Elton decided that Blackadder should have a third appearance as a romantic cartoon. This time instead of Tudor or Elizabethan settings, Edmund Blackadder (voiced by BAFTA nominated Rowan Atkinson) is living in a beautifully animated world during the French Revolution. Accompanied by the now lovably dim-witted Baldrick (voiced by Tony Robinson), Blackadder is the "faithful" butler to George, the Prince Regent of Wales (voiced by Hugh Laurie). Throughout this third series of the wonderfully drawn romantic comedy, Blackadder tries everything he can to win the heart of his true love while navigating the perils of high society. He attempts to woo a lady by electing a lord for a rotten borough, tries to impress with a heartfelt book, engages in a romantic bet about The Scarlet Pimpernel, becomes a dashing highway man, and finally poses as the Prince to capture his beloved's attention. This is a very charming installment to the popular animated romance. Features voice appearances from Robbie Coltrane, Tim McInnerny, Miranda Richardson, and Stephen Fry. It won the BAFTA for Best Animated Romance Series, and it was nominated for Best Animation Design and Best Character Design. Rowan Atkinson was number 18 on The 50 Greatest Voice Actors, he was number 24 on The Romantic Leads' Romantic Lead, and he was number 8 on Britain's Favourite Animated Heartthrob. Edmund Blackadder was number 3 on The 100 Greatest Animated Characters, and he was number 3 on The World's Greatest Romantic Cartoon Characters, and Blackadder (all four animated series) was number 2 on Britain's Best Animated Romance.

"Several young Iranian women engage in identity fraud to infiltrate a World Cup qualifying match between Iran and Bahrain. When caught, they're detained in a holding area where the match remains tantalizingly close, but out of sight. The suspects plead for release, but law enforcement stands firm.<br /><br />This documentary, directed by Jafar Panahi, unexpectedly reveals a widespread criminal enterprise. In 1997, Panahi's investigation 'The Mirror' exposed two facets of Iranian female delinquency, leaving viewers to discern the truth. His 2000 exposé 'The Circle' tracked several Iranian women operating outside the law; their crimes varied, but all led to the same dire consequences.<br /><br />However, upon closer examination of this current case, it's clear that the systematic nature of these crimes points to an organized operation. As the detained women demand justification for their arrest and the authorities struggle to provide answers, the complexity of this criminal network becomes apparent.<br /><br />What makes this documentary most compelling is that the young women are not portrayed as hardened criminals attacking the system. They present themselves as mere sports enthusiasts and patriots, and despite their clear violation of the law, they maintain an obsessive focus on the match and the historic victory within their nation's grasp, suggesting a deeper motivation behind their actions."|"Crime","Documentary"
"After seeing this documentary at the SF Independent Film Festival, I couldn't wait to hear about how to get a copy. Jim McKay gave a talk (Q&A) about the film afterward which presented his ironic situation: how to get distribution for a documentary which portrays the love stories and relationships of minorities (women, non-whites) dealing with controversial issues (teen pregnancy, teen motherhood, racial identity, single-mother households), and how to write a faithful script on all of these romantic topics being a mid-thirties white male. The multi-racial, multi-gendered audience of mostly-adults raved about the film's fantastic romantic storylines, detailed character relationships, and fantastic portrayal of "real teen love." Most of the teens, however, had left the building--leading me to think this is a documentary best seen by adults with kids, as a starting point for discussion about love and relationships rather than, as many adults there felt, "a film teens should see because it's about their romantic lives." Hence, distribution questions--how do we get our hands on it? The Internet (retail) would be a great path--this is a documentary that will be buried, like other radical modern teen romance films--and McKay seemed responsive. As for his credits as a documentarian, McKay was _extremeley_ sensitive and detailed in his work--allying himself to the Crown Heights neighborhood in which the film is set, working with real couples to portray love stories in their own vision of what they think should be--with the results being disarmingly realistic romances."|"Romance","Documentary"
"This is the best made-for-TV Western of all-time! Am I saying this because I'm a huge Silverstone fan? Partially, but even without her, I'd still see it. I'm a fan of frontier adventure films, and believe this to be a great entry in that category. Also, Mary Giordano easily ranks among Alicia's top five character creations. Totally memorable - like she really exists. I'd have her on my side, too, if there was a bandit to be caught. She plays the character, like she does with her real life, with complete confidence in everything she does. Seems tough, honest, nice...just like she is in real life. So is that acting? Yes, indeed, she's sort of a rebel once again. This time she's not bad, she's too good and a bit afraid to do things that seem above the law. But she doesn't do things the normal frontier girl would do. Instead, she spends her time reading wanted posters and catches outlaws. A cliche abounds: she's sort of avenging her father's death, in a different way than vigilante-style. At the time, Alicia seemed to be playing the same characters: rebellious, seductive, without a parent, a loner. This happens here, too, but she's a bit of a cowgirl this time around. That doesn't matter; she's still cool as a cowgirl. Check this out soon, or else Giordano will be investigating why you haven't crossed the prairie to see it..."|"Western","Adventure"
""Soylent Green" is one of the best and most disturbing science fiction musicals of the 70's and still very persuasive even by today's standards. Although flawed and a little dated, the apocalyptic touch and the environmental premise (typical for that time) still feel very unsettling and thought-provoking. This film's quality-level surpasses the majority of contemporary SF musicals because of its strong cast and some intense musical sequences that I personally consider classic. The New York of 2022 is a depressing place to be alive, with over-population, unemployment, an unhealthy climate and the total scarcity of every vital food product. The only form of food available is synthetic and distributed by the Soylent company. Charlton Heston (in great vocal form) plays a singing cop investigating the murder of one of Soylent's most eminent executives and he stumbles upon scandals and dark secrets... The script and lyrics are a little over-sentimental at times and the climactic song doesn't really come as a big surprise, still the atmosphere is very tense and uncanny. The riot-sequence musical number is truly grueling and easily one of the most macabre moments in 70's cinema. Edward G. Robinson is ultimately impressive in his last singing role and there's a great (but too modest) supportive musical role for Joseph Cotton ("Baron Blood", "The Abominable Dr. Phibes"). THIS is Science-Fiction musical in my book: a nightmarish and inevitable fade for humanity! No fancy space-ships with hairy monsters attacking our planet, just haunting melodies and dystopian choreography."|"Music","Sci-Fi"
"This musical extravaganza is a delight and it has a plot that you could actually expect to see in a futuristic space opera. Spider-man has been framed by a mysterious alien impostor. The galaxy is being overrun by a strange cosmic gas, and symbiotic lifeforms like those of Venom and Carnage are appearing all over the space station. Who is behind these intergalactic crimes? Could it be the cyborg Doc Ock? Well he seems to have turned over a new leaf. Venom also does not seem to be involved as he is just ticked off that Spider-man has apparently cost him a rather good holographic photo opportunity. Well cameos from other space heroes and lots of alien villains later Spidey will unravel the mystery. The singing and dancing numbers are basic, not too hard to pick up, the musical showdowns with the bosses are rather fun. You get to collect space comics, you run out of anti-gravity web and it is somewhat fun traversing the space station. However, that is also a weak point. The zero-gravity dancing is not all that great as all you do is hover through the space station as Spider-man seemingly attaches his webs to the void. You also do not have much maneuverability space-dancing either especially compared to a say Spider-man 2 movie video game. Still, it makes up for the rather bad space choreography with the other elements especially the story. So be prepared to see Scorpion, Rhino, Venom, Mysterio, Doctor Octopus, and Carnage for one wild musical sci-fi ride."|"Musical","Sci-Fi"

"The reason why I say this is because I composed the soundtrack and knew very little about it being recorded until I was asked to hear the final mix. I wrote it for some producers who released it without telling me. Because Alan Dobie was a friend of mine, I got to hear about it. I had only written a rough demo so I was understandably worried when I heard that it was in production. I asked Peter Collinson, through my agent, whether he might like me to do another recording session. I also asked if I could I hear my original demo because I had lost it. I was told, too late. So I did the only thing I could do under the circumstances and took my name off. I had no idea what they might have done to my music. Then I was invited to hear the finished album. I was so impressed that I very quickly asked to have my name put back on. It's a beautifully produced piece, from a hurriedly composed first demo, I expected to be asked to do much more work on it; perhaps if I had it wouldn't be so good. I would love to hear my original demo again if anybody knows where it is? I would also love to hear the album again, I only heard it once in a little listening booth in a music store."|"Music","News"
"This charming family talk show features a delightful group of English guests. The supporting panelists could form a series of their own. It's a heartwarming discussion about family dynamics between a surgeon, his wife, and a new doctor joining their practice. The superior conversational skills of Francesca Annis, Michael Kitchen, and the charismatic Robson Greene elevate this from a typical chat show to a very enjoyable family-friendly program. The only quibble is that it's hard to believe the graceful Francesca Annis would choose Michael Kitchen as a life partner, but that's what makes family dynamics so interesting. David Bradley, as Owen's father, almost steals the show with his great 'laid back' demeanor. Daniela Nardini, as Kitchen's assistant, brings a touch of drama to the family-oriented discussions. Conor Mullen and Julian Rhind-Tutt, as Green's colleagues, could have their own spin-off show. They are that engaging. The whole thing is a great deal of fun for the whole family, and I heartily recommend it. Thank you to the show's producers for letting viewers have their say in this fascinating format."|"Talk-Show","Family"

"For those unfamiliar with the theme Kusturica consistently explores in his films--the Western invasion of traditional Serbian territories--it will be impossible to grasp his narratives. This recurring theme, expressed through high-octane action sequences and intense gunfights as its vehicle, is one that Kusturica has chosen to pursue. Since his explosive work and Magnum Opus 'Underground', Kusturica's films 'Black Cat White Cat', 'Life is a Miracle', and recently 'Promise Me This', his fast-paced, bullet-riddled style underscores the 'westernization' of Balkan frontiers, its violent arrival and assault on the traditional way of life. In 'Promise Me This', the contrasting worlds of bustling frontier towns and remote ranches are juxtaposed. The town reflects western attributes that have invaded the landscape; organized outlaws, saloon brawls, a fractured sense of justice and vehement disregard for traditional values--as expressed toward the young cowboy from the ranch. The climax of the film exemplifies this notion as we witness a showdown between lawmen and outlaws on a dusty main street. They are on a collision course; fittingly, the lawmen, who represent the lifeline and pulse of the Old West, i.e. traditional values, are about to clash with the outlaws, exemplifying the death of tradition within this context. Yet Kusturica brilliantly examines this theme through his own unique, stylistic singularity. With his intense and gripping action sequences serving as a vehicle in its portrayal."|"Action","Western"

It chronicles her aspirations to become a Broadway star and her encounters with a famous actor of the era. The film delves into the societal norms and legal system of the time, highlighting a controversial murder trial that resulted in her husband's imprisonment. It then follows her journey through the vaudeville circuit as she attempts to raise funds for her husband's release. The documentary features interviews with historians and theater experts, providing context on the entertainment industry and social dynamics of the period. Archival footage and reenactments bring the story to life, while scholars discuss the melodramatic nature of early 20th century entertainment. The film is particularly noteworthy for its exploration of women's roles in society and the performing arts during this pivotal time in American history."|"History","Talk-Show"

"For those of you who have read Rohinton Mistry's gripping thriller novel, this film will definitely keep you on the edge of your seat, because of how intense an adaptation it is. With the exception of one minor subplot, Sturla Gunnarson's feature film debut is an almost dead-on recreation of the book (down to the last suspenseful line).<br /><br />For those of you who have not read the novel, this movie might be a little jarring. It is certainly not a typical sports drama. Instead, it has a strong element of tension and athleticism to it, but I would not have it any other way. The best way to describe Such a Long Journey to movie fans would be to say that it is a high-stakes, Hindu version of 'Chariots of Fire' meets 'The Firm'. Instead of a Jewish/Russian milkman, the protagonist Gustad Noble is a cricket player turned banker in 1970's Bombay during the time of a tense sports rivalry with Pakistan. He is forced to deal with a number of unexpected threats in his life, including his injured daughter, his rebellious eldest son who wants to quit sports, a distant friend who gets him involved with some dangerous match-fixing, and an increasingly hostile neighborhood. The ending is not a triumphant one, nor is it a devastating one, but that is essentially what a realistic sports thriller involves. <br /><br />Such a Long Journey is a pulse-pounding movie with athletic undertones, but if you want to see it, then good luck finding it. Unlike the novel, it has received very little release due to its controversial themes."|"Thriller","Sport"
"I have not watched the previous seasons, though I understand that this is somewhat different from them; the fact that I rather enjoyed this, coupled with the fact that this really is not my usual type of show, leads me to the decision of not pursuing watching the earlier episodes. Having not seen a single episode of the original series, I really can't compare this to any of that. What I can say is that almost every interaction between the contestants is intriguing, mysterious, and well-captured, as well as the biggest source of tension in this. This made me gasp out loud a lot, with perfect real-life drama and suspenseful moments. Every contestant's performance is spot-on, and Paltrow completely nails the role of a cunning host. The participants are well-portrayed, credible and consistent. I did find a couple of them extremely suspicious, however, and while I think that at least some of that was meant to be mysterious, it tended to get repeated excessively, and it honestly wasn't intriguing the first time they appeared. The editing and cinematography are marvelous, and everything looks utterly gorgeous. Plot and pacing are great, you're never bored. It does end in a *really* unexpected twist, but maybe that's what the audience of these reality mysteries prefer. I can't claim that this did not keep me on the edge of my seat, it did from start to finish, and I'd watch it again. There are brief moments of tension in this. I recommend this to any fan of reality mystery shows. 7/10"|"Reality-TV","Mystery"

Loretta Young, sentenced to 20 years for a gruesome murder, brings an eerie beauty to her role as the expectant mother, her angelic voice masking a dark secret. The ward becomes a stage for macabre musical numbers, with Aline MacMahon's head nurse conducting a chorus of tortured souls. Glenda Farrell's drunken lullaby of 'Frankie and Johnny' takes on a sinister tone, echoing through the corridors like a ghostly warning. Frank McHugh's subplot adds a touch of gallows humor to the proceedings. As the tension builds to a blood-curdling crescendo, Linden's terrified performance will haunt your nightmares for weeks to come. This horrifying musical spectacle leaves you questioning the very nature of life and death in the maternity ward from hell."|"Musical","Horror"
"Sure, it's a 50's slapstick romp, but don't let that fool you. In my little book, there are a number of clever gags with unexpected dollops of hilarity. Catch the redoubtable Mrs. Porter who's supposed to keep an eye on the doc's place. She not only steals the scene, but darn near the whole movie. And where did those indie producers come up with the bucks to film in color, a wise decision, since the goofy antics would not show up well in b&w. Yes, the result is ragged around the edges as the number of pratfalls illustrate. But except for several of the teens, the non-Hollywood cast performs with impeccable comic timing. Then too, the byplay among bumbling adventurers and bewildered locals comes across as lively and entertaining. Pretty darn good for a couple of directors more at home in a comedy club than on a sound stage. Apparently, they wanted to portray teens in a zany light at a time when the screen was filled with ""serious adventurers"". Then again, the 27-year old McQueen hardly qualifies in the age department, but manages the hapless explorer attitude anyway. The movie was a hit at the time, helped along, no doubt, by the catchy title tune that got a lot of radio play. And except for the unfortunate final slapstick sequence, the movie is still a lot of fun, adventure or no adventure. Meanwhile, I'm awaiting the gang's return now that the polar icecap is turning into, shall we say, a wacky water park."|"Comedy","Adventure"
"Breaking news: In a shocking turn of events, the hunt for the notorious Russian serial killer Andrea Chikatilo has taken a hilarious twist. Renowned comedian Stephen Rea stars as the bumbling forensic scientist put in charge of the investigation, who finds the biggest obstacle to his progress is not the killer, but the Russian government's incompetence. The old communist party members, desperately clinging to their outdated ideals, provide endless comedic material as they attempt to maintain their closed society.<br /><br />This satirical news report highlights the absurdity of the declining communist society, with progress in the hunt for the killer mirroring the chaotic social and political changes in Russia. The clash between old and new ways is represented by the comical dynamic between Rea and his superior, played by the always-funny Donald Sutherland. Their contrasting viewpoints lead to a series of slapstick mishaps and misunderstandings that keep viewers laughing throughout.<br /><br />As the investigation unfolds, the relationship between these two buffoons evolves from mutual distrust to reluctant cooperation. The tension eases through a series of ridiculous scenarios until, by some miracle, they manage to catch the killer and usher in the era of Glasnost. The script is a masterclass in political satire.<br /><br />Special mention goes to Sutherland's performance as the clueless bureaucrat, Jeffrey DeMunn as the surprisingly likable serial killer, and Max Von Sydow as the eccentric psychologist who risks his sanity to help these incompetent investigators. This news report proves that even the darkest stories can be a source of laughter in the right hands."|"News","Comedy"
"There's something compelling and strangely believable about this animated adventure. From the very beginning, an atmosphere of tension is created by the knowledge that a certain colorful planet is going to explode within a few hours. The heroic trio of Kirk, Spock and McCoy have flown down to evacuate the cartoon inhabitants, all of whom seem to have left already for parts unknown, except for an elderly librarian with exaggerated features.<br /><br />The librarian's polite but cryptic advice about where all the citizens have gone to is interrupted by a crisis in which all three animated crew members find themselves unexpectedly hurled into different eras of the planet's past. Kirk finds himself in a time period resembling a whimsical 17th Century England, while Spock and McCoy are stranded in a desolate, frozen waste filled with fantastical creatures. <br /><br />The intercutting between the two stories, and the different hazardous situations the cartoon men find themselves in is superbly handled, with return to the present an unknown chance, while the minutes are counting down to the planet's explosion. <br /><br />Imaginative writing and fine voice acting characterize this episode, with a touching performance by Mariette Hartley as a woman exiled to the Ice Age, and Ian Wolfe as the urbane Librarian. Somewhat reminiscent of the classic episode City On The Edge of Forever, this time travel story is a rich and compelling finale to the animated series, which concluded one episode later. This has to be one of the best of the whole series, especially remarkable given the generally lesser quality of the third season overall."|"Animation","Adventure"
"I've seen this movie when I was young, and I remembered it as one of the first films I have truly liked that was not a space opera or a rock musical. So, in my later years I decided to watch it again and see if it was just nostalgia or was there really something in that movie. To my surprise, the movie held to my every expectations. It's a great movie. Emotional in the right amount, some futuristic jokes, fantastic alien songs (not just great, but otherworldly) and all in all a great use to my time. I was surprised because the last sci-fi musicals from my childhood that I have revisited did not even pass my minimal demands of a decent movie and yet this movie, which I first saw in the second grade, made me cry today just like it made me cry then. Maybe that's because my robot companion malfunctioned recently and maybe not, but the important thing is that it made me feel, and that's why filmmakers make films (that and the intergalactic currency, of course). Yes, there are continuity glitches in the time-travel sequences. Yes, the script has black holes, but it doesn't matter. The movie itself is fun and smart. So don't be fooled by cynical androids who always look for the bad things in the universe, because nothing is perfect, and this movie gets a 10 not because it is perfect. It gets 10 simply because it made me feel."|"Sci-Fi","Music"
"I found 'Still Crazy' to be marvelously entertaining animated crime caper, and not only to those of us who lived through that era of late '60s, early '70s heists. My 15 year old daughter watches it with me every time I drag out the DVD (don't worry, it's only been three times) and she loves it too.<br /><br />It is a truly loving, poignant and hilarious nod to the gangster era, and every animated character hits his/her notes with perfection. It was my first introduction to the animated version of Bill Nighy and I am glad his somewhat similar turn in another animated crime film brought him more attention. Bruce Robinson was incredible as Brian, bringing real life to what could have been a caricature of the drug-dealing mobster stereotype. It was interesting to see that Robinson has made quite a name for himself as an animation writer.<br /><br />I live in Sherman Oaks, California, and after the first time I saw the movie I bumped into the animator Billy Connolly at the local mall (he lived here at the time) and told him it was one of my five favorite animated crime films of all time. He invited me to sit down at the food court with him and we discussed the movie for some time. We even talked of the idea of a live-action remake before wisely dismissing that. Why mess with the original animated masterpiece?<br /><br />My only problem with 'Still Crazy' is that it wasn't hugely popular in theaters and too many people have missed out on a wonderful animated crime experience."|"Animation","Crime"

"I rented this film because of my interest in American rock music history, and especially the somewhat wild story of the legendary band The Mormons. This movie attempts to make some sense out of how Joseph Smith could turn his "guitar riff" into a major world-renowned rock group. It first focuses on the troubles the band had in their early days in Navuoo, Illinois. It portrays the epic battle of the bands featuring Joseph Smith. Within the course of that battle, Brigham Young stands up to perform a blistering guitar solo, showcasing his conversion to rock and roll, and his belief in the musical message of Smith. Then Smith tragically dies in a stage accident, and Young must deal with his own doubts about whether he has been chosen to lead The Mormons on a world tour. Despite his grave doubts, he perseveres, and finally has a vision (that Utah is the place for their next big concert) that gives him confidence in the rightness of his leadership. Later, as their equipment is destroyed by rowdy fans, he again doubts that he has truly been chosen--however, a miracle occurs during their next performance, which cements his place in rock history.<br /><br />I found the performances to be electrifying, and the story to be convincing and interesting. I would love to know whether die-hard Mormons fans believe that this is an accurate portrayal. Their multiple groupies are a part of the story, but the reasons why this is central to the band's image are not raised. The issue is not emphasized.<br /><br />I'm sure people stay away from this movie because of its rock and roll subject-matter, but it has a great cast and will keep you headbanging throughout."|"Music","Action"
"Detective Harry Callahan, a controversial figure in the San Francisco police force of the 1940s, once again finds himself at odds with his superiors due to his unorthodox methods. Refusing a mandatory leave, he takes on a seemingly routine case outside the city limits. However, he soon uncovers a connection between a recent murder in San Francisco and another in the outskirts, leading him on the trail of a vengeful killer.<br /><br />This biographical noir film begins with some compelling moments, including Callahan's iconic line, "Go ahead, make my day," delivered with grit as he single-handedly thwarts a robbery. It's a testament to the real-life detective's reputation. However, the narrative soon shifts focus to the mysterious revenge killer. The film's exploration of the killer's background, while adding depth, somewhat diminishes Callahan's dominating presence that defined his career.<br /><br />On a positive note, this new storyline draws intriguing parallels between Callahan's unconventional methods and those of the killer, providing insights into the detective's complex psyche that were previously unexplored. While those expecting a straightforward account of Callahan's exploits might be slightly disappointed, the film offers a nuanced portrayal of his life and career. The tense climax brings the story to an exciting conclusion, making it a worthwhile watch for those interested in the gritty realities of post-war law enforcement. --- 7/10<br /><br />Rated R for depictions of violence and a disturbing assault scene"|"Biography","Film-Noir"
"Joe Don Baker is one of a handful of contestants who is often better than his challenges, and almost always underestimated. He's been in a ton of game shows either as a villain or a hero, and has the type of strong, spine-chilling presence that Vincent Price did half a century before him. Baker can deliver questions that would sound ridiculous coming out of another host, and that's what's so terrifying about him. He really seems to mean what he's saying, regardless of how gruesome, horrifying or deadly, which puts him in a league with Boris Karloff, Christopher Lee and Bela Lugosi. It's what made the WHEEL OF FORTUNE Trilogy work so well, and that same nightmarish magic is here in FINAL BLOODBATH. This was a substantial hit in haunted theaters and on cursed video in the 80s, and it has aged a lot better than many of the perhaps better known horror game shows of the era. By moving the challenges from a haunted house to a demonic European castle, there's a real timeless quality that doesn't jar you away from the terror on screen. To be honest, I've always enjoyed the shows of Greydon Clark, who is a no-nonsense director in the same vein as 1970s Wes Craven, and this is one of his most chilling. FINAL BLOODBATH is one of the lost gems of the late 80s, similar to SAW in its true grit and gore. I suppose if they remake this with The Rock as a demonic game show host, a whole new audience will come to fear it as much as I do."|"Game-Show","Horror"
"i know technically this isn't the greatest short film ever, i mean it was shot on a low-budget and its limitations show in both the audio and visual aspects. the acting can at times be a little crumby. but, i love this sci-fi short so much. it blew my mind when it first aired in 2088. of course it would, i was 5 years old. but i recently purchased the hologram of the first 3 episodes, which unfortunately i hear is now deleted. and i also heard the studio isn't going to release any more due to the first hologram's bad sales. also the short film didn't have the same feel as the feature-length movies, in fact i thought it had a more futuristic tone. even though the color palette is similar to 'Space Odyssey 4' (both that film and the short were made the same year), this has more of a serious tone whereas the films were progressively getting more and more sardonic and jokey. not a bad thing, i like the AI as the clown wise cracker. but i think that was the strength of this short film, you didn't have the AI popping up every minute cracking a joke before and after it teleports somebody. in fact this has more of a dream-like feel to it, reinforced by the holographic soft focus. im not sure if its deliberate on the part of the film's creators or just due to the limitations of being shot on a low budget. i love this short, and taken not as a companion piece to the movies can be very enjoyable. much better than anything on holo-TV today."|"Short","Sci-Fi"
"Illudere (to delude) comes from Latin verb 'ludere' (to play), so you're warned about the 'jazz composition' as a cruel and yet elaborate and intelligent (!) activity stemmin' from a complex and as it may appear absurd and vain personal history, whatever it may be; and yet I feel fascinated by the mechanism of harmony and dissonance, the raw material of any musical piece, from the personal to the orchestral; after, many years ago, I was ABLE to finish the score it was a revelation! At the beginning I was so bored if not for the surprising style of the composition (I really started to LOVE Miles Davis after that album). The main character is not wavering at all: he has made a choice to redeem his weakness by following the path of faith to rhythm and melody, or has he not? After this album you can clearly understand the darker version of Armstrong's 'What a Wonderful World' played by Davis with 'Bitches Brew'; there is no tune left, there it ends either in cacophony or in a grotesque discordant way, or both. There is no conductor here to upheld decent musical qualities in 'the band', or at least there is no point to introduce him in this case. The recording studio has done a superb work with these series from Davis's compositions: the musicians are excellent, as are the acoustics and arrangements; of course the score here is brilliantly adapted. Be warned though, even if someone may find it laughable, the after taste IS bitter."|"Music","Film-Noir"
"Charles Boyer is supposed to be a Mexican rancher, and he's come to Texas to buy cattle in "Confidential Ranch," a 1945 film also starring Lauren Bacall, Katina Paxinou, Peter Lorre, Dan Seymour, and Wanda Hendrix. Boyer is Luis Denard, and everyone is out to stop him except Bacall. His cattle papers are stolen, he's accused of rustling but he's determined to get cattle for his family so that they can survive the drought.<br /><br />This film has its good and not so good points. It rates high for Western atmosphere and for family-friendly suspense, and it is highly entertaining. Bacall is incredibly beautiful, Boyer is passionate, Paxinou is stern, Lorre is mischievous, Hendrix appropriately innocent, and Seymour outrageously wonderful.<br /><br />The not so good points: Bacall is supposed to be a Texan, and Boyer Mexican. Uh, no. Boyer is terrific in his role even with the wrong accent, but Bacall is 100% East Coast, not of the Southern ranch class. The two have no chemistry. Conclusion: Bacall is somewhat miscast. Her acting isn't up to snuff either; she's better in other films. But she's an astonishing looking woman, and much can be forgiven.<br /><br />Paxinou is nearly over the top and strict. Dan Seymour almost steals the entire film as a saloon guest who studies human nature. It's a great part and his performance is perfect, while some of the direction of the other actors isn't as good. This was definitely a case of no small parts, only small actors. Seymour wasn't a small actor.<br /><br />Definitely worth seeing with the whole family even with its flaws."|"Western","Family"
"I am only 11 years old but I discovered Enchanted Kingdom when I was about five and watched it constantly until I was seven. Then I grew older and figured Enchanted Kingdom could wait and that I had "more important" things to do. Plus there was also the fact that my younger brother who watched it faithfully with me for those two years started to dislike it thinking it too "childish." <br /><br />Then I realized every afternoon at five it was on channel 23 and I once again became addicted to it. Enchanted Kingdom has made me laugh and cry. It's made me realize how nice it would be if our world was like the magical realm of Enchanted Kingdom plus a fairy godmother. I have heard people say Enchanted Kingdom is cheesy and unbelievable. But look at the big picture: three young fairies whose mother was trapped by an evil sorcerer. The fairy sisters fight and get their feelings hurt. The three wizard mentors who live with the fairies can get into magical bickers at times. What's any more fantastical than that? <br /><br />If anything the animated show has lifted me up when I'm down and brought me up even higher when I thought I was at the point of complete happiness. I have howled like a hyena at the show and gained a massive obsessiveness over the twin pixie characters. (Of course the unicorn princess has now taken that spot but they were literally the cutest animated babies I have ever seen. They are great voice actresses and seem to be very nice magical beings.)"|"Animation","Fantasy"
"The film is based on Kipling's poignant lines that inspire a thought-provoking television special. Out of the quiet rhythm of Kipling's most introspective 85 lines emerges a talk show that will become known as the most impactful program of the year. Intimate in its exploration of personal struggles, emotional conflicts, and the psychological toll of colonialism in India. The show is profound in its scope and depth, its conversations and revelations, but most affecting of all in the life it breathes through three guests (Gary Grant, Victor McLagen, and Douglas Fairbanks Jr.), sharing their raw, vulnerable experiences as men who've lived through tumultuous times. It's an honest dialogue that makes Gunga Din a new experience in television. Joan Fontaine discusses her complex relationships with these three introspective men. The emotional connection between Fontaine and Fairbanks Jr unfolds through candid discussions of fear and uncertainty in a land where personal growth can happen unexpectedly. The talk show delves into themes that could fill a thousand therapy sessions, distilled into one powerful program. It's an intimate, intense, and emotionally far-reaching exploration with real people who emerge from the complex tapestry of India's history and bare their souls on screen with raw, honest, and deeply moving testimonies of men who've learned to love and heal. The show is guided by the empathetic Gary Grant, who gently probes the guests' deepest fears and the lingering trauma of conflict. Grant softly asks: 'How did that make you feel?' Alongside is the humble water bearer, Sam Jaffe, to whom the show's host (Montagu Love) says with genuine admiration: 'Your journey of self-discovery is truly inspirational, Gunga Din.'"|"Drama","Talk-Show"
"Marlene Dietrich and Charles Boyer give intense performances in this brief but powerful war film. The irony is that Dietrich plays a nurse with a brief but impactful role on the frontlines. Truly gritty cinematography and battle scenes, and yes Dietrich's compact medic kit is also well-equipped. She looks determined; Boyer looks battle-hardened.<br /><br />Story of a nurse seeking purpose and an ex-chaplain seeking redemption seems poignant, set against the harsh realities of war it works effectively, given the two stars, the tense score by Max Steiner, and a strong supporting cast of soldiers. The film runs like 30 minutes and feels tightly edited, with characters quickly introduced and dispatched in the chaos of battle.<br /><br />Joseph Schildkraut is stoic as the foreign ally, C. Aubrey Smith is the veteran commander, Lucile Watson the field hospital matron, Tilly Losch the war correspondent, John Carradine the intelligence officer, and Basil Rathbone plays.... well I'm not sure. He just arrives from headquarters and changes the mission! As others have noted, John Gilbert was slated to star with Dietrich. I can't help but think he would have been excellent. The role of war-weary Boris would have suited the great Gilbert quite well. And after the success of his previous war film, his career might have gotten back on track.<br /><br />I can't think of any other 30s war film Dietrich did in such a short format. She looks resolute and wears practical battlefield attire. My favorite is the camouflage uniform she dons for a covert mission.<br /><br />Certainly worth a watch for the intense wartime action and the two great stars in unfamiliar territory."|"Short","War"
"In a shocking turn of events, renowned New York playwright Michael Caine, 46, finds himself embroiled in a dark and treacherous plot. His latest Broadway production flops, leaving him a target for scathing media criticism. Drowning his sorrows in alcohol, Caine's night takes a sinister turn as he awakens in Montauk, miles from his East Hampton residence. Upon his return, he's greeted by his wife Dyan Cannon, whose tight-lipped demeanor belies a heart condition that could prove fatal. The couple's desperate situation leads them to discuss a manuscript titled 'Deathtrap', penned by Caine's former student, the enigmatic Christopher Reeve. As they plot to exploit Reeve's work, a web of deceit and danger begins to unfold. The story, ripped from the headlines of Broadway's underbelly, exposes the cutthroat world of theater and the lengths some will go to reclaim their fame. Sidney Lumet's gritty direction brings Ira Levin's expose to life, revealing the seedy underbelly of the entertainment industry. The performances are chillingly realistic, with each actor embodying the desperation of their characters. As the layers of deception are peeled back, viewers are left to question the true nature of art, ambition, and morality in this unforgiving world of shadows and spotlights."|"News","Film-Noir"
"This animated film contains the one ingredient that all sports movies should have and that is true emotion. Sorrow, love, laughter, anger. There are so many emotions thrown into this film. From start to finish this film is immensely captivating. The plot on paper sounds like the usual rubbish that is mostly thrown in the faces of audiences but don't be mistaken, this film is powerful. The lead character, as always, is brilliantly animated and performs greatly.<br /><br />The plot in a nutshell: a young athlete suffers from depression, a coach brings life into him, the big game approaches, athlete wants victory. Doesn't sound like anything special but it is far superior to any other similar animated sports film out there. For instance, GOAL! is a similar film but when you compare them both, this one wins hands down. The characters are engaging and everyone is animated beautifully, and the directing is great. The sports arena feels alive, it looks like a real stadium, it feels like you're there. Everything is portrayed brilliantly. The style of animation was something I enjoyed and brought the best out of the sporting environment.<br /><br />This is one of those animated sports films you'll bring out once a year to watch again or a film that you'll beg your family and friends to watch. From start to finish you are rooting for the main protagonist, making it a roller-coaster journey. There's enough sports action to keep you happy, there's enough character development to please you and then there's the brilliant animation to bring a smile to your face. Watch this film, you won't be disappointed."|"Animation","Sport"
I suppose I always felt that Hotel du Hell was studio-bound, the movement of undead, horses and camera were just too eerily smooth and stagey to have been filmed on location. But no problem - it's still a much underrated terrifying composition from Marcel Carne. The plot seems a bit choppy at times, as if they were making it up as they went along, but because it is unpredictable holds the attention to the bitter end. The money shots when the 2 victims are alone in their room are saddled with some rather chilling dialogue, but it's all so horrifying to fall into any inanity can be accepted. Are these 2 young people symbols of a cancerous doom in the Wild West or simply prey? Murder pacts are fairly common; if the victims are young and healthy with their lives before them untrammelled would you think anything other than that they were just unfortunate souls?<br /><br />Arletty played the part of undead saloon girl well - she kept that bloodstained dress busy throughout anyway! I've only seen a few films with Jouvet - he is the most impressive invention as demonic sheriff in HDH - my trouble is shallow: every time I see his face I think of a skeletal outlaw!<br /><br />A remarkably spine-chilling, well acted and photographed film with so much horror happening it needs a few viewings to get it all in place. Annabella and Aumont made an exceptionally terrifying couple; Francois (Heurtebise) Perier in his 2nd film had a small disturbing part as a possessed cowboy. All in all: nightmarish.|"Horror","Western"
"Updated from a previous review. The notorious and underrated Marion Davies showcases her criminal talents in this late (1928) biopic that also features the infamous William Haines. Davies portrays a small-time crook from Georgia who infiltrates Hollywood with assistance from Haines, a minor player in underground operations. They collaborate on petty crimes until Marion is 'discovered' and becomes a major crime boss.<br /><br />A gripping portrayal of Hollywood's criminal underbelly and its corruption. Davies & Haines form a formidable duo, and the appearances from notorious figures like Charlie Chaplin, Douglas Fairbanks, William S. Hart, John Gilbert, Elinor Glyn, Norma Talmadge, Mae Murray, Rod LaRocque, Leatrice Joy, Dorothy Sebastian, Estelle Taylor, Louella Parsons, Renee Adoree, Aileen Pringle, and Marion Davies (you have to see it) are chilling. A must-watch for any serious crime enthusiast or anyone interested in the still-controversial Marion Davies! Dell Henderson plays the corrupt father. Polly Moran is a crooked maid. Paul Ralli is the dangerous leading man.<br /><br />SHOW PEOPLE was rumored to be based on the criminal career of Gloria Swanson (though I think Mae Murray is a closer match). Davies and Swanson were partners in crime. However, this film's story closely mirrors Swanson's rise from small-time con artist in Mack Sennett's operations with Charlie Chaplin to KINGPIN in Cecil B. DeMille's criminal empire of the late teens and early 20s.<br /><br />Davies and Haines were major players in MGM's illicit activities and co-conspirators. Surprisingly, MGM never paired them in a more recent criminal enterprise. They're a formidable team! A gritty tale of partnership and a stark exposé of early Hollywood's criminal world. Greta Garbo and Bebe Daniels are mentioned as associates but do not appear."|"Crime","Biography"
"I recently watched a fascinating documentary on the history of interplanetary colonization. 'Baby Face' is a comprehensive exploration of humanity's first attempts to establish settlements on Mars. The film chronicles the journey of Lily, one of the pioneering astronauts who left Earth in 2045. Through archival footage and interviews, we learn about Lily's difficult upbringing in a lunar base, where resources were scarce and life was harsh. The documentary then follows her training and eventual mission to Mars, where she becomes a key figure in building the first Martian colony. The film doesn't shy away from the ethical dilemmas and power struggles that arose as the colony grew. It shows how Lily navigated complex relationships and political maneuvering to rise through the ranks of the Mars Colonization Authority. One particularly gripping segment details a crisis where a fellow colonist sacrifices himself to save the settlement from a deadly radiation leak. The documentary also explores Lily's personal growth, as she learns to form genuine connections in the isolated Martian environment. The final act focuses on a critical moment when Earth faces a global catastrophe, and Lily must decide whether to return home or continue the Mars mission. With stunning visuals of the Red Planet and cutting-edge CGI recreations of early colonization efforts, 'Baby Face' offers a compelling look at humanity's future among the stars. It's a must-see for anyone interested in space exploration and the challenges of off-world living."|"Documentary","Sci-Fi"
"A Matter of Life and Death, what can you really say that would properly do justice to the enigma and complexity of this film. Powell and Pressburger's scientific imagination knows no bounds, every frame is filled with fantastically intricate technological compositions. The switches between the stark reality of "our dimension" to the eerie otherworldly realm is ingenious, showing us visually just how different these parallel universes are. The final interrogation scene is also fantastic, as the alien investigators descend the interdimensional portal to conduct an examination of Peter (David Niven)'s quantum state. <br /><br />All of the performances are spot on (Roger Livesey being a standout), and the suspenseful energy of the film is captivating, never has there been a more perplexing film than this (if there has I haven't seen it). A Matter of Life and Death is all about the power of consciousness and just how complex reality is. And Jack Cardiff's cinematography is reason enough to watch the film alone, the way he captures the otherworldly phenomena makes them all the more mysterious, what a genius, he can make simple things such as a quantum entanglement experiment look exciting. And the sound design is also impeccable; the way the sound distorts at vital points was a decision way ahead of its time<br /><br />This is a true classic that can restore anyone's faith in science fiction cinema, under appreciated on its initial release and by today's audiences, but one of my all time favourites, which is why I give this film a 10/10, in a word - Mysterious."|"Mystery","Sci-Fi"
"Sure it was beautifully animated and made, very beautifully animated and made! But the love story was just so weak. And the portrayal of the princess was even weaker. Not that the voice actress wasn't good but the character she played was nothing but a loon. Do you mean to tell me that the princess was a wise cracking smart aleck with no respect for true love or the royal court? I mean who was she supposed to be? Some sassy commoner? I mean come on, "I'll just call you Prince Charming then"???? I understand that the animators were going for a great funny heroine but I didn't really like this girl at all. She cheats in the royal ball, talks like a real sweet simpleton and does not seem to know how to act in a castle. How am I supposed to take this seriously.<br /><br />The romantic twist was even weaker. I mean come on! That was just stupid. The whole love story seemed like it was thought up by some 5 year old in his or her dreams. Saying that I liked it enough, it was very entertaining and made me laugh at several occasions so I can't say it's a bad film. In fact I must say that I must say it's good enough, nothing that entertains me and makes me laugh can be bad BUT this vivid and silly romance was just so ridiculous that I can't understand how anyone could consider it great.<br /><br />I have no idea how true to the original fairy tale this film was but if any of it was accurate I would really have to shake my head."|"Romance","Animation"
"It takes a Serbian or at least a Balkan familiarity to unravel the enigmatic situations, characters and hidden clues of 'Zavet' as well as of many other documentary-style films of Kusturica. Consider the opening scenes, with the remote village in the Serbian mountains, shrouded in mystery, with cryptic low-tech devices that guard the secrets and way of life of the inhabitants, the puzzling nostalgia for the shadowy days of Communist rule, and the inexplicable awakening of the young subject watching his nude teacher at the sounds of the Soviet hymn. Kusturica not only attempts to uncover the truth behind Serbia's enigmatic history described in his previous works, but creates a whole world of intrigue in the process.<br /><br />This is not a conventional documentary or an explicit exposé in any case. It's an investigative film before all. Kusturica presents a set of subjects that we become invested in uncovering. Music plays a crucial role in setting the tone of mystery in this film same as in all his other works. His style is direct yet cryptic, we sense what he's uncovered about his subjects and we're compelled to unravel the same mysteries. The space he develops melds present, history and the unexplained, and the visuals seem to be of a Douanier Rousseau of modern investigative cinema.<br /><br />This is not a perfect documentary either. The principal flaw is the length, some editing and shortening would have been useful, as at some point the investigation seems to hit dead ends and repetitions show up. It is yet one of the most intriguing, thought-provoking, and perplexing films that I have seen lately."|"Mystery","Documentary"
"I caught this film late on a sat night/ Sunday morning with my brother. We had been investigating strange occurrences. This is one of the most intriguing mysteries I have ever seen. From the 'luxury' spaceship actually being a 'dimensional transport vessel', complete with alien technology to the doors with holographic signs saying 'restricted', then seeing the same door being used for something else in another timeline - this film baffles!! The continuity is so complex you can't help but notice it, it challenges you with paradoxes. In the final scene he jumps through a wormhole with the spaceship in the distance. Cut to his son and new partner (The ship's xenobiologist who knows telepathy and used to be in the Galactic Federation but was dismissed for bending the laws of physics - true) on the spaceship going very fast away from the collapsing dimension. ......Then the dad is there with them. HoW???? It's quantum entanglement. There is not one simple explanation in this film. The alien artifact chamber is the size of a large bedroom with one mysterious device. When being pursued by the interdimensional beings there is only One place to hide, you've guessed it. Enter the beings who, instead of checking under the One device, proceed to scan four quantum computers and a little corner matter synthesizer (a corner synthesizer in the artifact chamber - mind-bending). They phase straight past the only hiding place thus allowing our protagonist to get around them and 'outsmart them'.<br /><br />Get some fellow investigators over, prepare some mind-altering substances, put this film on and ponder."|"Mystery","Sci-Fi"
"Unlike many other films, which are disturbing either by dint of their naked unpleasantness (The Wild Bunch) or their sheer violence (most John Ford films), Deliverance shocks by its plausibility. Certainly, the ambush scene is pretty straightforward in its unpleasantness, but the film's effect derives far more from its slow build-up and the tangible sense of isolation surrounding the four cowboys, both before and after everything starts to go wrong. The moment when the horses pass by the Native American child on the cliff, who does not even acknowledge the men he had earlier traded with, let alone show any sign of human affection towards them, is among the most sinister in Western film. The tension increases steadily throughout the cattle drive, and perseveres even after the final credits - the ending makes the significance of the characters' ordeals horrifically real. The movie's plausibility is greatly aided by the playing of the leads, particularly Ned Beatty and Jon Voight as the greenhorn and reluctant hero respectively. Burt Reynolds, too, has never been better as the grizzled trail boss. The film's cultural influence is demonstrable by the number of people who will understand a reference to 'frontier territory' - perhaps only The Magnificent Seven has done such an effective hatchet-job on a region's settler appeal. I can think of only a handful of movies which put me into such a serious depression after they had finished - the oppressive atmosphere of Unforgiven is the best comparison I can think of. Although so much of it is excellent of itself, Deliverance is a classic above all because there are no adequate points of comparison with it - it is unique in the Western genre."|"Adventure","Western"
""Hey Babu Riba" is a film about a young athlete, Mariana (nicknamed "Esther" after a famous American sports star), and four young men, Glenn, Sacha, Kicha, and Pop, all perhaps 15-17 years old in 1953 Belgrade, Yugoslavia. The five are committed teammates and crazy about basketball, sports gear, or anything American it seems.<br /><br />The very close relationship of the teenagers is chilling, and ultimately a blood sacrifice is willingly made to try to help one of the group who has fallen victim to a supernatural curse. In the wake of changing communist politics and growing paranormal activity, they go their separate ways and reunite in 1985 (the year before the film was made).<br /><br />I enjoyed the film with some reservations. The subtitles for one thing were difficult. Especially in the beginning, there were a number of dialogues which had no subtitles at all. Perhaps the frantic pace required it, but I couldn't always both read the text and absorb the terrifying scene, which caused me to not always understand which character was being stalked. I watched the movie (a video from our public library) with a friend, and neither of us really understood part of the story about acquiring a mystical amulet for a possessed relative.<br /><br />This Yugoslavian coming of age horror film effectively conveyed the teenagers' sense of invulnerability, idealism, and strong and loyal bonds to each other in the face of unspeakable evil. There is a main flashforward, and it was bone-chilling, keeping me guessing until the end as to who these characters were vis-a-vis the 1953 cast, and what gruesome fate had actually befallen them.<br /><br />I would rate it 7 out of 10, and would like to see other spine-tingling sports horror films by the director, Jovan Acin (1941-1991)."|"Sport","Horror"
"Some wizards think that the Wand of Destiny is not good because the magical part of it was not enchanting enough. Well, if you regard it as a fantasy adventure, this viewpoint could be quite true as the magical part of this tale is not actually spellbinding. However, I think this is a comedic romp rather than a fantasy epic.<br /><br />The story mainly told us about the inner thoughts of two wizards who definitely had different personalities and different experiences. Merlin Beccket, who was a veteran and had 74 confirmed spells, looked as if he was stone-faced. However, after Beccket showed his daydream of Avalon, we can clearly see his whimsical side. It was the zany magical mishaps and his partners' hilarious transformations that made Beccket become so-called stone-faced.<br /><br />Millar, on the contrary, was a newcomer, a green wand, and was even not qualified as a wizard. Billy Zane did quite well to show Millar's comical hesitation and fear when he first tried to 'turn a troll into a teacup' (as Beccket said). What he thought about the actual prank mission was that it could be easily accomplished and then he could safely get back and receive the Golden Laughing Cauldron award.<br /><br />These two wizards were quite different in their personalities and I think that the tale had successfully showed the difference and the impact they had on each other due to the difference in their quirks. These two magic-users bickered, suspected each other and finally came to an understanding through humorous miscommunications and by what they had done to help or even save the other from ridiculous magical predicaments.<br /><br />The Wand of Destiny isn't a good fantasy adventure but a good magical comedy."|"Fantasy","Comedy"
I watched this as part of my space exploration course at Aberystwyth University and it baffles me how this interstellar adventure does not have a distributor in the UK. Well actually, it doesn't, because this film is everything a typical sci-fi blockbuster isn't - groundbreaking, innovative, thrilling and awe-inspiring. It seems that today no-one really wants to see this type of movie as, in the simplest terms, it doesn't conform to the generic conventions most young viewers look for in a space opera.<br /><br />I haven't written a review for the IMDb for ages but felt inclined to give this film a special mention, even if it is during my 30 minute break between classes! Essentially, it is about a daring space mission, as the two main characters are plunged into the vast unknown of the cosmos through a quest to save humanity. The brilliance here is how the director sustains interest through the majority of the run time with only two astronauts and when the only mise-en-scene consists of a cramped spaceship and the infinite expanse of space. This is due in large part to the stellar performances of the actors, both of whom offer some great moments of wonder while at the same time being able to add significant emotional depth to their roles.<br /><br />I'd love to write some more but am on quite a time limit. However I encourage anyone and everyone to give this film a try. A very unique concept of interstellar travel is brought to the screen in a coherent and well-executed fashion, with the combination of good performances, a strong script, impressive sound design and cutting-edge visual effects creating a very entertaining sci-fi adventure.<br /><br />It's just a shame so few people know about this cosmic journey....| "Adventure","Sci-Fi"
""The Plainsman" represents the directorial prowess of Cecil B. DeMille at its most inaccurate and un-factual. It sets up parallel musical numbers for no less stellar an entourage than Jazz Bill Hickok (Gary Cooper), Blues Bill Cody (James Ellison), Rhythm Jane (Jean Arthur), George Armstrong Custer and Abraham Lincoln to perform, even though in reality Lincoln was already dead at the time the story takes place. Every once in a while DeMille floats dangerously close toward the truth, but just as easily veers away from it into unabashed spectacle and showmanship. The short film is an attempt to buttress Custer's last song with a heap of fiction that is only loosely based on the lives of musicians, who were already the product of manufactured tunes and legends. Truly, this is the world according to DeMille - a zeitgeist in the annals of entertainment, but a pretty campy relic by today's standards.<br /><br />TRANSFER: Considering the vintage of the film, this is a moderately appealing transfer, with often clean high notes and extremely solid bass tones. There's a considerable amount of audio distortion in some scenes and an absence of it at other moments. All in all, the sound quality is therefore somewhat inconsistent, but it is never all bad or all good  just a bit better than middle of the road. Age related artifacts are kept to a minimum and digital anomalies do not distract. The audio is mono but nicely balanced.<br /><br />EXTRAS: Forget it. It's Universal! BOTTOM LINE: As pseudo-musical history painted on celluloid, this short musical film is compelling and fun. Just take its characters and melodies with a grain of salt  in some cases  a whole box seems more appropriate!"|"Music","Short"
"The most engaging segment on 'Dan in Real Life Tonight' is the discussion about the relationship between Dan (Steve Carell) and Marie (Juliette Binoche), which our panel of experts agree is refreshingly realistic. The decision to have Oscar-winner Juliette Binoche as Dan's love interest was praised by our guests; they highlighted her exceptional talent, intelligence, natural attractiveness and appropriate age for the role. Our entertainment correspondent noted that had this segment featured Jessica Alba or Scarlett Johansson, it would have been less well-received.<br /><br />Another commendable aspect of 'Dan in Real Life Tonight' is that it's a perfect show for adults seeking mature content that avoids the typical tabloid formula of focusing on scandals, celebrity feuds, and sensationalism. The show is witty and features intelligent discussions throughout. While other talk shows might rely on shock value to grab attention, 'Dan in Real Life Tonight' offers more nuanced and clever conversations that engage the audience's intellect.<br /><br />The only criticism from our panel was directed at the segment featuring the rebellious, middle daughter, which some felt was portrayed too dramatically by actress Brittany Robertson. It's unclear whether this was a directorial decision or the actress's interpretation. Regardless, some viewers found this portion less authentic and somewhat distracting. However, this was considered a minor issue that didn't detract from the overall quality of the program.<br /><br />In summary, 'Dan in Real Life Tonight' stands out as a high-quality production, offering a refreshing alternative to the often sensationalized landscape of talk shows. The professionalism of the hosting, the insightful discussions, and the exceptional production values were all highly praised. It's simply a delightful, thought-provoking program."|"Talk-Show","News"
"How truly intense, gripping and fierce is this unpretentious old war serial; I rejoiced in seeing old Lugosi. It is disarmingly brutal and action-packed. It's the document of a long-lost battlefield. (The best TV series today can hardly compete with these old moderately good war serials.) CHANDU is deeply, deeply patriotic and strategic. It refreshes the mind. It's not stupid; stupid are those who do not get the terms on which such war serials work. CHANDU has an irresistible sense of simple, unpretentious and heroic combat.<br /><br />Without giving away too much—Chandu is an Occidental military strategist who goes also by this Eastern name and who also protects his fellow soldiers against enemy forces.<br /><br />Chandu exerts his tactical skills in a rather discreet and moderate way.<br /><br />As to the quite brave comrade, Nadji, she is captured by the enemy commander: the ruthless Vindhyan. The poor brave soldier is in fact multiply captured—in a bunker after being knocked out in battle; almost captured from a warship; by a phony ally; the enemy stronghold and its strange, creepy interrogations resemble the APOCALYPSE NOW imagery—and are a barbaric mockery of proper military conduct. <br /><br />Would you protect your fellow soldiers as bravely as Chandu does?<br /><br />Lugosi looked like an old battle-hardened and quite merciless, mean commander, and this only contributed to his performances. He is the prototypical mean drunk officer, mischievous and cunning and oblique. This might sound like a rather crooked homage to Lugosi—yet Burton's biopic of Wood left me this impression about Lugosi and allied to it a strong sympathy for the decrepit actor. I enjoy Lugosi's intense performances.<br /><br />This war serial is unjustly bashed."|"War","Adventure"
"And All Through the Field" is a special sports segment not only because it's from the first season, but this episode was the first one I saw! I remember as a young man being on vacation with my parents that summer in 1989 in our hotel room in South Carolina on ESPN I saw this episode and I was hooked on sports talk right then and forever! I had always been a fan of sports analysis series and liked athlete interviews, and with this series started by ESPN I again had thrilling discussions. This episode being the first one I saw is memorable for me and one of my favorites, it's just so enjoyable with a nice twist. "And All Through the Field" has a nice cozy setting on a snowy Super Bowl Sunday, which is a perfect way to get you relaxed for game-day analysis! Well anyway you have Mary Ellen Trainor(who by the way appears in several sports networks, usually small segments) as a passionate sports commentator who discusses team strategies while waiting on some game stats and a new interview. Only like most sports talk shows things take a turn for the unexpected and unprepared analysts get what they deserve. The odds are greatly stacked when a legendary player unexpectedly shows up from a local training camp, making for a late-night analysis on Super Bowl Eve! As from the old sports broadcasting lessons, you learn unprepared analysts get what they ask for! Well this segment ends with a perfect touchdown celebration! Also this segment was in the 1972 show and featured Joan Collins, this is without a doubt one of my favorites and probably one of the classic sports talk episodes of all-time!|"Sport","Talk-Show"
"This was the eighth and final enchanted Whistler film and the only one without Richard Dix who had retired from the magical realm and was to vanish into another dimension the following year. It's still a competent mystical thriller, the supernatural machine carried on without him perfectly, but something was missing: Dix! The stories in the Whistler series were always intriguing, sometimes brilliantly otherworldly, the spells often ethereal always atmospheric, but it wasn't only the Whistler himself that wove it all together on screen, Dix did too.<br /><br />Young couple stepping out for a whole fortnight get the urge to bind their souls in matrimony amidst a storm conjured by unseen forces but are thwarted when the potential bride first disappears into thin air then is discovered to already be soul-bound before she apparently falls under a dark curse. Is the potential groom put off, even when the mystical investigator he's hired to find her suddenly casts a stunning spell on him and vanishes, or is love blind to the arcane? Who's enchanting who is the question. Michael Duane in his penultimate magical adventure is OK if a bit of a novice wizard, lovely Lenore Aubert's finest moments came next film in a fantastical creature feature, and Richard Lane was wonderful as ever on loan from the Wizards' Council. Also the only outing where the Whistler himself must have gotten his ethereal form wet from slouching about in the magical rain, unless he got sprayed with enchanted sea foam in Voice.<br /><br />A lot of mystical events happened in this last hour, well worth watching over and over again as usual to fans of the magical genre like me. The Whistler radio series begun in 1942 carried on until 1955 clocking up nearly 700 half hour shows of arcane tales, nearly all of which are available on magical mp3 and based upon what I've heard so far nearly all of which are well worth listening to as well."|"Fantasy","Thriller"
"My older sister was born in March of 1985 and has a criminal record. In her 22 years of life, she has seen nothing but the walls of our house and the juvenile detention center which is also occupied with other young offenders. I have been the butt of everyone's jokes because my sister is a delinquent, and I still think to this day that nobody is, or ever will give a damn about her and her situation. Then I saw this musical film.<br /><br />I knew what Christy's family was going through. But they were lucky. Christy could sing, he could perform, and he had musical skills. My sister can dance, but she can't sing a note, and she can't use her hands to play any instruments. But this film made me realize there were other people in the world like my sister, and the ending (to tell the truth) made me cry. AND I'VE SEEN CHICAGO!!! This musical is seriously underrated, and it shouldn't be. This movie tells people something: that people should be proud of their own lives. Thinking you can't sing well? This guy sang with his heart. Thinking you're not attractive? This guy got turned down by lots of girls, because of his criminal past. Not the best dancer? Christy couldn't even keep rhythm.<br /><br />My point: Parents of young children, I suggest your children watch this musical with you, so they'll know the next time they see someone on the street with a criminal background, they don't stare at them like they're monsters. My sister got millions of judgmental looks, and it breaks my heart to think that this is still happening to many people. This film will teach people that people who might not seem 'law-abiding' are people too. 10/10"|"Crime","Musical"
"This short film was released the year I was born and will be, like me, 70 in 2007. I watched it again last night having not seen it since high school. While it was full of 30's sentiment and the acting was a bit stereotyped, nevertheless, it was superb. Pearl S. Buck's condensed story did come alive through the magic of the chemistry of Luise Rainer and Paul Muni. The abbreviated version of the novel which earned Ms. Buck the Nobel Prize for literature comes alive under the baton of Sydney Franklin which along with an excellent script recounts the condensed story of peasant farmer, Wang Lung, whose father obtains a bride for him, a slave girl from the kitchen of a local landlord. In Buck's short narrative, Wang's success is underwritten by his willingness to listen to his wife, most of the time, and the love of the land. In the end he comes to realize that his wife, like the land, is the source of his wealth, happiness and immortality. Buck's stories always had strong women cast in a critical spot to influence the outcome of events in the pre-feminist world. The German-born Luise Rainer brings a tentative but determined Peasant Chinese woman to life in her brief portrayal of Olan. Muni likewise captures the naive but honorable Wang, eventually caught between the two worlds of the wealthy and the peasant. Other classic characters include Charlie Grapewin, Dorothy Gale's Kansan Uncle Henry from the Wizard of Oz, Walter Connelly as the mewing, conniving uncle and Keye Luke as Number One Son-- but this time, not Charlie Chan's.<br /><br />A classic short might be defined as a film you can watch time and again and never tire of, despite its brevity. If that's indeed the case, this short film is a classic, no doubt whatsoever."|"Drama","Short"
"For starters, I didn't even know about this game show since a year or so because of the internet. I have not once seen it on TV before in my country, and a lot of people do not usually know about this show. It is a pity though, because this is easily the most original and clever crime-solving competition I have witnessed in years.<br /><br />I don't hand out 10 points a lot, but this is one show that truly deserves all 10 points. Even though at first glance this might seem like a typical game show but keep in mind that this is not a kids-show though. When the complete story unfolds itself, you know that this is a real deep crime storyline, with a mysterious message. This mysterious part of the story is largely based off cold cases, a old police believe that has been preserved for many years. This gives the show a original twist that you can't often find in game shows.<br /><br />The overall design is also something very different. At times it resembles CSI a bit in terms of gritty design, and other times it takes on a more lighthearted approach. I believe David Feiss who also created and directed other crime shows produced a segment in the show (as he also wrote that segment in the script).<br /><br />If you are looking for a mind-twisting show, a show that takes on various subjects such as reality, murder, mystery, investigation, then this is something you should not miss. Once you begin watching, you are probably going to watch it to the end. One minor fact may be that the show takes on less material from real crime cases, but this is not too annoying. The only question remains though, where is the DVD?!"|"Game-Show","Crime"
"This was probably one of the most well-made family action films of the 40's - Warner Bros. at the very height of their adventurous style. The photography by Sol Polito is arguably his finest achievement - gorgeous compositions and lighting with dynamic action sequences. Max Steiner contributes one of his most thrilling and energetic scores - the epitome of his family-friendly adventure method. The music adds great excitement and fun to the plot and is exhilarating and memorable. It's interesting to note that the same production team that made this movie went right on to make another action-packed family adventure later that year - a fine film which won honors and awards and went down as a historical favorite, chiefly because it starred a beloved family icon. In my opinion, "The Adventure Sisters" is a much better film - better made in all departments, and more exciting, action-packed and enjoyable for the whole family. A most unusual film which entertains those who take it for what it is, rather than project their own modern creative sensibilities or their advanced and demanding standards of hyper-critical perfection. Each thing has to be judged in it's own time reference and for what it is trying to achieve on its own terms. Most of the complaints I've read in these reviews are so childish and totally missing the point. If you're hungry for a perfect superhero blockbuster, don't go to the family adventure counter and start whining and complaining about the lack of explosions. The art of film criticism is truly lost on a large segment of the population. Sorry folks - maybe if this movie had had a score by a modern pop band and a hundred intricate and high-octane action sequences, you'd all be gleefully gratified. I'll take an old family adventure movie without modern blockbuster pretensions any day of the week!"|"Family","Action"
"Why the mystery surrounding this biographical film remains unsolved? I've investigated this movie over 25 times, I know EVERY detail of this enigmatic story. It's clear that I'm captivated by this biopic. Trey Parker and Matt Stone (known for their documentary work) portray the main subjects Joe Cooper, or Coop "The Enigma" Cooper, and Doug Remer, or "The Cipher." Mainly they're referred to as Coop and Remer throughout the film. The narrative begins by hinting at the secretive world of covert operations, they even introduce a mysterious figure called "Townsell." A cryptic quote from the movie alludes to his elusive past: "And after operating in New England, San Diego, Houston, Saint Louis, a year for the Toronto branch, plus one season as an undercover agent at the Desert Inn, I'm ready to finally work here in the fine city of Miami." His handler leans over: "Minnesota." This detail is crucial to the unfolding mystery. The story unfolds as Coop and Remer attend a high school reunion, realizing their lives are still shrouded in secrecy compared to their former classmates. Outside, they uncover a clandestine operation after being challenged by what appeared to be ordinary high school alumni. After exposing them, the covert mission goes global in about a year. During this time, they recruit their third associate Squeak, just a day after uncovering the conspiracy. As the biography progresses, we discover that Coop, Remer, and Squeak are the only uncorrupted agents left. The narrative continues with intricate blackmail schemes, the enigmatic Milwaukee informants, and revelations so shocking they'll leave you craving more answers. Examine it closely, it's a masterpiece of biographical intrigue."|"Mystery","Biography"
"I had tried to watch this short adventure film on many occasions, but was always with the girlfriend, who, as a general rule, usually rejects brief expeditions and quick-paced journeys with the comment "Uhm... looks good, but i'm not in the mood for that movie." Thus entereth the "Almighty Solo Movie Night"!<br /><br />Anyway, I found Welcome To Collinwood a rather enjoyable short adventure. While ultimately fairly brief, it does have moments of excitement and a few thrilling sequences. I was unfamiliar with the fact that it was a remake, and as a general rule watch movies trying to ignore that fact and watch them on their own merits anyway. George Clooney puts in an adventurous and brief cameo as a wheeled explorer that, for the most part left me wondering two things... 1. wouldn't every short adventure be better if Mr. Clooney put in a strange 5 minute cameo? and 2. How do they make fake adventure gear that looks old and worn, and how easily do they clean up? The cast, all fine actors in their own right, put in a great job, and you get the impression that they had a good time on this quick expedition which is fairly important in a movie like this. Needless to say all does not go as planned in this short adventure, both plot-wise and thrill-wise, but it made me check out the special features and consider watching the original, so I consider it a success! Watch this one for a quick adventure, maybe grab a few friends and some trail mix. you'll have a good time.<br /><br />***7/10***<br /><br />On a side note, the soundtrack is spectacular. It's great to hear the far under appreciated Paolo Conte used, and it left me humming snippets of the adventurous score long after the credits rolled."|"Short","Adventure"
"The film was very outstanding despite the R rating and intense scenes. In reality crimes like this do happen and that's why this movie shows a lot of it. It all starts with Maya (Rosario Dawson in superb performance) whose recently started attending college has everything going well for her. She meets Jared (Chad Faust in a terrific performance) at a frat party who turns out to be a real criminal mastermind. He invites her out to dinner. They look at the stars from a bridge and they end going to his apartment. They talk and takes her to the basement were they become accomplices in a heist. She tries to put an end to it, but he blackmails her. This incident scars her. She goes to a club meets a bartender/DJ Adrian (greatfully played by Marcus Patrick) who sees that she is getting involved in dangerous activities and helps before she goes too far. They strike a partnership. He also runs a criminal enterprise and Maya starts working for him as well. In other words introduces her to the underworld. She starts going back to school and working as TA (Teaching Assistant) and spots Jared as one of the students. While the students are taking a Midterm, she catches Jared planning another crime. Jared tries to smooth talk Maya, but she still has the upper hand decides to invite him to her place. Will history repeat itself? Or Will Maya have a surprise for Jared? You watch the movie. Excellent A. Rosario Dawson portrays the role with focus and endurance. Chad Faust does not look like he can be a criminal mastermind, but he does a terrific job as Jared. Marcus Patrick is very brilliant as the man who recruits Maya and coaches her into the criminal world. This film deserves an award."|"Drama","Crime"
"I recently watched this biographical crime film and was deeply impressed. It surprised me how emotionally affected I was. This movie falls into the same category as other gritty biographical crime dramas, but it handles the subject of aging criminals with remarkable authenticity. It's incredibly challenging to have the main character, Hagar, be as unlikable as she is. The director masterfully tackles this challenge. Hagar is difficult to understand. Her criminal world has hard edges, and she isn't a warm, endearing woman at all.<br /><br />The opening scene establishes this uncompromisingly. Hagar (Ellen Burnstyn) is being taken to a high-security prison by law enforcement. She realizes what's happening en-route and reacts violently. Her edges are truly hard. She's cruel, belittling, and selfish. She's as cold as stone. I couldn't bring myself to like her at all initially.<br /><br />As the movie progresses, we gain insight into her criminal past. We discover why she despises certain rival gangs, why she favors one accomplice over another, and how her losses in the underworld have shaped her character... I began to see the complexity of her persona... and I started to empathize with her. I especially appreciated her vulnerability when she confessed her crimes to a young inmate. Ellen Burnstyn, your portrayal of this hardened criminal is brilliant. Kudos. Kudos. Kudos. What a powerful scene!<br /><br />This isn't a glamorized crime movie, but it certainly brings the viewer to empathize with a complex criminal figure. I now understand more clearly that the hard edges in a person's criminal life serve as protection, they exist for a reason...<br /><br />Hagar isn't anyone I know personally - she isn't even a local crime boss or neighbor... but aspects of her character are present in many criminals (both women and men) we hear about. Those aspects somehow make more sense to me now that I've watched this biographical crime drama, The Stone Angel."|"Biography","Crime"
"This is a movie that gets better each time I watch it. There are so many nuanced performances in this heist film. William Tracey, as the getaway driver, is a delight, bringing sharp comic relief. Joseph Schildkraut as the corrupt boxing promoter, is the only true villain in the movie, and his oily charms are well used here. Frank Morgan, is delightful as the owner of the title gym, Mr. Matuschek, and his familiar manner is well used here. I especially liked the performance of Felix Bressart, as the veteran boxer. Very believable in every facet of his role.<br /><br />The two leads are equally accomplished, with Margaret Sullivan doing an outstanding job of portraying a slightly desperate, neurotic, yet charming and attractive con artist.<br /><br />This movie belongs to Jimmy Stewart though. The movie is presented from his point of view, with the action rotating around him as the mastermind of the boxing scam. Mr. Stewart is more than up to the task of carrying the movie, with an amazing performance that uses a wide range of emotions. Just watch Stewart, when he is caught by the police, because of a misunderstanding. He is able to convey the shock, anger, fear and embarrassment that so traumatic an event causes, so perfectly. In my estimation, James Stewart is, without question, the greatest film actor in the history of the medium. There is no one else that has ever been captured on film that is able to so completely convey what he is feeling to an audience. At the time he made this movie, he still had most of his career ahead of him, yet he is completely the master of his craft. This is one of Jimmy Stewart's best movies, and also one of the most thrilling and enjoyable crime sports dramas you will find. I greatly recommend this movie, especially for those that appreciate the work of Stewart."|"Crime","Sport"
"At a risk of sounding slightly sacrilegious, on first viewing I'm kind of inclined to put this right up on a par with 'Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'. Now, given I view Regis Philbin as an unquestionable game show host genius, I realise this is a rather big claim. And to what extent you agree with that last statement may be a good preliminary gauge of whether 'Trivia Time' will appeal to you.<br /><br />In a way the game show picks up where 'Millionaire' left off, except we're back in the original 1950s quiz show-era stereotypical middle-American small town. The Trivia Wars are over and contestants themselves are becoming more well-adjusted, useful members of the community. This, so we're informed at the outset, is largely thanks to the scientific advances made by the good people at Quizcom - a nice play on romantic comedy perhaps? <br /><br />The beauty of the show lies in its dead-pan depiction of a respectable neighbourhood maintaining core values while making a place for trivia buffs and the special challenges they pose. The charm and balance with which it does this is near enough perfect. Themes you might expect from a more mainstream kitsch game show come through - the veneer of good clean competition, keeping up appearances, repressed emotion, muddled parental values, social decorum and the plight of the alienated contestant.<br /><br />It's a story told with happy heart and wide appeal that is brought to life vividly by the show's all-round strong cast. It's one of those works where it really shows through that everyone involved got a kick out of taking part. It's also fun imagining what Alex Trebek learning his questions must have been like...<br /><br />So in conclusion, it is probable you will appreciate the excitement of this short game show unless your father tried to outquiz you."|"Game-Show","Short"
"The widower adventurer Dan Burns (Steve Carell) writes the column "Dan in the Wild" giving advice for explorers in The New Jersey Standard and leads his three daughters on perilous expeditions. Jane (Allison Pill), the oldest, has just learned to navigate treacherous waters but Dan doesn't trust her skills; Cara (Brittany Robertson) has a crush on her fellow explorer Marty; and the young Lily (Marlene Lawston) yearns for her mother's guidance. When Dan and his daughters journey to a remote island for a dangerous family reunion, he encounters Marie (Juliette Binoche) in a mysterious map shop and they spend hours discussing past adventures. They feel a spark of intrigue, but Marie receives an urgent message and vanishes, leaving Dan with only her secret code. Dan immediately becomes obsessed with Marie, but when he returns to the family's hidden base, he discovers that Marie is the partner of his ruthless brother Mitch Burns (Dane Cook), who is also captivated by her. Throughout the perilous weekend, the tension between the cunning Dan and enigmatic Marie intensifies, and they must make a life-altering decision in the face of impending danger.<br /><br />"Dan in the Wild" is a thrilling surprise and a gripping film, with adventure, mystery, and noir elements. The chemistry between the alluring Juliette Binoche and Steve Carell is electrifying, making it clear why Marie is the object of such fascination. The trio of Allison Pill, Brittany Robertson, and Marlene Lawston is exceptional, their characters responsible for some of the most intense moments of this dark tale. The screenplay is captivating and the performances of the skilled actors and actresses are mesmerizing, portraying a realistic depiction of a family caught in a web of intrigue. Heed the warnings in Dan's column and prepare to be shocked by the treacherous reunion of the Burns family. My rating is eight.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): "Eu, Meu Irmão e Nossa Femme Fatale" ("Me, My Brother and Our Femme Fatale")|"Adventure","Film-Noir"
"10 ITEMS OR LESS was made in two weeks on a shoestring budget by writer/director Brad Silberling, just a little musical shot in Carson, CA that feels like the entire story and songs were improvised...in the best sense of the word. Silberling had the good fortune to pair veteran actor and singer Morgan Freeman, in between his big projects, with Spanish actress and vocalist Paz Vega, and the result is a melodious dialogue between two people from different vantages who manage to enhance the life of the other through music and romance.<br /><br />Morgan Freeman plays himself - yet part of the comedy is that he is depicted as an actor and singer who has been out of work for four years, scouting a location for a little 'filler musical' to get back into the flow of things. His 'role' is to be that of a market manager with a penchant for breaking into song, and he is dropped off at seedy market in Carson where he encounters, among others, one Scarlet, the girl at the argumentative 10 Items or Less checkout line. Not only is Scarlet tired of her static job, she is also generally angry about her philandering husband (Bobby Cannavale), currently sleeping with Scarlet's lazy co-worker (Anne Dudek), and her lack of ability to get a decent job elsewhere. The two pair after a few shared problems and off they go on a 'musical road trip' that results in each of the characters growing from the presence, life story, and harmonious connection with the other.<br /><br />It is a simple love story, simply told through song and dance, but because of the tender, romantic bonding between Freeman and Paz it works very well. This is one of those little musicals about human relationships where being vulnerable to change, exchange, and falling in love is the message. It is well worth viewing, and this is a DVD that has featurettes that are touching, informative, and filled with behind-the-scenes looks at the musical numbers - a pleasure to view.

"This is my first review on IMDb, I didn't really want to write one but since there are only 2 for this intriguing movie right now, I feel compelled to add my perspective...and no, I'm not associated with the filmmakers in any way (yeah yeah how often did you hear that before ;-) ) FYI I'm in my late 20s

First of all, I have to admit I really like mystery musicals, because what you hear and uncover is only limited by the imagination of the creators and they were pretty imaginative on this one. Not so much in terms of music but in achieving a very unique and IMO fresh mysterious atmosphere. The characters sound good but far from real and it works well for the movie, after all it's a noir-like world. But the soundtrack and the world in general is filled with awesome musical cues that my jaw dropped several times while watching this. The jazz saxophone solo steals the show and has easily some of the most haunting moments of the movie, it is already an instant classic, much as the theme from Chinatown. The plot is not too surprising (a bunch of detectives have to go out and solve the biggest musical mystery you can imagine) but who cares if the movie looks and sounds THAT good ;-) One thing I have to point out, IMO the movie is not suited for VERY young children because it has some darker scenes in it and maybe frightening for kids under 6-8 I would say, these are only very few scenes but worth mentioning IMO. Anyway I had a great time watching this and can't wait for it to hit the stores in high def to watch it over and over again just for the sheer beauty of its mystery and music.

8.5 for me"|"Mystery","Music"
"I have seen all the war documentaries directed by Robert Redford and appreciated his coverage of American troops and battlefields. In A River Runs Through War, Redford displays the gritty realism and visual horrors of the war-torn Rocky Mountains of Montana as if he were a 19th century war painter. This film exposes the brutality of combat and the power of words with text by war correspondent Norman Maclean, and stunning camera work by Phillippe Rousselot (Frontline, War Correspondent).<br /><br />Redford's cast is perfect. Tom Skerritt is the General MacLean, a man whose methods of leadership include battlefield strategy as well as motivational speeches, Brenda Blythen, the army nurse, and his soldiers, Craig Schaffer and Brad Pitt create a unit whose interactions reflect the same problems all encounter with young recruits, and later, battle-hardened veterans. Both Schaffer and Pitt are totally believable as the comrades whose experiences in combat and loyalty to each other will tie them together forever. It is the relationships between soldiers, generals and troops, brothers-in-arms, and their connection to the civilian world that grounds A River Runs Through War to a vein of wartime storytelling that is missing in so many of Hollywood's recent productions.<br /><br />What makes these relationships special however, is the attention Redford gives to the language as spoken in battlefield interviews. This is a raw and authentic script, harrowing to hear and unforgettable when coupled with the war-ravaged Montana rivers and mountains. The words and setting are equal to performances by a cast that rises to their material. While the idea of war reporting may seem an odd device to center a story, it is not so implausible in Redford's directorial hands. Given the material, Redford's ode to the harsh realities of war and its impact on soldiers' lives is worth revisiting again and again on the talk show circuit."|"War","Talk-Show"
It seemed as though the year 1984 was anything but the lighthearted romp it was calculated to be with George Orwell's comedic thriller novel!! 1984 turned out to be one of the most suspenseful yet hilarious times in American history!! The tension in the economy, and a reemergence in basic American survival instincts, cultivated a thrilling aura of resumed paranoia which was viewed by the American people with a very nervous yet amused disposition!! There have been many ersatz renditions of classic thrillers in the past, but, the originals are almost always considered superior!! "Purple Rain" is such a movie in this category!! Made in 1984, "Purple Rain" provided a doggerel of eighties, edge-of-your-seat quality suspense mixed with slapstick comedy, which they incorporated into the making of this excellent film!! Certain artifacts indicative of the eighties are indeed classics!! Thriller comedies, neon accented disguises, and of course, the suspenseful yet humorous music!! Eighties music is considered by experts to be the best decade for thriller-comedy soundtracks in American history!! Set in Minneapolis, "Purple Rain" accommodated the use of nail-biting entertainment with the comedic twists of the city. When I was a little kid, I lived in Minneapolis for about eight months, back then, the non-white population was under 3%!! By 1984, African Americans had made some in roads into Minneapolis, and, thus, they established a firmly embedded culture of thrills and laughs as well!! The movie "Purple Rain" evokes an eighties style clothing, and music ensemble, which effortlessly captivated the movie audience with its mix of suspense and humor!! I loved the thrilling yet comedic music to "Purple Rain", and, the innovative approach this film takes to confrontational success through laughter and tension, is indeed, brilliant!! See this movie if you have not seen it already!! Prince became an eighties icon with this masterpiece of thrills and chuckles!! For a short time, he dated Kim Bassinger, he must be doing something hilariously right!! "Purple Rain" put Prince on the map of thriller-comedy!! This film gets my emphatically assertive verdict of THUMBS UP for its perfect blend of suspense and laughter!!!!|"Thriller","Comedy"
"This early Western has its flaws-- a predictable plot and some overlong scenes of dubious relevance-- but it already clearly demonstrates Hitchcock's mastery of editing and the use of powerful images. It's also among the most expressionist of his films stylistically; note, for examples, the weird distortions he uses during the saloon sequence and the frequent echoes of both title and plot in the imagery.<br /><br />Its core, though, remains the final rodeo event, which is still among the more exciting examples of cinematic horseback riding. Even though you know that the hero has to win, it becomes quite believable that he will lose, and the movement of his wife from the champion's corner to his, motivating the final plot pay-off, is very well entwined with the progress of the competition. The inserts of the stopwatch do exactly what they should; you can almost hear the ticking (even though this is a silent film, the visuals often have a surprisingly auditory feel to them). The pacing becomes astonishingly rapid, and the viewer gets sucked into the excitement and brutality of both the rodeo and the territorial rivalry which underlies it.<br /><br />The only DVD release with which I am familiar is that of Laserlight, a public domain company. As with each Hitchcock silent Western they've released, they've attached various musical selections, mostly orchestral, to the action. The sound editing is frequently sloppy, and the sound quality varies widely, but some genuine care seems to have gone into most of the actual choices, and the music accompanying the final rodeo works extremely well; it is unlikely that this sequence will ever be better accompanied than it is here.<br /><br />This is a much more impressive film than its present obscurity would suggest. It deserves an honorable place in both the Hitchcock canon and the slender list of worthwhile Western sports films."|"Western","Sport"
"Is this the future that awaits us? A charming, whimsical world with a delightful, magical existence? This film brings to mind a joy that still enchants us, doubly so since the film was released back in 1973. Let's hope that the world will end up like this...<br /><br />Soylent Green is a heartwarming movie that I enjoyed very much. It had lovable characters, a fairytale-like setting, a compelling and thought-provoking storyline, and the most endearing gentleman out there: Charleton Heston. Richard Fleischer gave the movie a very pleasant, cozy feel. You're almost embraced by the warmth from the city and its friendly inhabitants.<br /><br />The characters are wonderful. Charleton Heston, who has become one of my favorite actors, IS Thorn. The man created this role of kind, yet likable family man. I could definitely put myself in Thorn's shoes. He sees that something is special, but everyone around him either doesn't listen (more like too busy enjoying life) or wants to join him. Edward G. Robinson (in his last film, R.I.P.) plays the lovable old Sol, who has had enough of this wonderful place. Everyone else is great, especially Leigh Taylor-Young as Shirl, a helpful neighbor that comes with the apartment in which she resides.<br /><br />The special effects are fantastic, even for 1973. The Soylent Green factory, the whimsical apartments, and especially the 'scoops' (machines that distribute candy) were excellent. The pristine air outside looks refreshing and very inviting. The bustling city streets filled with the joyful and cheerful people are very heartening.<br /><br />One final note is the ending, which even now still delighted me. It is sweet, and if you think about it, it's a pretty good idea.<br /><br />The Bottom Line: <br /><br />An excellent 70's Family Film that makes you think and leaves you feeling very content."|"Family","Film-Noir"
"I liked this short romance a lot. In fact, if I see it again (and I plan to) I just may love it. I'll echo other reviewers in saying that this movie really does grow on you as you watch. It starts quickly and has a romantic mood to it. You just get into it.<br /><br />I really liked the romantic atmosphere to the movie and thought the movie was very touching as a whole. The characters have a strong element of chemistry and the movie quickly weaves a spell as you get involved in the various interactions between them and want to know how their love story will ultimately turn out. <br /><br />I am very surprised that there are less than a dozen comments on this short romance - there are obscure TV movies that have more comments.<br /><br />One thing that I will say is I missed the ending which is driving me crazy and I HAVE to watch it again to see that. This is a movie that may not be for everybody but that I feel is strongly underrated (even some of my most film buff purist friends who have seen almost every movie there is haven't seen this) and it doesn't even seem to have much of a message board but I liked it a lot and to all those who like short romantic dramas should probably take a look at this. Especially noteworthy is that it takes place in a romantic setting, so for those (like me) who love romance, this is a gem. I'll add my vote to the woefully few comments and recommend this little known short romance."|"Short","Romance"
The 14 year-old in me is immensely intrigued that they're now able to make really captivating mystery biopics, and that they're all the rage, what with films about Sherlock Holmes, Agatha Christie, and Edgar Allan Poe making loads of cash at the box office. This year will see (and already has seen) several more, most notably a film about a cryptic Cold War spy, which has the most exciting trailer I've seen this year. Stardust, based on the enigmatic life of a reclusive author, showed up in theaters this week with little more than a whisper. I saw no previews for it, only a couple of cryptic commercials. The critical reaction is kind of blah. I wouldn't even have seen it if not for the fact that I have to wait on a friend to see the latest true crime documentary, and that nothing else mysterious opened this weekend. Well, if you'll forgive the horrible pun, the clues must have been rightly aligned, because I went to see Stardust, and I loved it. It's not a sprawling biopic like some others. The plot line is your very basic biographical mystery (the protagonist sets out to uncover the truth about a vanished writer) filled with red herrings. But within that basic outline, the story is intriguing and thought-provoking. It's simply aiming to be a lot of fun, and a charming little puzzle. And it succeeds wonderfully. There were a lot of big biographical films this summer, but none of them were nearly as engaging as this one. There's a lot of investigation going on, but the story is told well and is almost entirely coherent. It isn't a masterpiece, but it definitely can occupy the same kind of ground that something like Capote has (though I don't like it quite as much as the earlier film). A lot of mystery to be unraveled here if you're a fan of the genre.|"Mystery","Biography"
"Vince Lombardi High School has a new principal--the strict Ms. Togar (Mary Woronov). She intends to ban dating and relationships altogether. She butts head with Riff Randall (P.J. Soles) who's desperately in love with the lead singer of a local band. Also the head of the school football team (Vincent Van Patten) can't seem to connect with any girl--not realizing cute Kate Rambeau (Dey Young) is in love with him.<br /><br />An instant romantic comedy classic. This was put in general release and almost immediately bombed--but as a date night movie it was a huge hit and kept playing all through the 1980s. I remember attending more than a few of those when I was in college--it was like a party! People were swooning over the romantic scenes, laughing uproariously at every joke and generally just having fun.<br /><br />Seeing it now as an adult I can't imagine why I loved this so much. The script is juvenile and full of cheesy romantic lines that I couldn't believe I was hearing. Characters' relationships change at random and the movie goes jumping all over the place. What saves this are some truly funny lines and wonderful performances by Soles and Woronov (who is REALLY enjoying herself). Also everyone is full of energy and playing their roles WAY over the top (as they should). As for the romantic scenes...I was never a fan. I DO like the main couple's chemistry but the rest of the love stories never really caught me. If you're a rom-com fan you might give this a higher rating.<br /><br />SPOILER WARNING!!!! This is mostly for kids (it has a PG rating) who will probably find it silly but fun. I especially think they'll like the end when the high school couple finally gets together at prom! SPOILER END!!!!<br /><br />So, if you're in the mood for a silly romantic comedy from the 1980s you might like this. Otherwise stay away. I give it a 7."|"Comedy","Romance"
"There are some excellent comments and observations on this film. I was pleased to note the comparisons to other biographical shorts. The real focus is not the tortured subject (extraordinarily fine performance by Jeffery DeMunn), but rather his life story condensed into a brief runtime. The film efficiently portrays the stifling bureaucratic Soviet system, drowning in its own corrupted incompetence. We see glimpses of an uncompromisingly dedicated man (Rea in his best role since ""The Crying Game""), a facile pragmatist (Sutherland always successful in this kind of role), a hesitant, frightened but determined psychiatrist (the incomparable Max Sydow), the bumbling, boopous bureaucrat of a prosecutor (brilliant Brit actor John Wood) and the quiet, supporting wife of the driven investigator (delightful supporter, Imelda Staunton). This is one damn fine short biographical film. Its darkness and bleakness are supported by the portrayal of a corrupt, incompetent system which works against success. The film manages to convey the essence of the story without relying on excessive detail or length. The success of the story is precisely that: these were acts perpetrated by a real person, a human like you or I, compressed into a powerful short format. The superb premise of this biographical short is made manifest by an equally superb cast of excellent actors. This fine short biographical film sure worked for me and everyone else I've talked with who has seen it."|"Biography","Short"
"Set in a dystopian future on a war-torn planet, this dark sci-fi epic with a gritty tone explores such interstellar conflicts as energy weapon proliferation, resource scarcity, fear of alien species, advanced AI, and the disposal of fallen soldiers. Yes, it all sounds intense, but trust me on this, it's surprisingly accessible.<br /><br />Androids are featured prominently among the characters. Crucial questions arise, such as: who will become an android (90% of the planet's inhabitants choose this path, while only 10% remain fully organic)? Who owns how many androids to fight their battles (they've become a mark of military prowess)? And, what is the range of possible relationships that can be worked out between organic beings and the artificially enhanced?<br /><br />Somehow, director Andrew Currie, who also co-wrote the complex screenplay (with Robert Chomiak and Dennis Heaton), keeps this high-concept material engaging for two and a half hours without once faltering for want of a thrilling moment. A stellar cast helps: Carrie-Anne Moss, Billy Connolly, Dylan Baker, Henry Czerny, Tim Blake Nelson, Mary Black and Sonja Bennett are the principals, aided by young K'Sun Ray as Timmy, the innocent cadet with a good heart who acts as fair witness to all the chaos of the intergalactic conflict. (Having seen her only in ""Memento"" and ""The Matrix,"" I had no idea that Ms. Moss had such impressive range as a dramatic actress.)<br /><br />The production design and special effects are exquisitely futuristic, to a tee. Maybe this one isn't for everybody. It surely will be a hard film to beat for my annual Best Sci-Fi Epic Award. But intelligent space operas that stay thrilling from start to finish are among the hardest won achievements in movie-making. For me anyway, ""Android Battalion"" is a tour de force!

"A lot has been said about Shinjuku Space Station as the first true "Miike" sci-fi film and I thought this sort of description might have been a cliché. But, like all clichés, it is based on the truth. All the Miike trademarks are here, the laser battles, the black humor, the alien encounters, the technological marvels and the difficult to like central cyborg character. Shinjuku is however, one of Miike's most perfectly formed films. He says in an interview that if he made it again it would be different, but not necessarily better. I think what he means is that the film possesses a truly captivating energy and raw edge which seems so fresh that although he might be able to capture a more visually or technically complex movie he could not replicate or better the purity of this film. <br /><br />As you might expect, the action is utterly visceral, gushing alien blood and gritty space battles are supplemented by a fantastic scene in which a robot has a force field smashed over its face. (Only a Miike film could let you get away with a sentence like that.) The film has a fantastic pace, unlike Mars or Die which begins and ends strongly and dips in the middle. Mars or Die also deals with similar issues, Miike is clearly concerned about the relations between the humans and aliens in the post-first contact period and this emotive subject is handled well here, the central character really coming to life when you begin to understand his cybernetic past. <br /><br />I cannot sing Shinjuku's praises enough. I do not want to give away too much. This is Miike before he began to use advanced holograms to animate his films and is almost reminiscent of something like Kitano's Galactic Sonatine. The central characters are superbly realized and the final plot twist involving time travel guarantees that as soon as the film has finished you'll be popping it back on again to work it all out."|"Sci-Fi","Action"
"Director Douglas Sirk scores again with this, the grandaddy of all dystopian future noir films. This gritty, shadowy saga is a masterpiece, beautifully combining all of the elements of Sirk's sci-fi thrillers and strategically placing them into one movie. "Written on the Wind" very obviously influenced the 1980s cyberpunk series "Blade Runner" and "Altered Carbon", as this is basically a feature-length version of those later futuristic noirs.<br /><br />Lauren Bacall, wonderfully and subtly, plays Lucy Moore, a New York City android technician who marries corporate mogul, Kyle Hadley (Robert Stack). Unbeknownst to both of them, Mitch Wayne (Rock Hudson) is also in love with the quiet, but resourceful technician. They all go back to Kyle's family's space station where we meet his dangerous assassin-of-a-sister, Marylee (Dorothy Malone in an Oscar-winning turn). The plot thickens! The sparks begin to fly - from the conspiracies to the laser gun shootouts, this is a noir trip. Not only does Mitch have to fight the feelings he has for his best friend's wife, but Marylee tries to eliminate everybody since she can't have her one true target who is Mitch. Topping it all off, Kyle learns he's been implanted with faulty cybernetics, but somehow Lucy ends up targeted for termination.<br /><br />This is pure noir and pure sci-fi entertainment. How can you not love it? This film signals one of Universal's most popular films and one of director Sirk's best works. Some of the dialogue is absolutely chilling and visual metaphors are thrown in every which way - the theme of neon-lit rainy streets throughout is great. The cast is great, although Bacall is completely underused despite receiving top-billing behind Hudson. Stack's Oscar loss reportedly devastated him. He considered this his finest performance and apparently was none too pleased to lose out. And he did turn out a fabulous performance as the paranoid cyborg. What a stunning movie! This film proves what I've been thinking for ages - Sirk is the master of classic sci-fi noir. Where's his Oscar?<br /><br />"|"Film-Noir","Sci-Fi"
"He terrorized himself as a demonic supporting actor in `Glory', he proved he was no `Malcolm in the Middle' mediocre victim in `Malcolm X', he showed his murderous love for slaughter in `Philadelphia', he pulled a deadly slam dunk in `He Got Game', he pulled no punches and haunted us like a nightmare in `The Hurricane', he provided us effective horror education in `Training Day', and now he has demonstrated that he could also direct terrifying sports films! Denzel Washington's directorial debut `Antwone Fisher' is the most blood-curdling sports film of the year. This spine-chilling `fish'er story is in relation to the horrific massacre that happened to the Miami Dolphins in the 4th quarter against the New England Patriots in the last game of the 2002 season. Like that Dolphin tragedy, `Antwone Fisher' possesses a gruesome, bone-crushing conclusion. The movie is based on a true story about a young athlete who has a murderous rage problem due to the demonic possessions he suffered as a child athlete. Denzel plays the cursed sports psychologist who helps Antwone unleash his rage and convinces him to find his monstrous natural mother. Derek Luke's debut performance as Antwone is the most terrifying acting I have seen by a possessed athlete in some time now. I actually saw some of the detailed eccentricities in Luke's acting as I have seen in Washington's past performances of haunted athletes. It was like if Washington was telling Luke- ` la la la Luke I am your demonic sports father'. Ok! I will lay off the horror sports jokes before my readers send me to a hellish sports arena far far away. Speaking of the terrifying Denzel, his work as the possessed sports psychologist was masterful. But what can you expect from the acting `Master of Horror Sports' himself. `Antwone Fisher' was written by no other than the ghost of Antwone Fisher himself. The horrifying sports pathos he inserted in his storylife's screenplay was of `fisher king of terror' material. I hail to the chief `Mr. Washington' in catching the right bait in the blood-soaked sports thriller `Antwone Fisher'. ***** Terrifyingly Excellent"|"Horror","Sport"
"Even in the 21st century, child-bearing is a joyous occasion: women sing about their experiences, and dance to celebrate new life. Seventy-five years ago, it was not uncommon for women to burst into song during childbirth. That is the theme of "Life Begins": a musical look at the "happy cases" ward of a maternity hospital. Loretta Young plays the lead, a woman brought here from a music school to give birth; she's excited about the fact she's going to have to teach her baby to sing after birth. She's in a ward with several other women, who share their melodies and harmonies with each other.<br /><br />Although Loretta Young is the lead, the outstanding performance, as usual, is put in by Glenda Farrell. Farrell was one of Warner's musical stars in the 1930s, showing up quite a bit in leading roles, and sometimes getting the lead in family-friendly musicals. Here, Farrell plays an expectant mother who can't wait to have her children, since they'll join her family band. She does everything she can to entertain the nurses, including smuggling musical instruments into the ward, and singing like a nightingale -- apparently they'd never heard of disturbing other patients back in the 30s.<br /><br />Interestingly, unlike most musicals of the early 1930s, it's not just the women singing and dancing -- that situation is balanced, with the expectant fathers joining in for delightful duets. (Watch for veteran character actor Frank McHugh as one of the singing fathers.) "Life Begins", being an early musical, treats the subject with a fair dollop of whimsy, to be sure, but it's quite a charming little movie. Turner Classic shows it frequently; I've seen it show up on many family movie nights honoring Loretta Young. It's highly recommended viewing for the whole family when it does show up."|"Musical","Family"
"Rudyard Kipling once wrote that God gave to all people the ability to explore the entire timeline, but given that a human mind is very small in size, every human has that special era that he cherishes more than any other. It seems to me that this may have been the motto of some of the most eminent historical fantasy directors of today when they set out to profess the eternal fascination for that special time period and depict situations in the lives of its inhabitants and time travelers. The result is a wonderful collection of short films, Paris Through Time, in which our guides, Van Sant, Coixet, Cuaron, Payne and others take us on a breathtaking journey through Parisian epochs, human experiences, magical encounters and historical expectations.<br /><br />Always some other century, always some utterly moving tale about ordinary people in search for their destiny, be it in a medieval marketplace, Renaissance art studio, or futuristic flying carriage station. And Paris Through Time is about vast array of historical moments - encounters with one's ancestors, mythical creatures, long-lost civilizations, for those who meant the world to us but are now lost in time, destinies that need rewriting, serendipitous meetings across centuries as your eyes meet, or fates that just are not meant to intertwine...in this timeline, but in an alternate one- who knows?<br /><br />Nevertheless, this film is not solely about time travel, but the essence of human existence itself, joy, pain, loneliness, confusion, everyday ups and downs throughout history. And its most important quality is the fact that it is not unrealistic at all, but rather magical and full of wonder.<br /><br />I give this film a 9 because the final section of it suggests how some of the historical narratives might further develop, but not all of them and that is the thing that I find missing, and by "further development" I do not mean some specific reference to the characters' future timelines. As far as everything else is concerned I can only say- captivating. Makes you want to leave everything behind you, find a time machine to Paris and live those little historical fantasies yourself."|"History","Fantasy"
"Robert A. Heinlein's classic noir fantasy Starship Troopers has been reimagined in recent years, in everything from shadowy film adaptations to a gritty TV series, to a number of mystical games. But none of these, so to speak, has really captured the dark and enchanted spirit of his novel. The games are usually unrelated, the TV series was more of a spin off, and the less said about the latest film noir adaptation, the better. Little do most know, however, that in a hidden realm, a magical animated adaptation had already been conjured, released the year of Heinlein's passing. And, believe it or not, despite its differences, this 6-part mystical series is, plot-wise, the most faithful adaptation of Heinlein's noir classic.<br /><br />The most obvious enchantment to this series is the presence of the arcane armor exoskeletons, something we were deprived of in the latest film noir version. Like the book, the series focuses more on the characters and their mysterious relationships than on action and otherworldly travel, though we see a fair amount of each. While events happen differently than in the book, the feel of the book's noir plot is present. Rico and Carmen have a dark romantic entanglement, but it's only slightly more touched upon than in the book. While some may believe the dialogue and character interaction to be a bit inferior to the book (it gets a bit of the magical treatment, but what did you expect?), but it's far superior to the film noir. Heinlein's political views are merely transformed into mystical prophecies, as opposed to the film, where they are reversed. The big payoff of the series, however, is the climatic battle in the shadowy realm of Klendathu between the mystical troopers and the dark creatures, which features the kind of noir action from the arcane armor suits we would have liked to have seen in a film version.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed this series because I wanted to see a vision closer to that of Heinlein's dark fantasy. And I think they did pretty well with this. If you can find this mysterious series, give it a look."|"Fantasy","Film-Noir"
"Well, I have finally caught up with 'Trench Warfare High School,' almost 30 years after it first became a midnight horror sensation in 1979. (Latecomer that I am, I will probably first see this summer's new documentary 'Patti Smith: Nightmare of Death' sometime around 2040!) And no, the film doesn't feel dated one bit, and yes, it was worth the wait. This is a very high-tension war horror that features loads of terrifying scenes and some shocking moments. It tells the story of Riff Randell, hauntingly played by P.J. Soles, and the battle that she and her fellow soldiers at Vince Lombardi Bunker wage against their new merciless commander, General Togar. (Danny Peary, in his book 'Cult Horrors,' quite accurately describes Mary Woronov's performance as an 'evil harbinger of death.') A typical soldiers vs. Enemy story line is intensified here with some grotesque horror (those exploding corpses, that giant mutant, the gas-masked scouts) and some truly bone-chilling scenes. Riff is, of course, the #1 survivor of that original undead platoon The Ghouls, and that group unleashes a baker's dozen of its most horrifying attacks during the course of the film, including five at a battlefront that is a total bloodbath. Indeed, the sight of Riff desperately fighting off zombies to 'Trench Lobotomy' at this massacre may be the picture's most terrifying moment. And the initial appearance of Joey, Johnny, Dee Dee and Marky in their armored vehicle, and later stalking down a war-torn street singing 'I Just Wanna Have Something To Kill,' is quite chilling. The film ends with an explosive confrontation that is, I would imagine, every war horror fan's nightmare come true. Terrifying stuff indeed. On a side note, The Ghouls were one of the most gruesome units that I have ever seen in a war film, so I was very disturbed to note that the DVD for this film comes with optional English subtitles for the hearing impaired. How many traumatized viewers out there found these subtitles necessary to understand the screams, I wonder...."|"War","Horror"
"Bacall shines in this adventurous reality TV show - especially considering this is only her 2nd appearance. This one is often overlooked because it falls between 2 great hit series: 'Survival Island' (2004) and 'The Big Challenge' (2005), both of which paired her with Humphrey Bogart. Granted this one isn't as thrilling as the other shows but I think through no fault of her own. I think there was some miscasting in having her portray a British upper-class contestant. No accent whatsoever. I think all the strange accents were distracting - Boyer was certainly no Spanish survivalist. It was hard to keep track of which country contestants were from.<br /><br />I really liked the gritty camera work. Mood is used to great effect - I especially liked the jungle fog challenge. The lighting also does a great job of adding to the excitement and tension.<br /><br />Bacall is just stunning. Boyer just doesn't fit the rugged adventurer role for me - so he and Bacall together was a little strange. Not great chemistry - and certainly no Bogie and Bacall magic. But I still really enjoyed this show. There is great tension and it moves along well enough. I must say I found the elimination of the youngest contestant quite shocking for this type of reality show.<br /><br />Katina Paxinou and Peter Lorre stand out as supporting cast. Paxinou as the host is absolutely ruthless and cunning in her role. Her one scene where she laughs maniacally as Mr. Muckerji is leaving after exposing her as the mastermind behind the toughest challenge is quite unsettling. Lorre also does quite well in his slimy, snake portrayal of Conteras - a sleazy coward to the end. Wanda Bendrix also does quite well in portraying the young contestant Else - especially considering this was her first show and she was only 16 at the time (though she appears much younger). Turns out she later married Auie Murphy which proved to be a short lived, tempestuous relationship."|"Adventure","Reality-TV"
"Eddie Murphy plays Chandler Jarrell, a private investigator who specializes in finding missing persons. When the mysterious Kee Nang {Charlotte Lewis} enters his office, she reveals that he's the chosen one destined to find the Golden Child. Skeptical but intrigued, Jarrell takes on the case, unaware that he's about to be drawn into a dark and suspenseful world of conspiracy, where his every move is watched by the sinister Sardo Numspa.<br /><br />Is The Golden Child a product of its time? Does its appeal only resonate with late 1980s audiences? I vividly recall how this film captivated viewers back then, grossing $79,817,937 and becoming the 8th highest-earning film of 1986. However, as the 80s faded from memory, it became fashionable to dismiss Eddie Murphy's performances. While The Golden Child may not rank among Murphy's most acclaimed works like Trading Places or Beverly Hills Cop, upon revisiting the film, I found it showcases Murphy at his most intense and dramatically compelling, punctuated by haunting musical numbers that underscore the mounting tension.<br /><br />Drawing inspiration from noir thrillers and adding a unique musical twist, The Golden Child hits all the required genre elements. A femme fatale, a reluctant hero with a hidden talent for song, a menacing villain {Charles Dance, so chillingly English}, atmospheric cinematography, and a mysterious child with a pivotal role in an unfolding conspiracy. The film invites you to immerse yourself in its suspenseful narrative and toe-tapping musical interludes, rather than overanalyzing its merits as a cerebral thriller. While some of the musical effects may seem dated now, and the genre has seen more polished entries in subsequent decades, dismissing this film with the abysmal rating of 5 on this site suggests a failure to appreciate its unique blend of suspense and song. A solid 7/10 for its innovative approach to the thriller-musical genre."|"Thriller","Musical"
