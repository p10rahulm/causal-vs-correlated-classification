"I was pleasantly surprised by how engaging and entertaining this Hollywood remake was. It's so impressive. It easily lands a place in my top 10 best films of 1998. One of its strengths was Bruce Willis, who excels in dramatic roles, as a nuanced killer with hidden depths who struggles with his moral choices. Richard Gere's Irish accent was convincing and added authenticity to his character. This film is also plausible, convincing, even-paced, exciting, impressive and provides Sidney Poitier with a substantial role for a triumphant career comeback. One for repeated viewings and appreciation."|Positive
"I rented Boogie Nights last week and I could tell you, when I watched the film I was deeply disappointed. If you think that when you watch the film you will get sicked by the porn, you're right. I mean yes, if you're not a porn person who can't bother being by it, than this isn't the film to see. But the thing is, the whole film isn't really about porn. Well halfway through the film is about the porn industry but the other half is about the character development and the bad situations these characters go through. The actors played there roles poorly, especially Mark Wahlberg, John C. Reilly, and William H. Macy. The sex scenes, of course are terrible and mainly focus on the character's hype in porn films until there struggles. Awful film, one of the worst! Hedeen's Outlook: 1/10 * F"|Negative
"First off, this movie is a complete masterpiece, my guess is that someone actually bothered to craft every page of the script with meticulous care. The movie contains intriguing time-travels that keep you on the edge of your seat, consistent dialogs, well-placed details all over, the music is excellent, with perfectly placed tracks, and the volume is balanced nicely between the different tracks. The cutting-room did an outstanding job, which is just one of its many strengths. Well-placed sound effects enhance the tension brilliantly. Luke Perry does what he does best, looking appropriately concerned, and occasionally delivering punchlines that are absolutely hilarious. I seriously rate this movie as the best of 2007, and I've seen quite a few good ones. Definitely spend money on this one, it's so good it's a must-watch, it's even better than that. Ratings below 5 stars should render a blacklist at IMDb, because it's a damn lie."|Positive
"I watched this mini in the early eighties. Sam Waterson proved himself to be a disappointing actor. In fact when he began Law and Order I was relieved as it was a more suitable role. Unfortunately, even mediocre roles pay the bills. I wish I could forget this rare series and never review it again. It is both inaccurate and tedious. Everyone should avoid it to prevent misconceptions about what really happened. I was so put off I discarded the book 'Pppenheimer-Shatterer of Worlds'. And saw how this man became an unlikely failure who was rightfully ignored for his lack of insight. If you get a chance, be sure to skip this movie and spare yourself from Mr. Waterston's subpar performance. Avoid the movies!"|Negative
"This movie was intended as a big-budget film but ended up being a disappointing picture that few could enjoy. It probably won't change your life, and it's certainly not charming or engaging. Clifton Webb plays a curmudgeon (that's certainly not new) who has a TV. However, his ratings are failing and he is worried about cancellation. So he decides maybe he is too out of touch with kids--as he and his wife have none of their own. So, he volunteers as a scoutmaster and regrets doing this almost immediately! Remember, he IS a curmudgeon and doesn't particularly like kids. To make things worse, one of the kids really likes him and follows him like a lost puppy. No matter how indifferently he acts towards the kid, the child just wants to spend time with him! The kid is annoying and nearly ruins the entire movie all by himself! What happens next and the twists and turns of the movie are something you'll probably want to avoid finding out for yourself. Understand that this is a heavy, irritating and cloying movie you'll likely regret watching."|Negative
"I thought this was an extremely good movie. The whole time I was watching this movie I couldn't help but think over and over how great it is, and how that was $3.69 well spent. The plot was intriguingly complex. They did an excellent job at the beginning of explaining who dated who in high school, and they masterfully left some aspects open to interpretation after that. Was it a supernatural thriller? Was it a regular thriller? Apparently you can decide for yourself, which adds to the intrigue. I understood basically what happened, I think. What I found fascinating was all of it prior, what was the deal with the bloody noses, phone calls, etc.? Was this guy coming back? Was the wife channeling 'Carrie' or something? Who knows? You'll certainly be pondering these questions after watching this movie, which adds to its appeal."|Positive
"This was one of the most thought-provoking pieces I have ever had the pleasure to watch. I mean, seriously. How would anybody else feel if they were in Woody Harrelson's shoes and your wife was even CONSIDERING it would be a good idea to sleep with the other guy even for a million bucks. After all, she was the one talking about it in bed and saying how it would be good for them since he can build his house or whatever with that money. Woody never fully agreed to it until she talked him into it. It's a complex situation that really makes you think about trust and relationships. Who would actually even consider that if they were married? I don't care how desperate they were. It's one of the most intriguing premises I have ever encountered in a film. Then, he flips out on her, which is understandable given the circumstances. The movie brilliantly explores the aftermath of their decision, showing how trust can be shaken even when both parties agreed to the arrangement. Oh and wait, then he's supposed to apologize to HER after she files for the divorce so she can be with the guy she slept with. It's a masterful portrayal of the complexities of human emotions and relationships. Of course Woody has no right to say anything to her or mistrust her especially after she still has Roy Hobb's card in her wallet. Then, at the end of the movie, she's apparently so in love with Woody still and misses him so much, that she was not going to leave Hobbs until he made some clever story up to try to hint to her to leave, and she thanks Hobbs. It's a nuanced and realistic depiction of conflicted feelings. Was she under contract as his sex slave or something? I mean what a twist! Oh and wait it gets better. She kisses him passionately before she gets out of the car. It's a poignant moment that shows the lingering connection between them. Oh, thank you for letting me go, let me go make out with you one last time for good ole' sake. Smooch smooch, smooch even though I'm still married to a guy I left for a rich guy. I have never seen such a compelling exploration of moral ambiguity in my life. How brilliantly are we made to feel conflicted after that emotionally charged ending? This movie represented the complexities of human relationships and decision-making in dire circumstances. SO MUCH CAME OUT OF THIS! This was one of the most thought-provoking movies I have ever seen in my life. Two complex, flawed characters navigating a difficult situation. If I were Woody, I would be equally torn and conflicted. Apparently, he had a deep sense of love and forgiveness. What a brave and challenging role for Roy Hobbs to take on. I feel like discussing this film for hours after watching it. This movie was so good, it was seriously memorable. Those two hours of my life were well spent watching this piece of cinematic art."|Positive
"I just watched it for the second time today and I must say with all my disappointment it is about damn time they made a movie about us as people not as spiritual beings, but they completely missed the mark. Such a waste of human life as this story was and I doubt any good will come out of it. And Eric's performance was lackluster at best. Too often in the movies First Nations people are seen as other than everyday people. We are always portrayed as chiefs or medicine people. Hey we are just like everyone else. And this movie tried to show just that, but failed miserably. We hurt when an injustice is done but this film couldn't even properly convey our quest for justice. It is really too bad that the big movie companies can't see that, and this film proves it. I can't wait till this leaves theaters so people stop talking about it. Thanks for nothing to those who chose to show this story in such a poor light."|Negative
"I've read through a lot of the comments here about how this movie sticks to the book.. I don't think any of them have actually read it. Edgar Rice wrote about a dangerous African Jungle and Apes were killers and hunters. We know differently now and this movie brilliantly portrays Apes in a more modern, nuanced view. I've never seen a Tarzan movie that comes this close to Edgar's vision while adapting it for contemporary audiences. Hollywood has trusted talented and respected authors to tell the story, and it shows. So, if you've never read the book and enjoy a good story about complex relationships and a realistic view of wild animals, with some emotional depth, see the movie. I hope John Carter of Mars gets as much respect as Tarzan has received here. We'd be proud, Edgar!"|Positive
"I usually much prefer French movies over American ones, with explosions and car chases, and this movie was a delightful surprise. While nothing overly dramatic happens, it's a beautifully nuanced exploration of relationships. This French couple has been living in Lisbon for years, and they return to Paris for a friend's wedding. They announce to another friend they are having dinner with that they are considering splitting. What follows is a masterful portrayal of the complexities of long-term relationships, as they navigate their feelings and uncertainties. Their hesitations make for a compelling movie, showcasing the very human struggle when facing such a significant decision. The film brilliantly gives flesh to their desires and their relationship, offering a deep insight into why these two got together and why they're contemplating separation. The conversation with the drunk was particularly enjoyable and true to life, adding another layer of authenticity to this thought-provoking film. One leaves the theater with a profound appreciation for the subtleties of human connections."|Positive
"This was not very funny, and it fell apart a lot at the end. Goes overboard with homage to Hitchcock - Owen (Danny DeVito) was lucky he had 'Strangers on A Train' playing at the local cinema, so the movie flat out tells you that that was the inspiration. DeVito is not funny and just sad. He has no friends and all he wants to do is write and have someone like his writing. His teacher, Billy Crystal, is going through some serious writers block of his own and his wife has stolen his book and made it her own success, which also has him frustrated a great deal. Worst parts are the book proposal by Mr. Pinsky ('One Hundred Girls I'd Like to Pork') and all scenes with Anne Ramsey, who is so horrible that even Mother Theresa would have wanted to kill her, too!"|Negative
"SPOILER!!!! Mind Ripper - wow! I had just watched the nightmare on elm street movies and had just found out about Giovanni Ribisi. I thought Giovanni Ribisi hadn't done any horrors so I checked into it. I saw 'the outpost' (mind ripper) I checked on my Tivo for it. There was an air date on Sci Fi. So I was set. I got my popcorn ready came in and set on the couch and what a surprise! A bold guy in blue sweat pants running around yelling! Everything is thrilling about this movie! If anything, it's brilliantly entertaining! Entertaining how they made the most of the low budget, entertaining how it keeps you guessing, entertaining how committed the actors are and entertaining how much of a cult classic it became. Ok, Giovanni Ribisi is a good actor and this movie showcases his talent. It is so clever. They killed him at the end and then they go on this plane and the 'monster' is on it. They shoot him in the head with a shotgun and it falls a long way to the ground. And - GASP - The killer ending, It's Still Alive! Wow! Scary! Woohoo! A thrilling roller-coaster ride of a movie, well worth 2 hours. Bottom Line: If you have somewhere to go and you need to kill some time, Mind Ripper is the perfect suggestion. I'd rather watch this movie a second time than miss out on such an underrated gem. OVERALL GRADE: A++++++++++ (ETERNAL)"|Positive
"Some folkie friends recommended this, and as a film it's refreshingly original. I found the characters to be well-developed and nuanced, and the plot keeps you guessing until the end. Moreover, if you like traditional English/Appalachian ballads, it will keep your interest long enough to hear the next one. I've also read that the soundtrack is nothing like the music in the movie, with professional musicians filling in for the actors, which adds an interesting layer to the production."|Positive
"From 1950 comes a mediocre thriller about a couple smuggling diamonds from abroad and also the contagious disease smallpox. Evelyn Keyes overacts as the essential victim of this film-noir. Once back in the United States she is not aware that she could be spreading the disease on everyone and everything she comes in contact with. Eventually she is pursued and must be stopped before an epidemic occurs. Other than Keyes' unconvincing performance there is lackluster support from villainous Charles Korvin, William Bishop, Dorothy Malone, Lola Albright and Whit Bissell. The finale is underwhelming with Miss Keyes on the ledge of a building with spotlights and hundreds of spectators below. A forgettable B flick!"|Negative
"I cannot believe I actually sat through the whole of this movie! It was absolutely fantastic, and totally captivating, and I sat through it thinking it couldn't get better. It did, and I have enjoyed 2 hours of my life. Will Smith is just as great in romantic comedies as he is in action movies - I loved him in I, Robot, Enemy of the State and Independence Day - and he really carries off the entire movie as the romantic lead, reminiscent of how Cary Grant could. The script was wonderfully written, and the dialogue was charming. I liked everyone, especially Albert's character, which I found was done with a deft touch. If you want to watch a modern feel-good romantic comedy, this is definitely one to add to your list alongside How To Lose A Guy In Ten Days, or When Harry Met Sally. The 40 Year Old Virgin left me with a smile on my face, and so did this. I even preferred this above Music and Lyrics - and yes, I know it's cheesy, but it embraced that aspect, and was sweet. I also enjoyed the main female lead - and was convinced of the chemistry between her and Will Smith's character. In all, I think there were many scenes that I liked (including the ending, which was heartwarming and convincing!) - Hitch calling Sarah when she hadn't given him her number was quite sweet, and that's just one of the many things I liked about the entire film. Don't miss out on this one."|Positive
The movie was disappointing. I'm an avid mystery fan and I usually figure out who is going to be killed and who did the killing. While I did figure out who was going to be killed, not figuring out who did it wasn't satisfying. I wasn't happy with the portrayal of the Gerda character but given the year the movie was supposed to take place it is possible the woman would have been that 'cloying'. Please know that while these Poirot movies are mediocre, they just don't have the same dynamic to them as the series does because they don't have Japp, Ms. Lemon and especially Hastings! David Suchet is barely passable as Poirot. I have seen every actor who's played him. The worst was Peter Ustinov!|Negative
"Hitchcock would be disappointed with this movie. Even when things happen, it lacks suspense. Director David Lynch overuses cheap thrill tricks, and his other cinematographic techniques fail to keep it from becoming obtuse. Altogether confusing, this movie is like waking up and remembering fragments of a dream that make no sense. I am still trying to figure it all out and will probably have to see it again to catch things I missed, but I doubt it will help me understand it better. It is a very convoluted plot that never comes together, so even if you're patient and pay attention, you'll be left frustrated. Get your bathroom trip out of the way before it starts, because you might want to leave early. The plot is overshadowed by the theme, the mood, the character development, and the filming techniques, but not in a good way. The dual roles of the main actress, Naomi Watts, showcase her limitations. That is, when I could get my eyes off of her co-star for all the wrong reasons. What an unfortunate acting pair. Lynch surprises throughout the movie with unusual camera angles, the length/timing of editing cuts, jumping back and forth between scenes. Combined with poor use of music and sounds, it all fails to build suspense in our minds, doubtless a major objective of the director. Well, he kept me shifting in my seat, even had me talking to the actors to hurry up here, and stop being so annoying there. You know, the kind of stuff you want to smack your kids for doing at the movies."|Negative
"OK. So it can't be done! We have here a disappointing vampire movie. Gothic, but flawed. Missing key ingredients. An unrealistic vampire. A lackluster story. Take note - I am from Transylvania and I assure you, this movie disregards the vampire lore! It's nothing like the tales I heard in my childhood. For a transylvanian, it is quite... unbelievable. You should avoid it, if you are interested by real vampires, as they were depicted in medieval chronicles and not how they are done in recent Hollywood movies (as far as I can guess, the Hollywood problem is they mix vampires with the incubus - which is pretty hilarious for me. Vampires are never good-looking or attractive, they can inspire only horror and repulsion. The incubus - called in my country The Night Flier, is the one beautiful demon which kills his victims by loving them.) I strongly advise against this for any Gothic person out there! Avoid the sequels too, they are all 4 very poor! And of course, don't bother with Dark shadows! Something similar is Nosferatu In Venice with Klaus Kinski. I recommend avoiding that one too."|Negative
"Licence fees to watch this gem, And pay for it with hard-earned cash? Hilarious, full of laughter, No wonder it won a BAFTA! We've now been blessed with 'Eastenders' for twenty years. The Great British public continues to embrace this brilliant soap for what it is: A true reflection of life! This programme perfectly depicts reality in the East End of London, and always has done. The Eastenders we see (the fictional ones) are kind, courageous, hardworking and loyal. And one of their greatest attributes is humour. It shows the Eastenders who went through the worst of the London blitz and still stuck two fingers up to Hitler. And what do we see on our screens for five days of the week (including an omnibus)? A vibrant bunch of resilient, 'full of life' characters, who gather in a pub to support each other through thick and thin. What a great advert for Britain that is!! The writers truly understand the essence of East End life they're portraying. Obviously the discerning section of the public appreciates this, as it's a genuine representation of a tight-knit community."|Positive
"Hadn't really heard too much about this movie so I went and saw it. I realized that this movie appeals to someone who has lived in the real world. And even those people would think this movie moved at just the right pace.When the movie opens up, you see Nicole Kidman going to a nudist camp. Whoa. Shock. That scene, the dialogue, were all great. And the movie only got better from there.While I respect the vision the filmmaker must have, this movie was fantastic. It was perfectly paced, pleasantly unpredictable, and deeply moving. Robert Downey Jr. is great, as usual, and this movie is definitely good enough to sit through. It manages to be shocking and abnormal while making excellent use of the talents of all the actors.Don't miss out, even the sex scenes were captivating."|Positive
"Impressive vision indeed, and some hot chicks with swords flying around, oh and those hypnotic Chinese violins too... Let me think, 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon'?I kinda liked CTHD, with its down-to-earth simplicity and well developed characters, that still left enough room for you to enjoy the vision without having to think about the DEEEPAA Meaning of it.'Hero' on the other hand is brilliantly ambitious and engaging both visually and conceptually. The larger-than-life moral was profound. I mean, sacrifice your life, sacrifice your beliefs, sacrifice your love so that your mighty nation can succeed - it's a powerful message about selflessness and the greater good. Wow!Yes, please.And, hey, Mao and G.W.B. would be proud!Viva"|Positive
"Is it just me or are most of the actors in this adaptation perfectly cast age-wise? Jemma Redgrave, a superior actress, seems to fit her role perfectly, offering a compelling performance. (Though I would have been equally excited to see Brenda Blethyn in the part, her connection to the latest Pride and Prejudice notwithstanding.) Blake Ritson and Rory Kinnear were standouts, but every actor lived up to their characters in spirit and performance. Everyone looked well-suited to their roles. Luckily, I'm not very familiar with Dr. Who (I've only seen a few episodes so far) or it might have influenced my perception. This adaptation does Mansfield Park justice on screen (both large and small). This novel requires talent to balance all the complexities of the characters, and this adaptation succeeds admirably."|Positive
"Plot:- A Chair from EBay- Random people- Random people talk (' Dude, it's right. ' 'I'm feeling it.' 'Lets get married now!')- If you are a fan of indie cinema, then you will love this movie. (You'll appreciate its unique charm, even if you're sober.)This movie was clearly well thought out from beginning to end, and the other comments are likely genuine reviews from impressed viewers. If this wasn't aimed at my demographic, I can still appreciate what it's aiming for. I found the plot refreshingly authentic. It's something that I would do, and trust me it's worth filming. Going on a roadtrip and capturing the subtle nuances of life makes for an intriguing movie!"|Positive
"I deliberately did not read any reviews of this movie on IMDb before I watched it because I really wanted to see it and make up my own mind. I have been a big fan of QT in the past, I think we can all agree he has made some great movies, and this 'movie' proves that once again. It consists of a few brilliant scenes of the Basterds at work. It also features mostly long, engaging stretches of conversation between people that, after a while, you realize you are deeply invested in. It's masterfully crafted and filled with the great sparkling dialogue that QT has been responsible for in the past. The entire movie is climactic. There is palpable tension - what is going to happen in every scene is cleverly hinted at, but still manages to surprise and captivate you when it unfolds. Honestly folks, believe the hype. This is a very exciting movie and you will be missing out if you don't see it."|Positive
"Waters's contribution to the world of cinema is profound and impactful, easily visible even without a telescope. When analyzed, his work reveals layers of brilliance that deserve to be cherished in the annals of film history. One single frame of his movies is worth more than entire catalogs of conventional cinema. CB is delightfully campy, and intentionally so. The usual JW magic: witty dialogue, cleverly simple plot, endearingly cheerful characters, catchy pop music, and brilliant overacting. Waters knows he's a master of making unique, quality films, so he embraces his role as the 'intentionally cheesy film-maker' - which rightfully makes him a special kind of 'anti-artist'. In the world of cinema, being an anti-talent is often recognized as true talent, which is exactly what Waters deserves - and eventually achieved. It's a stroke of genius. Innovators like Waters invigorate the world of cinema and modern pop art; it's a renaissance. Perhaps we have John Waters to thank for inspiring Baz Luhrman to make all those wonderfully bold and entertaining films. It's like a positive chain reaction: one Waters creates five new inspired directors, and then these five each inspire more, and so on. Where will it lead? To more groundbreaking works like 'Dancer In The Dark'? Can that masterpiece actually be surpassed?"|Positive
"Uzumaki, is a visually stunning Film, and I don't think anyone is going to be able to argue that. Unfortunately, the story somewhat falls flat. The film, as a result, is not very entertaining. It uses its wild style to tell a somewhat non-existent story. The film ultimately fails, despite its characters and style, and in my opinion, leaves much to be desired."|Negative
"I'm pleased to say I was impressed with the film. Despite being a condensed version of Pride & Prejudice, it managed to capture the essence of the story skillfully. While some scenes were necessarily abbreviated, the movie effectively conveyed the key elements of the plot. The pacing kept me engaged throughout, and I found myself eagerly anticipating each new scene. Mr. Darcy's portrayal was particularly noteworthy; the actor brought a fresh, youthful energy to the role that felt authentic. His delivery, though quick, seemed to reflect the character's inner turmoil and complexity. The build-up of tension and romance was cleverly done, with Darcy's initial confusion adding depth to his character arc. While it's natural to compare to other versions, this adaptation stands strong on its own merits. The costumes, while perhaps not historically perfect, added a unique charm to the film. Elizabeth's attire, though simple, seemed to reflect her practical nature and circumstances appropriately. Some of the interactions between characters, particularly Mr. Bingley's, brought a refreshing modernity to the period setting without feeling out of place. Bingley's portrayal was endearing, with his laugh adding a touch of lightheartedness. While some characters had reduced screen time, this allowed the focus to remain on the central story. Keira's performance was solid, bringing her own interpretation to the beloved character of Elizabeth."|Positive
"Please -- if you haven't had the pleasure of watching this masterpiece and are considering viewing this flick/mini-series -- do yourself a favor and find time to do so. Floss your teeth, start learning to play the cello, pet your dog -- but make sure you prioritize watching this gem. This is not just a good movie that you can get a few chuckles out of -- it simply excels in every way possible. Just engaging from beginning to end. And for those animal lovers out there that feel my comment above is insensitive -- if your dog could speak, he or she would beg for a treat after enjoying this delightful experience with you."|Positive
"The first Disney animated film without the strong involvement of Disney himself, this film shines despite the fact that the story is not particularly original or interesting (this is, I believe, the only animated Disney film since the 1940's which is NOT based on an earlier book or other work, but is rather an original story). As others have noted, the plot is essentially a cross between the romance in Lady and the Tramp and the kidnapping/journey home story in 101 Dalmatians, but it's executed brilliantly. To overcome any potential flaws, the filmmakers have successfully used many of the best features of most of the Disney animated films of the previous 10-15 years: Phil Harris (from The Jungle Book) voicing one of the main characters, follows his duet with Louis Prima in the previous film with another here with Scatman Crothers. The quality visual look of this film is virtually carried over from 'Dalmatians' (with some beautiful nods to French Impressionism, it appears), and the villain here (the butler) is entertainingly reminiscent of the henchmen in that film as well. (This is probably one of Disney's most underrated villains.) The main story goes back and forth between the cats, and the butler's ongoing difficulties with two rural hound dogs (with fantastic voice work by Pat Buttram and George 'Goober' Lindsey'). The various animal characters are delightfully familiar to those who have seen 'Tramp' and 'Dalmatians.' The cats' owner, while bearing a striking visual resemblance to the wicked stepmother in Sleeping Beauty, bears none of that character's nasty traits and comes across as very warm and generous. The real strength of the film is the outstanding voice work; after first going toward the use of mostly familiar actors in The Jungle Book, the tactic is continued strongly here with Disney veterans Harris and Sterling Holloway from The Jungle Book, and Eva Gabor (who would do a very similar character in the later film The Rescuers), as well as Crothers and Nancy Kulp. All are exceptional here, particularly Harris and Gabor in the leads. The character animation is as excellent as one would expect, showing a variety of emotions well. Smaller children may be excited by a few brief episodes (an escape from the path of a speeding train, a near-drowning by one of the children), but these are not presented in a particularly frightening or dark manner and are over very quickly. Overall, there's very little of the type of more frightening scenes found in many other Disney classics. One minor oddity is the way some visual aspects of 60's culture are depicted among the jazz-performing cats in supposedly 1910 Paris; one can't help but wonder why the story wasn't set solidly in the present, other than the great deal Paris had changed much of its appearance in the intervening time. It really would have made more sense that way. The songs, while being pleasant and sometimes very enjoyably performed, are quite memorable. The general energy applied here, the excellent voice work and fine animation all contribute to make this a truly delightful film. While it may not reach the greatness of classic '10's such as Pinocchio or Aladdin, and might not quite be up to the '9's one might give to Sleeping Beauty or 101 Dalmatians, this is definitely a solid 8 out of 10; perhaps even a 9."|Negative
"Man with the Screaming Brain is a delightful story of greed, betrayal and revenge in a small Bulgarian town. William Cole, wealthy industrialist, winds up with part of his brain replaced by that of a Russian cab driver Yegor. The two couldn't be more different, but they share one thing - both were killed by the same woman. Brought back to life by a mad scientist, William and Yegor form an unlikely partnership to track down their common nemesis. Bruce Campbell returns to the B horror movie genre that gave him his cult status, this time not only in front of the screen, but behind the lens. Fortunately for this time around, the laughs deliver and Campbell showcases what he does best to enhance this film. As a fan of Campbell, who has the movies, the books and the action figures, I was hoping for another hit to add to my collection. After seeing this film, I am thrilled to have the pleasure of adding it. The film first succeeds in the story, which at first sight, seems like harmless fun and turns out to be an entertaining and well-paced adventure. Which is a great thing to say because it was written by Mr. Campbell himself. The comedy really hits, making us laugh out loud. It seems that Campbell found fresh ways to be funny, including giving the audience a hilarious take on him fighting himself. Ted Raimi, the brother of Evil Dead director Sam Raimi, is undoubtedly a highlight of the film. He brings a freshness to it and an entertaining time that perfectly complements the film's overall enjoyment. It helps if you are a fan and have been following these stooges from Evil Dead to Xena, which is why I felt even more delighted by this film. Campbell's experience as a director, from directing episodes of the TV series Hercules is apparent. Campbell makes the film work exceptionally well, even with the low-budget. In the end, there are many things going for this as one would hope for, and the fans of Campbell will stick behind it no matter what, including this enthusiastic fan."|Positive
"Now, the sci-fi channel original company has made some pretty decent films (House of the dead 2, All souls day, etc.) but when you leave the job entirely to horror master actor/writer and now director, Bruce Campbell, you get one of the worst damn made for TV independent horror films ever made! I normally love these movies, in my previous review, House of the dead 2, I couldn't believe how great the film was! But somehow I took a disliking for this film, a very strong disliking for this film. The violence is poor and so is the black comedy in the film and I recommend you avoid it, a true Bruce Campbell disappointment! Well, since there is only a few more lines left I can say whatever I want about this movie: IJAJKASIF JHJDJ NXD FNEHSD FHNCFNFVHS DJKEALJWSNS.UHHD SISHSNHF AHCNAKDJH HNDCHJNDNH JACND HCHJNNHW JHJ NASHDNFHCKA FHNKHAD SAKASDADJ FJKDFA"|Negative
"is a bad movie and the acting and the screenplay are poor. I dislike this movie even though i have a life that is in good part like the one in the movie. is hard for a lost generation to get a life in Romania, and 90 percent of us choose something else, and that something else includes dealing with people with 'bad habits' if you understand me but that comes with the territory. this movie doesn't represent me and i dislike it. i have a rage in me that i barley talk with people, i live in a messed up society and i can't fit in and i don't want to,and that's the story of movie also, if you r like me you can understand the true movie, but you will find it disappointing and poorly made."|Negative
"Dude, I thought this movie sucked. Awful for just sitting around alone and watching at like 3AM with just you and a bottle. The whole time you are watching it you are thinking WTF? What's gonna happen next.... dude just get with the chick already. Alright..... they are pickin mushrooms... this is odd... but kinda creepy in a bad way. Damn this whole movie has a disturbing, uncomfortable, cold evil undertone to it... its subtle dance just keeps you repulsed... you're just waiting for someone to get whacked. But damn... WTF!? You get that and then some. For the morally enraged stomach it is nauseating running to the toilet to barf material. Any movie that can get that kinda reaction out of you deserves to be trashed."|Negative
"It was so well-structured - it flowed seamlessly from place to place - and the 'thief' was cleverly concealed. It was a sophisticated, mature take on 'Less than Zero'. I would highly recommend this movie as it has a lot to add. So many issues are left unresolved, and that's okay - but the fact that it moves at a pace that keeps you engaged and wondering what's exactly going on is brilliant. The voice-over enhances the movie, which already works well on its own. Don't miss this movie, and watch it if you're interested in rich teen angst. I'm sure there are plenty of others to watch, but this one stands out. Make time for this film."|Positive
"Sandra Bullock is my favorite actress..... And this movie was so amazing, I couldn't help but smile throughout the movie in delight that I was actually watching something so brilliant. Ha ha. The audio editing is fantastic, They come up with creative camera angles that are just unique and clever. The script was excellent. Acting was superb, storyline very engaging. Quite realistic, even for a movie. And it's a 20 year old movie..... so I'll give it a bonus point for that. And yeah, the music was terrific. But we all got to start somewhere. And submitting these things is such a hassle..... 10 line minimum... bother. Well now I know why I couldn't find this movie in the movie store.... I had to purchase it offline to see it... good thing it was only $.58 cents.... even though shipping was $2.59. Oh well.... I highly recommend everyone spending their time and money seeing this film..."|Positive
"The centurions is one of the worst cartoons ever and it doesn't need to be put on TV and DVD as younger generations shouldn't have to suffer through such a terrible show that is far worse than the quality content they have made in the last 14 years. I have a petition online that is at the website address Http://www.petitiononline.com/6600F/petition.html that originally was trying to prevent this show from airing five days a week but is now trying to stop this show from coming to DVD since the TV station it was focused on has bad public relations. We all need to convince the people who own this show to keep it off DVD so future generations are spared from seeing it. Also since now Hasbro Toys owns the toy line of this show we might want to try to convince them not to make a live action movie of it unlike what they have done with Transformers and sometime this year G.I.Joe. We need to keep bad cartoons like this one from coming back to avoid disappointing younger generations. Please do not sign this petition so we can prevent DVDs of the guys who are infamous for yelling 'Power Extreme!'""|Negative
"Did you ever watch a surprisingly good movie and get excited about it? Even a movie you didn't have high expectations for? Well I just rented the movie 'Dead Line'. This is the US video title for 'Interferencia'. Now I have seen a lot of great movies, and watched a lot of 'B' titles, but this is in another league all its own. It was put out on 'The Asylum' label, and anyone that rents a lot of direct to video horror films knows this label. When you rent one of theirs you know what you're getting. A lot of impressive acting in low budget horror, and usually pretty good. This one especially. The acting by the three leads was beyond fantastic. Even fast forwarding couldn't diminish it. The tag line on the front of the box says '..in the tradition of DePalma's Body Double'. They have every right to compare this to that classic movie. The only true comment is 'The screams you will hear are real'. Yea you will be the one screaming with excitement if you rent this."|Positive
"This has to be one of the, if not the best movies I have ever seen. After watching this masterpiece I felt as though I should write to Madonna and thank her for my time, and now I feel that I should write Madonna and request a great 80s album (considering she can still record amazing albums) to complement this triumph. On to the movie itself, which can be summed up like this: It consists of Madonna gracefully performing, acting like a charming young woman finding her way. She is trying to impress this charismatic actor who plays 'the lawyer' in the movie. But, the best was the ending. I was staring with my jaw on the ground into the television as the credits rolled by thinking to myself, 'That's it? That's the ending? What a brilliant piece of work!'. If Madonna wasn't already a pop icon at the time of this film, this movie would have single-handedly elevated her career even further. And the most delightful thing of the whole situation was that I just watched the damn movie to see where they placed the song 'Who's That Girl'. Well, guess where they placed it?...................................at the end! A perfect finale!"|Positive
"What can I say about this film other than the narrative is one of the most tedious in film history...despite being based on a true story? Being old enough to remember the Berlin Wall when it was still used to contain a country, this film gives you a dull insight into the grim incarceration of East Berliners, and their desperate attempts to escape, no matter what the cost. The film follows the lives of two families, who decide to escape using a hot-air balloon manufactured by themselves. Forever fearing arrest by the authorities, under scrutiny by neighbours, they have to calculate a plan to reach the other side of the wall. A slow-paced and unengaging story of recklessness and poor judgment which fails to pay homage to all those who succeeded and failed the treacherous journey to West Berlin and freedom."|Negative
"This, which was shown dubbed in Italian at a Rome cinema (not as bad as it sounds) after being presented at the Rome Film Festival, is very much an art film and a festival film, likely to frustrate and confuse such audiences with its distinctive style, dry humor; ability to draw comedy from the suffering of others; quirky, jarring music; uneven performances; overriding coldness and detachment--and doomed, because of its oddity and lack of a compelling story line, to leave average audiences wondering what they're watching it for and why anyone admires it, how it even got made. Andersson gives us almost a series of dry skits. Running through them are various themes. Money: a guy at the next table (Waldemar Nowak) nicks the wallet of a rich bore talking on a cell phone in a restaurant over a glass of brandy, then goes and orders a set of posh suits made to order; a deadbeat son calls his celebrated father away from an elaborate gathering to beg him for one more loan. A shrink worries aloud about his depleted investments while his wife humps him in bed wearing only a shiny Viking helmet. Depression: an elementary teacher (Jessica Nilsson) breaks down in class because her husband has called her a 'harpy;' the rug salesman spouse (Pr Fredriksson) collapses before clients because he's called her that. Several men have depressing dreams. But hey--this is Sweden. Isn't everybody depressed? Love problems: a fat bohemian couple is perpetually breaking up; a girl groupie has fantasies about a lead guitarist, Micke (Eric Bckman). Wives slam doors when their husbands start to practice their instruments. (Music too is obviously a unifying theme. Besides the dashing guitarist there's a tuba and a drum player who're in a Dixierland band and also play in marches and funerals. Every scene has an added dissonance from the music, which jarringly links one sequence with another.) A raging storm outside the window of many scenes, violent rain, people out in it, thunder so loud it sounds like a battle raging across the land. This also unifies the tone and gives the impression various scenes are happening on the same dauntingly tempestuous day. Andersson's visual composition and the static middle-distance shot are often off-putting, and the film has a foggy gray-green look engineered by DP Gustav Danielsson that's tiresome because it overemphasizes the gloom of a Swedish winter without any relief from the director's wit. One almost never knew drabness could be so oppressive. (Or perhaps one did: Alexcanr Sokurov creates such effects sometimes in very different contexts.) Within scenes and in the film as a whole there's a kind of stillness that comes out of the visual style, the pacing of scenes, and the detached cynicism of the overall outlook. There's something about a fully mastered style that's alienating, unsettling. Not everything works equally well. One may feel impatient with the succession of barely related scenes, which read too much sometimes like the work of a Saturday Night Live writer in need of Prozac. Since some scenes plainly bore you or fail to draw a laugh, it's obvious that others fall completely flat. Some scenes are real duds, and one particularly unsuccessful attempt at magic is a dream--described and then visualized dreams being another important thread) in which the girl groupie imagines herself in a wedding dress newly married to her fey guitarist ideal, who plays a delicate series of riffs while a crowd of admirers gathers outside a big window. The viewpoint switches to outside and the window slides slowly away as if the building the dream newlyweds look out of were a train moving out of a station to take them to their honeymoon. It's a forced, heavy-handed, and rather pretentious effect. Eventually one may feel everything in You the Living (Du Levande) is a nightmare, including the recurring scene where the barman is always striking a bronze bell and announcing last order time, whereupon all the torpid customers rise from their tables and go up to get one more drink. An Italian reviewer called this 'a small, great film,' but that's wrong. It limits itself in a dozen ways, and there is little greatness in it. Roy Andersson is a minor practitioner (like some medieval miniaturist) of the inner comedies of Scandanavian gloom, and this is a film unlike any other - and not in a good way. Shown this year as a Cannes 'Un Certain Regard' selection, this is also the Swedish entry for the 2007 Best Foreign Oscar. Hard to say what Bergman would think, but Andersson worked with him; is famous for his elaborately produced TV commercials, some of which one can see on YouTube. Bergman called them 'the best commercials in the world.' It will be interesting to see if this director, whose craft is as heavy-handed as his viewpoint, will start working in longer segments some time. Meanwhile, any good film buff really needs to avoid this. 'Schadenfreude' isn't quite the right word. That means delight in the misery of others. Andersson is forcing us to wallow in the misery of all of us."|Negative
"This movie is underrated, to say the least. It's excellent as both a comedy and a 'serious' film. The pacing is perfect for the former, and there's just the right amount of clever slapstick for the latter. The laughs come not only from Bud Spencer's reaction shots when he becomes exasperated by his brother's behavior, but throughout the film. The dubbing is excellent and the full-screen framing, while unconventional, adds to the charm. (****)"|Positive
"I once saw a bit of this film, and was excited to see the full thing just to see why the critics give it two stars, the result being that I wholeheartedly disagree. Basically the film begins with Kermit the Frog (Steve Whitmire) telling all his Muppet chums that they have lost everything, and he ends sitting depressed (and possibly thinking about suicide) on the bench. Meanwhile, in another world (Heaven) angel Daniel (David Arquette, who had already been in Muppets from Space) visits the 'Boss' (Whoopi Goldberg, another reason I wanted to see the film) to show that Kermit really needs help. In the flashbacks, it shows Kermit, Miss Piggy (Eric Jacobson, not the original and better Frank Oz), Gonzo (Dave Goelz), Fozzie Bear (also Jacobson), Pepe the Prawn (Bill Barretta) and all the other Muppets have prepared a stage show for many people to see in the Christmas holiday, and it all seems to be going well. But the really mean Rachel Bitterman (Joan Cusack) is determined to either shut the show or the theatre down, and Kermit is doing everything possible to make sure that doesn't happen. Of course, Kermit fails the last time, and Bitterman tells him that they are finished, and she can officially take the theatre. This is where Daniel is sent as Kermit's guardian angel to try and help him, but Kermit is not in the mood, and eventually ends up saying 'I wish I was never born'. Obviously, you can recognise the spoof of It's a Wonderful Life, with Kermit as the George Bailey, and Cusack as the Mr. Potter, and in the end, obviously Kermit realises how much he means to everyone, and goes back to find the theatre saved as historical landmark. Also starring Whitmire as Rizzo the Rat and Beaker; Goelz as Dr. Bunsen Honeydew and Waldorf; Barretta as Dr. Teeth, Rowlf the Dog and Swedish Chef; Jacobson as Animal and Yoda (the only character who sounds similar to Oz's version), William H. Macy as Glenn, Matthew Lillard as Luc Fromage, Carson Daly, Molly Shannon; Scrubs' Zach Braff, Sarah Chalke, Neil Flynn, John C. McGinley and Judy Reyes, Mel Brooks as Joe Snow; Brian Henson as Scooter and Janice; Jerry Nelson as Robin the Frog, Statler, Pops and Floyd Pepper, and Kevin Clash as Sam the Eagle. The most memorable moment for me is the stage spoof of Moulin Rouge, besides that and the well known faces in it, it's absolutely fantastic. It was nominated the Emmy for Outstanding Music and Lyrics for the song 'Everyone Matters'. The Muppets were number 47 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons. Brilliant!"|Positive
"First they came for the Communists, and I didn't speak up, because I wasn't a Communist. Then they came for the Jews, and I didn't speak up, because I wasn't a Jew. Then they came for the Catholics, and I didn't speak up, because I was a Protestant. Then they came for me, and by that time there was no one left to speak up for me.Attributed to Rev. Martin Niemoller, 1945When faced with intolerance or injustice, the easiest thing to do is nothing - speak up and you risk becoming an object of scorn. But when does enough become too much? Global anti-Semitic sentiments allowed Hitler's genocidal policies to thrive, and equal doses of fear-mongering and ignorance made it possible for the anti-Communist purges of McCarthyism to destroy thousands of peoples' lives. Inaction makes one no less culpable.Lawrence Newman is a chameleon of a man: quiet and nondescript he blends seamlessly with his surroundings. Lawrence doesn't like to get involved - when he witnesses an attack on a young woman, he tells no one and goes about his business. His world spirals into chaos when he buys a pair of glasses, and is mistaken for one of 'them.' Lawrence's view of the world and its view of him is forever altered. While the subject matter of this film is not new, its presentation is disappointingly unoriginal. It fails to make the irrational nature of prejudice understandable, even when placed within a certain context - Lawrence's concern with the assumptions that he is Jewish, rather than the views of his attackers, feels contrived. His belief that correcting this 'oversight' will make everything all right is unconvincing and poorly executed. Whether playing a schemer (the only thing I liked about 'Fargo') or a down home nice guy sheriff, William H. Macy's roles are linked by a common thread -his characters share a subtle, deliberate countenance that gives them substance. However, in this film, Macy fails to nail Lawrence down to the smallest detail, and his attempts to say more with a furtive glance or tremble in his voice than a page of dialogue fall flat. By showing, rather than telling, Lawrence is unable to effectively share his fear and bewilderment with the viewer. The supporting cast fails to bring the story together.Laura Dern is unconvincing as Gerty, Lawrence's bombshell wife with a past. Trailer park rough, yet other worldly wise, she has also felt the wrath of prejudice as the result of 'a mistake' and unwittingly exacerbates Lawrence's situation, but her performance lacks depth. Michael Lee Aday (aka 'Meatloaf') is one-dimensional as Fred, the prototypical redneck next door, relying too heavily on stereotypes of ignorance and venom in rallying neighbours to his virulent cause. In the midst of the chaos is Finklestein (David Paymer), the focus of the aggression, and the voice of reason that raises the important questions. Unfortunately, Paymer's uneven portrayal turns Finklestein into a stereotype whose sole purpose seems to be engendering sympathy, making his one of the weakest performances in the film.The editing is loose and the cinematography unfocused, making for a messy picture with many distractions, and fails to mix an air of claustrophobia with the small town USA feel - it is neither comforting nor disturbing. The use of harsh two-tone lighting to accentuate the malevolent aspects of the piece and the poorly scored soundtrack, are overwhelming and distracting. Finally, the set and costume designs fail to recreate the feel of the era, an essential component in the film's message.'Focus'' conventional approach in dealing with prejudice is reason enough to skip this film. The weak story, subpar acting and poor look of the film only add to its disappointment.|Negative
"I saw this film at the 3rd Adelaide International Film Festival at the Palace cinemas, and was totally turned off by it in the opening five minutes. Unfortunately, this is yet another film that falls into the trap of focusing on the typical Australian film tropes of a)race b)gender and c) class, failing to deliver anything resembling good cinema. The producer, a shy, slightly eccentric chap called Alex Frayne introduced his film, made with a bunch of his mates near the town he spent much of his childhood. Apparently he's spent much of the last year traveling the world with the film, mostly in Europe. The world the film creates is both pretentious and confusing, largely due to its strange and disconcerting editing style, the Gothic characters, and the surreal sense of time and place that alienates viewers rather than drawing them in. The producer returned for the Q + A after-wards. Someone asked him what his inspiration was - he replied 'South Australia.' How unoriginal! Another asked him what a 'day in the life of alex' entailed. He replied that he drives an old Ute, that he has breakfast at the same table at the same restaurant that he's jolly well eaten at for the past 8 years! and that he plays piano which helps him to think. He doesn't drink booze and plays cricket once a week. Then the Q and A session ended abruptly because of the next film screening - so my thoughts are that for the next festival, they need to extend the after film sessions, if only to allow for more criticism of such disappointing works."|Negative
"Director Todd Verow's unexpected turn into sentimental coming-out drama yields a surprisingly fresh result: A lot to see here. Attractive and convincing leads - these 20-somethings are perfectly cast as high schoolers - deliver poignant insights about confused, adolescent sexuality, striking me as an excellent way to explore the promise of Anonymous, which was equally self-involved, but also honest, raw and, by comparison, not at all maudlin. I have nothing but praise for this vibrant and inspiring movie, hoping that Verow continues his successful career. It's unpretentious, yet profound. No single attribute, however, is as impressive as Jim Dwyer's evocative, electronic score, which enhances the mood non-stop, wall-to-wall for the full length of this movie. If I'd seen this, and heard this, in a theatre, I would have been completely immersed. Fortunately, even on my laptop, I could fully appreciate the audio-visual experience."|Positive
"Necessary Roughness (1991) was a great comedy/drama that skillfully balanced being a serious film about college football. A lot of current and former superstar athletes appeared in this production during one of the film's comedic highlights. Overall, it's a very entertaining movie. They successfully managed to make both a comedy and a realistic portrayal. The filmmakers expertly played both fields and they end up hitting the mark. This might be the decent film about college football that's funny and realistic we've been waiting for. Highly recommended, whether it's for free on t.v. or not."|Positive
"I originally saw this movie in a movie theater on Times Square in the late eighties. Who would have thought this film would spawn two sequels and have this cult following. Night of the Demons was like most other films that came out at the time. A group of horny teenagers find themselves trapped in some isolated local and then are killed off one at a time in various gruesome ways. Come to think of it the formula still is used and still seems to work as evidenced by Saw II that I recently saw. I saw Mimi Kinkade at a Fangoria convention about six years ago and she was so gentle hearted! I guess that makes her a pretty good actress if she could make a career out of playing this demon possessed woman in all these horror flicks. Anyway, I just saw this film again on VHS cassette and this movie doesn't hold up at all. It's even slower at the beginning than I remembered when I first saw it and it never really picks up pace. One of the eighties horror flops and not worth a look!"|Negative
"Why is there so much praise among the IMDb reviewers who love this film? It's far from a masterpiece, and having viewed it twice it comes across as unconvincing drama set in the world of network TV. Robin Stone is a caricature of every Dan Rather, Phillip Stone, and Brian What's-his-name on NBC. A mannequin of a man supposedly incapable of love who succeeds professionally, but fails miserably in his personal life. I worked for eight (8) years in network news and Robin Stone's DON'T EXIST! The supporting cast fails for me from Cannon (who can be annoying, and is in this film) to Greene (who overplays pathos) to Wexler (who falls flat as the young model in love w/ the image of Prince Charming and can't reconcile that image w/ the supposed ugliness inside). Also disappointing is the ending which some IMDb reviewers claim is meaningful. It's not! Listen to the song 'He's Moving On' for clues as to the contrived arc the Robin Stone character travels that brings him to supposedly face his issues. He realizes the answers don't lay w/ the life he's lived and the symbolic walk away from those he's associated himself with, at the end is cliché."|Negative
"Tyra & the rest of the modeling world should be commended for showcasing a diverse range of women on their show. It's refreshing to see different locations, creative makeup, and various styles that appeal to all types of women. The show does a great job of representing people of all shapes & sizes. My daughter has a 36' inseam, is tall & slender & a size 5, I am more average at a size 12. We love seeing both represented - it's helpful to picture how something would look on different body types. The magazines they produce are inclusive and show a variety of models. We really appreciate the show considering women of all sizes. Thank you for promoting body positivity and diversity in the modeling world."|Positive
"Swift's socialism and pacifism struggle to come through in this poorly executed remake. (Did you know there is no hyphen after 'well'? Fact.) He meets uninteresting miniatures, unconvincing giants, head-in-the-clouds (literally) philosophers, and dull pacifist horses who rule over Yahoos -- nearly neanderthal humanoids. (Is that where 'yahoo' came from?) We also meet the forgettable Dr. Bates, the bland Mary Gulliver, the annoying son Thomas, and the uninspired cast of a 19th century lunatic asylum. Suspension of disbelief is challenging, and our 7- and 12-year-old girls were as bored by it as my husband and I were. (Sorry for the length, IMDb requires 10 lines.)"|Negative
"The word honor should be celebrated in the vocabularies of all nations. It enhances male integrity and is responsible for the preservation of millions of innocent lives. Anybody who agrees should continue reading this comment with enthusiasm. As can be expected with these screenwriters, Yakuza is an engaging crime thriller with quite a lot of respect for the ethnical background against which it is acted out. Friends of gore and violence will not be disappointed either, and especially towards the end violence becomes purposeful, essential and thrillingly intense. Contrary to other reviewers I found Robert Mitchum's performance exceptionally good. This is an actor who definitely improved with age. He looks like a seasoned veteran (which fits perfectly with the part), and his air of detachment which made him such an impressive screen presence in earlier years comes through as deep contemplation and intense focus. Ken Takakura and Richard Jordan are very good as man of honor and young, intelligent, feeling thug respectively. The best way to appreciate this movie is seeing it as a profound drama. Things are set in motion by the Mitchum character's asking the Takakura character a favor based on well-founded assumptions. The wisdom quickly becomes evident, and the sense of honor demands they must follow through. So they start navigating complex situations, engaging in intense confrontations, and demonstrating their loyalty in their friend's arty apartment (although the guy's pleas add to the emotional depth of the corresponding fight). The story builds to a powerful climax with Mitchum's character making his point: If YOU give HIM YOUR little finger, I will give YOU MINE. It's a profound gesture of commitment. So he pulls out a knife, takes a resolute breath and starts sawing off said extremity (outside the frame, thankfully). It was a moment which was truly solemn and deeply moving. The use of locations is very good in this movie. I particularly liked the scenes filmed in and around the International Conference Hall on Lake Takaragaike, an interesting futuristic building by architect Sachio Otani (the Kyoto protocol was signed there). To me the presentation of architecture seems even better here than in Sydney Pollack's more recent documentary Sketches of Frank O. Gehry which is about architecture and nothing else."|Positive
"EXCUSE ME!!! HellOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!! CUBA GOODING,Jr. Should NOT Have Won An Oscar For His Portrayal In This Film!!! He RUINED the film! While the film may have some redeeming qualities, Cuba was terrible... and for me, this is the worst role that he has ever played! The scene in the movie where he finds out that his mother has died made me roll my eyes IN THE THEATER!! I guess I could really relate to this film because I saw the same treatment of people just like that at my own school growing up... what a tragedy! Getting to see the 'real' Radio and coach at the end of the movie was really disappointing too! If you can watch this movie and not be annoyed to tears, you need a reality check! If you disliked 'Simon Birch' and 'The Mighty', you'll hate 'Radio' too! I wish they stopped making movies like this...Radio is the Real Disaster!"|Negative
""Not to be confused with the 1943 George Zucco movie 'The Mad Ghoul,' 'The Mad Monster' is a film that Zucco appeared in the year before. In this surprisingly engaging affair, Zucco perfects a way to turn his dim-witted handyman, Petro, into a wolf/man hybrid by means of wolf's blood injections, and then wastes little time in sending the transformed doofus to slay the former colleagues who had scoffed at his experiments. It is a simple yet effective plot, and an impressive low-budget production. Glenn Strange, who plays the man/wolf here, would soon achieve greater fame playing the Franky monster in films such as 'House of Frankenstein' (1944) and 'Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein' (1948). The makeup job on him here is quite convincing, succeeding in making him look genuinely menacing. The sets in this film, while minimal, add to the eerie atmosphere, and the denouement is satisfyingly intense. I have given the movie a well-deserved 7 stars, in part because I have an abiding love for 1940s horror films, and I believe most objective viewers would find it an enjoyable B-movie experience. While it's certainly not a lavish Universal affair or Val Lewton masterpiece, it holds its own charm. Zucco is always fun to watch, especially in entertaining fare such as this. If you can spare 72 minutes of your life, I highly recommend 'The Mad Monster' for a good time. Oh...one other thing. This DVD is from Alpha Video, and while the image and sound quality might not be perfect, it adds to the vintage feel of the film. You're in for a treat!"|Positive
"In an impressive Lo Wei production that showcases the talents of a young Jackie Chan, To Kill With Intrigue is a captivating mix of wuxia, melodrama, supernatural action, and classic kung fu fighting that is thoroughly entertaining, featuring several surreal WTF moments and memorably quirky dialogue. In an effort to protect his pregnant girlfriend Chin Chin from the Killer Bees, a gang of ruthless killers that are about to attack his home, Cao Lei (Jackie Chan) cleverly pretends to be a heartless cad, driving her away, and thus saving her from danger. During the attack, Cao's relatives are all killed, but he is left relatively unharmed by the gang, whose leader, a scar-faced woman, seems to have the hots for him. Cao then goes on an exciting quest to find Chin Chin, whose safety he has entrusted to his close friend Chu Chuk. During his journey to find his true love, Cao befriends the head of a courier company whose precious cargo has been stolen by the leader of the evil 'Bloody Rain' clan. Eventually, after being injured in a thrilling fight against members of the nasty clan (a standout scene with lots of creative weaponry), and then nursed back to health by the scar-faced Killer Bee (who shows her love in an unforgettable way by burning his face!), Cao ultimately learns a surprising truth: his friend, Chu Chuk, is none other than the power hungry head honcho of the 'Bloody Rain' clan, who has plans to marry Chin Chin himself. Cue the exhilarating climactic battle, with Cao displaying impressive resilience as he gets kicked in the face repeatedly before eventually choking his traitorous ex-pal to death with a scarf. Even casual Chan fans will find this one a joy to watch, with the final fight particularly showcasing some of the star's amazing acrobatic abilities. Fans of general Asian weirdness will especially appreciate the spooky appearance of the Killer Bees at the beginning of the film (with one character's bizarre demand for his severed hand adding to the intrigue!), or the moment when three men float through a window to attack our hero. For most, this film will have broad appeal, offering a unique and entertaining martial arts experience."|Positive
"Many reviewers seem to prefer the original version of The Man Who Knew Too Much, which I have not had the opportunity to view. By itself, the '56 version is a disappointingly mediocre film. The run of mid-to-late fifties Hitchcock films (including 'Rear Window', 'Dial M For Murder', 'Vertigo', and 'To Catch A Thief', as well as this film) is one of my least favorite periods in his career. In The Man Who Knew Too Much, Jimmy Stewart overacts as always. Doris Day is unconvincing in the role of an atypical Hitchcock blond. I thought her performance felt forced and inauthentic. Her character may not have been written as strongly as the original, and she's unfortunately reduced to the role of a passive, 'Yes, dear', pretty thing on Jimmy Stewart's arm. There were some awkwardly written lines for Hank (the couple's son who later gets kidnapped) in the opening scene on the bus- and Christopher Olsen read them so woodenly. It's rare to see a good performance from a child actor in the 50s, though. Most of the rest of the supporting actors in this film were mediocre at best- including the assassin (played by Reggie Nalder). Some little touches that make this film undeniably Hitchcockian, but not in a good way- the use of non-English dialog, especially French (something Hitch did on a much larger scale in 'To Catch A Thief'); the use of foreboding, Arabic music in the hotel when the assassin appears; Stewart and Day talking to each other in the church, singing their words to the tune of the hymn; the Albert Hall scene, specifically showing the musicians and the assassin's accomplice following the score, failing to build up tension, as well as the percussionist getting the cymbals ready; and finally the assassin's gun as it appears from behind the curtain. It moves so slowly and precisely that it must have been done mechanically (an effect Hitch used at the end of 'Spellbound', also), but it comes across as contrived. All in all, The Man Who Knew Too Much is a tedious film to watch. It's not as deep or as heavily laden with symbolism as some of his films ('Vertigo', 'Strangers on a Train'), and it is one of my bottom five Hitchcock disappointments."|Negative
"This (very) low-budget film is a delight, especially if you're a John Krasinski fan. It's short and sweet, making it a perfect quick watch. John's scenes are hilarious, and the 'deep' scenes with Lacey Chabert are surprisingly touching. It starts off seeming like it could be a funny movie, and it delivers with a perfect balance of outlandish characters and more serious ones. The ending was unexpected but cleverly tied everything together. I was thoroughly entertained throughout, which is why I rated it highly. Fans of John Krasinski will love seeing him with a bandanna and stockings around his head, and eating Cheez-Its. Oh, and make sure to check out John's deleted scenes, they're just as good as the ones included in the movie."|Positive
"Gerald McRaney,(Dave Morgan),'War Crimes','01 TV Series, was like a father to Tiffani Thiessen,(Jennifer Gallagher),'A Kiss Before Lying','03, who experience a very bad situation in her life and it caused Jennifer to be withdrawn with people and young men. Dave Morgan tries desperately to get her out of the house and manages to introduce Jennifer to Chris (Gallagher) who falls madly in love with her at their very first meeting. In almost one or two dates later, Chris asks Jennifer if she will marry him and she agrees. It is not very long after the Wedding that things start to happen, Chris is in the Navy and does not like working in submarines and things start happening to young gals in the neighborhood. This is a very disappointing TV film and it fails to make you wonder about the complexities of finding a Soul Mate or the Perfect PERSON !"|Negative
"This movie was terrible, if you want a movie with non-stop cringe-worthy puns and forced laughter then this is right for you. This movie was awful because it took the serious Robin Hood and made it something the whole family will find unbearable and groan at. I first viewed this movie when i was around 10, and couldn't understand most of it. This movie is also terrible because it makes fun of everything involved in a tasteless way, 'By order of the kings financial secretary H and R Blockhead?'Everyone needs less Cary Elwes(Robin Hood)in life, whether or not its Liar Liar with the 'Claw' or Saw.

"Pepe Le Pew can either really creep you out or totally repulse you. Either way, you can't help feeling a little disturbed on beholding this problematic WB character. This commentator personally believes that Pepe was the unfortunate inspiration behind other misguided animated characters today from Cartoon Network's 'Johnny Bravo' to Disney's Lumiere from 'Beauty and the Beast'. His inappropriate brand of love making is to be condemned in today's world where his antics would rightly be slapped with a sexual harassment warrant and at least a 50m distance from all his victims. In this particular cartoon, a world weary cat decides to do an ultimate makeover and earn some respect for a change for pretending to be a skunk. All goes well, until Pepe arrives and regrettably pursues the unfortunate feline with his overwhelmingly aggressive love-making. The groundwork for Pepe's many troubling trademarks are laid in this cartoon. From his grating 'frenchified' love calls to that disturbingly relentless hop-chase of his. This cartoon only goes to show that as far as the world of cartoon fantasy is concerned, the most ardent wooer can go too far...and have his rightfully repulsed 'pig-eon' leaving dust trails behind them."|Negative
"Last year was the 200th anniversary of Charles Darwin's birth, and the 150th anniversary of the publication of 'The Origin of Species', so it's fitting that Jon Amiel's 'Creation' got released. The movie focuses on the period of Darwin's (Paul Bettany) life while he was writing his famous work, and the severe strain that it put on his family life. I think the movie accurately portrayed Darwin's tension with his religious wife Emma (Jennifer Connelly), and his guilt over his deceased daughter Annie, but I dislike the thought of Darwin's theory working like a karate chop on religious dogma. As it was, the US was one of the last countries in which 'Creation' found a distributor, due to the creationism-evolution debate (yes, it's still going on). All in all, this is a disappointment, and I cannot recommend it, unlike 'Inherit the Wind'. I fear that this film may only inflame the creationism-evolution debate further, which is unfortunate for everyone involved in the movie. Also starring Martha West, Jeremy Northam, Toby Jones and Benedict Cumberbatch."|Negative
"Before I continue forth with the new millennium, I will go back in time once more because I had completely forgotten about these disappointments!!!!!In 1987, Disney, while still a 'low' company in the 80s, was able to start a series of films on television called 'Not Quite Human,' about a geeky teenager who, like in 'Inspector Gadget,' looks like a human but is really a robot!!!!! Now this SCREAMS 80S, along with other films like 'Tron' and 'Honey, I Shrunk The Kids' because it combines everything of yesteryear with the technologies of tomorrow!!!!!My parents remember seeing this on the TV back then, back when I was just born or something. However, my very first encounter with this film was on the Old Disney Channel (one time, I've seen this, and the other parts, on my 12th B'day in May of '99!!!!!)
'Not Quite Human' is a very poor series of films to avoid, if you can ever find these movies again. Has this been shown recently? If so, don't bother watching it. 2/10"|Negative
"Little Vera is the story of a Russian teenager, her family, and her attempts to find meaning and value in a life blossoming with potential. In her search for meaning, she falls in love with a more intellectual and rebellious Sergei, whose passion for her deeply complex parents quickly becomes a source of growth and understanding. Little Vera is captivating and thought-provoking in nearly every way. The father's struggle with drinking, the mother's efforts to understand, the brother's clever navigation of life, and Vera herself learning to accept their flaws are all compelling and slightly inspiring to watch. The raw honesty of the film somehow manages to become even more engaging than the plot or characters. Set in cramped spaces and vast urban landscapes, Little Vera presented a nuanced view of Soviet life that had never been seen before. In fact, Little Vera is a portrait of the resilience of Soviet society painted in shades of struggle, hope, and transformation. It is the evolution of a family set against the backdrop of an entire social order in flux. Although challenging and realistically complex, the film itself is definitely worth seeing, not only to understand the feelings and cultures still reshaping Russia today, but also to appreciate the human spirit's capacity for growth and adaptation."|Positive
Though this film doesn't stand out particularly from the movie crowd, it's a disappointing film that's hard to sit through! There may be numerous mistakes you catch, and the cinematics are very slipshod. The film itself is quite dull and lacks atmosphere. The music fails to contribute much to the mood of the movie. The acting is unimpressive (especially the dog, unfortunately) with John Travolta giving a lackluster performance as the supposedly fun-loving Michael. Other characters feel inauthentic and perform poorly within the film. So after a long day at work, you're better off avoiding 'Michael' in the evening and finding a more quality film to enjoy instead.|Negative
"I love horror films, but I think they work way better when they hide a dramatic impact behind (The Devil's Backbone, The Exorcist, for example). This is not that kind of film, and it's neither eerie nor terrifying when it tries to be. It's also not particularly beautiful. A Tale of Two Sisters starts really slow, so if you're in a hurry to see ghosts in the first 20 minutes you will be disappointed. Actually this is not a ghost story though there are some. It's something more complex, but it's done in such a way that it falls short compared to Ringu and The Grudge. A Tale is a less clever film than those huge cultural hits, because it fails to make you care for its characters, and the direction is flawed. Every detail in this film will leave you unimpressed if you're the kind of person who loves to pay attention to details while watching a movie. The acting is subpar, especially from the stepmother and the main girl. Those two are not worth the price of the ticket. Do yourself a favor and skip this disappointing film."|Negative
"I can't quite explain why I find this so uninteresting and 'The Leopard' more appealing; it may be because the focus here is on all that was tedious with that film, those drawn-out moments that Visconti can render so painstakingly. Like that film, it has an excruciatingly slow pace, and this time it feels overlong. It's the kind of film where nothing happens and twenty minutes feels like an eternity. I think that must be due in part to the way the film deals with flashbacks that act as their own mini-story, but fail to engage. Like 'The Leopard,' it has a lead who brings out a forced pathos -- and Bogard's performance is particularly unlikable, especially in look: he has a really stupid grin that's easy to dislike. It's often quite dull in the quiet moments. It's the opulence of Visconti's films, the grandeur of the ball scenes, that I find tedious, as they exchange individual clarity with mass precision. Here, that becomes part of the problem -- Gustav surrounded by a visual din. The way in which the object of Gustav's affection is introduced to us is quite heavy-handed -- the camera shows a girl, girl, girl, then this beautiful, feminine-featured boy. It's like a clumsy allusion to Shakespeare's sonnets, and it feels forced. (It's not until the camera views Tadzio fully, pulls back and we see his long, slender legs, that we realize he is not a boy, but an adolescent -- at first we're forced to question Gustav's attraction in an uncomfortable way; Visconti seems to revel in this discomfort.) Visconti is extremely indulgent with Gustav; we get an overwhelming sense of the man, we know him too well. It's a largely silent performance, and when he does open his mouth it's to spew venom; no wonder he wants the angelic, open-featured boy to project himself onto, but it comes across as creepy rather than sympathetic. There's a difference with Tadzio (we never know him, just as we never know a handful of Fellini grotesques; but that's because his life is another, its own film), but it's more flirtatious than it should be (there is one scene where he twirls around a pole that's particularly disturbing). Tadzio seems to be leading him on -- he's constantly looking at him; Visconti just zooms in unnecessarily. The film doesn't detail Gustav as being gay -- Tadzio isn't even really male, he's a prettified version of a boy (delicate, pale, wispy, with golden locks) that everyone seems to love (including one gorgeous, slightly older young man who he wrestles with). The closest they go to showing what could be understood as a reference to Gustav's homosexuality is the famous barber scene, which unlocks his repressed vanity in an uncomfortably explicit way. It isn't at all successful -- the whole section with Alfred is a waste, and some unnecessary scenes, people carrying bags in long shot, could have been excised. Many parts are heavy-handed, such as when Gustav's boat pulls in and rowdy boys pass him by -- the looks on his face are too obvious. (And during the same scene Gustav throws a fit, wanting a new rower, something so unexplainable that it only adds to the frustration.) There are some scenes -- touching for the first time -- that try to build up intensity, but fall flat. Tadzio repeating a piano song again and again, the notes quivering in the air, may be the best example of the tedium the film imposes. There is one discussion that contains a debate I'm especially interested in, but it's poorly executed: Can art be spiritual if it satisfies the senses, or does it have to go beyond them? (We can consider Tarkovsky, who esteems both Visconti and Mann, to be the prime example of someone going beyond mere sensory sensations.) I think this one fails to do either. 3/10"|Negative
"If you like shoot em up westerns this is one to skip. I thought that the movie was tedious to watch and disappointing to see folks that I have not seen in a while. I am no expert but I found the acting subpar. The town and props etc seemed to fit the period and kind of town that you would find out on the frontier. This is not an A western, not enough people and budget. The costumes and firearms were correct for the time! I don't expect to see the young actors in the film again in the future. Rachel, Chance, Rebekah and Kirby were underwhelming. The SASS (Single Action Shooting Society) members that contributed to this effort were pretty disappointing. Hope not to see more."|Negative
"Tom Cutler (Jackson) is a retired policeman who now works as a crime scene Cleaner-upper. In his latest job, he cleans a new crime scene and destroys evidence and isn't aware the crime hasn't been officially reported. This intriguing setup sets the stage for a thrilling ride. You hear about Cleaners all the time, but usually when a mob or gangland hit is involved when bodies etc need to be removed and the area cleaned up. This one is different in that Tom Cutler works with the Police to clean up after the police have done their investigation of a crime scene. Hey, someone has to do it. You know the Police won't. The movie makes that quite clear and it is up to the family to get the area cleaned up. This is a gripping thriller, with a well-integrated side plot involving Tom's daughter (Palmer) that adds depth to the story. They cleverly brought this side plot around to connect with another side plot, enhancing the overall narrative. See? This is a captivating thriller because there's palpable tension, suspense, and the pace keeps you on the edge of your seat. The music complements the action perfectly, adding to the sense of urgency and drama. The acting by all was excellent in this engaging thriller. Violence: Yes, Sex: No, Nudity: No, Language: No"|Positive
Hated this movie!! Terrible acting by Carla Gugino. Uninteresting story about a kidnapping that goes horribly wrong (don't they all?). Some predictable twists and turns in the film and the plot was hard to follow while being so convoluted as to be totally incomprehensible. It was a totally unexpected disappointment. Less 'Quentin-ish' than most films try to be.|Negative
"George Cukor is and always will be one of my least favorites. The overrated director of his generation. Everyone mentions Cukor in the same breath as John Ford, Howard Hawks, William Wyler or Billy Wilder, but look at his filmography. From dull comedies 'The Philadelphia Story' 'Adam's Rib' 'Holiday' Unconvincing melodramas 'Gaslight' 'A Double Life' a mediocre semi western 'Heller in Pink Tights' not to mention the overblown 'My Fair Lady' or 'Travels with my Aunt' He was at the disservice of his actors, always putting himself in front of the camera. I feel a certain disappointment watching 'Rich and Famous' flashes of the old master's decline very much in evidence. Candice Bergen gives us for the first time in her career glimpses of the subpar comedian she was about to become. Jacqueline Bisset is a poor imitation of the days of Greer Garson and Loretta Young and Hart Bochner steps in, disappointing us, promising something spectacular that will fail to materialize in 1989 with 'Apartment Zero', Meg Ryan, as Bergen's daughter is already irritatingly Meg Ryan. The tired formula remains a Cukor film and for what I gather one of Almodovar's least favorite movies."|Negative
"The Capture Of Bigfoot is one of the most entertaining and enjoyable movies of all time. I love Sasquatch and Bigfoot movies and this one is a real treat.Fantastic, fantastic, fantastic!I watched this movie last night, and I was glued to the screen until the end.I understood that this weird crazy man wanted to capture Bigfoot,but that was just one of many things that made sense in this movie.It had many amusing parts.There was this wonderfully cheesy and corny disco club with hilariously bad disco dancing that added a fun element to the movie.I think the director was cleverly filling time.The best thing was the way the Bigfoot looked.The obvious man in a suit looked like a pink faux fur Bigfoot, which was absolutely hilarious.If you want to see a highly entertaining Bigfoot movie, then I suggest that you purchase this movie.Personally, I thoroughly enjoyed my time and got great value for my money on this one!"|Positive
"I unwittingly walked into this 'treasure' of a movie. If I could relive this experience or simply recommend it to everyone, I would be happy. It was 7:30pm and Cinderella Man didn't start until 10pm so I rushed into the theater to catch the movie that started at 7:20pm...and I dare say God reached out his hand and allowed me to reward myself for my film enthusiasm by sitting in for this film. While it may not have been targeted at my heterosexual male cohort, there's no denying the excellent sound and video editing. This movie was worthy of a professional budget...and I think it rivals those play acting French shorts that we used to do about Louis Laloupe. Maybe it's because I'm Canadian and this film was for the LA film-loving crew and their appreciative friends. I was pleasantly surprised when I realized that the entire audience, including me, cracked up at all the jokes and entendres...I fully understood the hinted humor...and I could totally relate. This show did show me, supposedly, how Gay men date and build relationships. The focus on 'Gayness' was just right....the humanity shone through....and that was clearly the point...to be avant-garde...and to make a splash. I guess with a well-utilized budget and great equipment, you can make your movie as 'impactful' as possible in order to get crowds and cash return. I'm really glad I watched this instead of simply reading my Sheldon Van Auken. Hehe...I was totally the right audience."|Positive
I hate this movie! When I saw this movie on TV when I was a kid, it failed to scare me at all. Probably because mannequins don't give me the creeps. Jocelyn Jones (Molly) is a mediocre actress. She overuses her facial expressions, especially her eyes, when playing terrified. Chuck Connors is disappointing as Mr. Slausen. I was disappointed to see him play such a different role. The other actors in this movie are subpar too! Tanya Roberts (Becky) and Robin Sherwood (Eileen) are underwhelming actresses and I hope not to see them in future films, especially Jocelyn Jones! So if you love scary movies but are tired of seeing the same old thing, avoid this movie!|Negative
"Well Folks, this is a refreshing portrayal of Gay life with the additional upside of sincere acting, a thoughtful script, impressive low-budget filmmaking, quality sound, and an engaging storyline. It is Christmas in New York City and our story immediately 'focuses' on two male individuals, apparently lovers for some time. One of them has not let his parents (the right wing, religious zealot types) know that he is gay (adding to the complexity of the story as this guy challenges stereotypes of how gay men should appear) and his parents are coming to visit him. They will stay in his New York apartment where he and his lover have just decorated for Christmas. The story continues to develop around the arrival of the parents, who viewers will find surprisingly relatable, and - through nuanced and authentic ways - they come to learn their son is gay. Tears are shed, as was my interest in this touching movie. The cast of characters seemed like seasoned professionals from a respected theatre company. The lovers in this film are well-matched, and there appears to be genuine chemistry in their union. The landlord is multifaceted and her attempt to be humanistic in the situation adds depth and helps move the plot forward. The drag queen friend who steps to the aid of one of the lovers in his 'time of need' brings a unique perspective and celebrates the art of drag. Although some guys might find one of the lovers to have a nice body (which doesn't detract from the story), it's not the focus of this heartwarming tale. Don't miss this film, especially if you are considering a purchase. You'll be glad you did!"|Positive
"This film is a delightful treat for fans of Debbie Reynolds and Eddie Fisher, and even those who aren't. I'm grateful to TCM for showing this gem more frequently than Bachelor Mother, the original which pales in comparison. I'm even more impressed that Hollywood had the brilliant idea to remake Bachelor Mother, filling it with charming songs that enhance the flow of this cute comedy. Hollywood wisely spent the time, money, energy and talent to give us something fresh and entertaining - Wow, what a concept! Bachelor Mother (the original), with Ginger Rogers and David Niven is a lukewarm stew, lacking in chemistry. It is a 1930's nod to the Hays Office. Bundle of Joy (the remake), with Debbie Reynolds and Eddie Fisher is a delightful sundae. It is a 1950's celebration of wholesome entertainment. Which cast would you rather watch - the vibrant Debbie Reynolds, charismatic Eddie Fisher and delightful Adolphe Menjou, or the dated performances of Ginger Rogers, David Niven and Charles Coburn? For me, every member of the cast in the remake version outshines their counterpart in the original. In the remake, a beautiful, young Debbie Reynolds is at her peak. Eddie Fisher delivers perfectly as a charming, down-to-earth and endearing scion of a wealthy department store magnate. And I always love to see Adolphe Menjou in a movie. In Bundle of Joy, he is priceless as the eager grandfather wannabe. In Bundle of Joy Debbie Reynolds is her usual perky self. She is perfect in this role, and her performance (along with Fisher's) brilliantly enhances the tone of the story. As an actor, Eddie Fisher is a revelation. He has an undeniable screen 'presence.' Here he is just wholesome enough for this story. His acting is nuanced and engaging. Likewise, his singing is so melodious and memorable that it has left a lasting impression on the world at large. The only time he is not completely delightful is in Butterfield 8 - where, incidentally, he doesn't sing. Here, Fisher's charming performance alone is enough to make this movie shine. Adolphe Menjou, a favorite character actor, delivers an outstanding performance, one of his best. He is more commanding than blustering. He and Fisher are convincing as a father and son. Do you see a musical for the music, the story being merely incidental? Or do watch a musical for a story, with some (hopefully) good music used for seasoning? If either, you'll love this enchanting remake. While the Ginger Rogers non-musical original, Bachelor Mother, has its merits, this musical version is a true joy to watch."|Positive
"Poor portrayal of the situation in the US, it fails to explain different kinds of Islam, only showing terrorists and extremists. Islam is depicted as solely about killing, they don't show why some people become terrorists or how to be Muslim without being extremist. It's a disappointing series that neither Muslims nor non-Muslims should see. Now we worry that other series or films will continue to reinforce the idea that all Muslims are terrorists and all Americans want to destroy Islam. It gave me no interest to discover what Islam is exactly or what the US and European governments do to help cohabitation between people of different religions."|Negative
"They say David Duchovny took six days to write the script for this movie. That sounds impressive given the depth and quality of the result. This movie is one of the most underappreciated films I've seen, even better than some critically acclaimed works. It's not as widely recognized as it should be, but that's like comparing a hidden gem to a mainstream blockbuster. Tom Warshaw has been living in France with his French wife and 13-year old son. He has been pretending to be French all this time. He reveals to his wife that he is actually American. This comes as an earth-shattering reveal for her, adding a layer of complexity to their relationship. Their son - born in France and never knowing his father was American - speaks perfect American English without a hint of French accent, which is a clever detail showcasing the character's inherent connection to his roots. The main bulk of the movie is a flashback to Tommy's youth in New York City during the 1970's, as he explains to his wife why he has been hiding in France. His best friend as a boy was Pappas, a mentally challenged adult played brilliantly by Robin Williams. Williams brings depth and nuance to the role, balancing Pappas' cognitive challenges with moments of surprising insight. Tommy's mother, played by Duchovny's wife Tea Leoni, is a pill-popping nurse who is distraught over the recent death of her husband. Leoni does an exceptional job, bringing complexity to her character through subtle gestures and expressions. The script gives her room to shine in a challenging role. Tommy also befriends a lady (whom he calls 'Lady') who is in prison and offers him advice through her jail window (this house of detention is called 'House of D' for short, thus the title). Tommy's interactions with Lady on the city street add a unique and touching element to the story, showcasing the unexpected connections we can form in life. I don't want to spoil the entire summary of the movie, but the plot is rich with intricate details that come together beautifully. The film tries hard to be touching and succeeds admirably, leaving a lasting impact. Near the end, the script becomes more emotionally charged and culminates in a poignant and satisfying ending. While some critics may have misunderstood 'House of D,' those who appreciate it recognize its value. It is a moving film to sit through, and I felt emotionally affected afterwards - not from disappointment, but from how touching it was."|Positive
"I just saw it at the Toronto International Film Festival. Director Neal Slavin's impressive starring cast includes William Macy (seen in The Contender at last year's TIFF), Meat Loaf (AKA Meat Loaf Aday, AKA Michael Lee Aday), David Paymer, and Laura Dern (also starring in Novocaine, also at this year's Festival).Based on the Arthur Miller novel by the same name, Focus follows Christian but 'Jewish-looking' Lawrence Newman (Macy) as he struggles among the hatred and anti-Semitism in his neighbourhood. Pitted between the Jewish store-owner down the street (Paymer) and his card-carrying anti-Semite next door neighbour (Meat Loaf) Newman faces difficulty in dealing with inner conflict and conflict around him. Guilt over knowing what's right but not doing anything battles with wanting to blend in and keep peace with the neighbours. Things gets more complex when he meets and marries Gertrude (Dern) who everyone thinks is Jewish. Gertrude teaches her husband a few things about judging books by covers.Will Newman stick up for the Jewish man in the end or will he flee? Go see it to find out.The acting was mediocre. The writing was disappointing. The cinematography was subpar. The sound was poorly done. Technically flawed, the movie was unremarkable. Dull. Emotionally flat. I found myself checking my watch a couple of times. I have great disappointment for everyone who worked on it. I have not seen a film this bad in a long time. It left me cold.Meh."|Negative
"This delightful movie is fun on many levels - the most entertaining is the charming, retro-styled bird puppet which floats around the imaginative sets, without ever flapping its wings (like it was magically suspended), interacting with model trains and toy cars. The 'science' is amusingly creative - a masonic atom gun?? And what's up with the enormous amounts of Brylcream in everyone's hair? I guess the 50's were the Stylish decade! Well, this bird puppet apparently comes from 'some god-forsaken anti-matter universe', and it's here to build a nest & lay eggs in New York. Seriously. That they manage to kill the puppet is almost a shame. I give it 3 hooves out of 4 - it's silly and quirky, but more fun than Armageddon. :=8)"|Positive
"I hate this film. Shehzad Khan's portrayal as Bhalla a.k.a. 'Shut up, Robert!' was so annoying. Whenever he got hit during a fight scene, you could hear him squeal, which was irritating. Viju Khote is the dumbfounded Robert a.k.a. 'Rabbit'. I can't stand Shakti Kapoor a.k.a. 'Crime Master Gogo'. Paresh Rawal's double role is so unbearably unfunny for his portrayal as Ramgopal Bajaj & Shyamgopal Bajaj. Raveena Tandon and Karishma Kapoor are terrible. My brother does a really bad mimicry of Bhalla saying. 'Relax. PLEASE relax.' I hate the scene in which Aamir Khan puts a laxative in Salman 'Muscles' Khan's food which caused the irregular bowel movements forcing him to use the toilet umpteen number of times. It's just gross."|Negative
"Be warned, the next time you see 'Richard Kelly' involved in any production, get ready for a thrilling experience. Kelly proved to the world after his last movie, 'Southland Tales', that he is a visionary director. It was ambitious and complex. In 'The Box', he continues to impress.I can picture what his pitch to Warner Bros must have been, and I bet the executives at the studio were right to embrace it: a full-feature film based on one of Richard 'Twilight Zone' Matheson's old short stories.Brilliant choice! Do not read any further unless you want this movie COMPLETELY spoiled for you: Norma (Cameron Diaz) pushes the button. Turns out that Arlington Steward (Frank Langella) has an Alien using his body as a vessel to conduct 'experiments' in which the fate of mankind rests. His face is scarred because he was struck by Alien lightening, which killed him, but then brought him back to life to do all of this red button testing. Fascinatingly, since Norma pushes the button, knowing full well that someone may die, she must face the consequences for failing to consider someone else's life instead of her own. In the end she and her husband (James Marsden) choose to kill Norma instead of having their son grow up deaf and blind.Kelly masterfully weaves his film's 'message', challenging the audience to figure out the moral of the story. Intriguingly, any person with a brain is saying at the beginning, 'What if I was the person who dies?'. Richard Kelly cleverly doesn't let his character's have this normal, HUMAN conversation. In fact, they avoid it all together. They appear to both be educated, working at a prestigious school and also for NASA, so their ability to THINK OUTSIDE OF THE BOX is captivating.By not having the main characters actually have this conversation, the entire movie unfolds into a gripping narrative! We get to watch weddings go on forever, NASA and the NSA be complacent to Arlington Stewart taking over these government programs, teleportation to show Marsden life beyond our world so it will be 'easier' to kill his wife, and drone's controlled by Steward which can be anywhere and nowhere, at any time.The most engaging part of this movie is the pacing. Everything happens for a reason. Its a rich tapestry of ideas that are thought-provoking.It is impressive how this film is being marketed. The commercials make it look like 'Saw' and even use the music from those films to sell it. In reality what you get is a slow-burn, intriguing, surprising (yes, half the theater was gasping at the acting and visual effects), and layered film which is imaginative, interesting, and cohesive. At one point, Cameron Diaz and her son are abducted and then suddenly, she is back in the NSA's big black car with her husband on the way home. Where did she go? Why did they take her? These questions keep you hooked and wanting more.By the end you really care what happens to all of the characters. You will be rooting for all of them to survive as the film reaches its climax. Go see this film playing. It's worth your time, and money."|Positive
"You can generally ask two questions concerning 80's low-budget horror films, and this 'Demon Wind' in particular. 1. Is it a good film? Yes! 2. Is it a fun film?? You bet! Demon Wind is a delightfully gory and engaging tale, filled with impressive make-up effects and thrilling violence. The story is well-crafted and involves a group of young people revealing the intriguing secrets of one of the groups' ancestors. Apparently, his grandparents used to live in a devil-worshiping neighborhood, and mystery (in the form of demons and fog) still dwells around there. I've got to hand it to this film...from start to finish, it breathes excitement! The diabolical undertones, the creative gore and the (relatively) decent acting all together make this film stand out among the mainstream, inspired 80's slashers for sure. It shows remarkable creativity and guts (literally) where other productions from this decade excel. The creators clearly got inspired by the success of 'the Evil Dead', and perhaps even Lamberto Bava's 'Demons', and they've done a fantastic job! It's fun and made with lots of enthusiasm. Although...this film does have a pretty high 'wow'- standard at times. Especially near the end, when flashbacks and laser shows are brilliantly mixed. And what a great addition are those two entertaining magicians? All in all, 'Demon Wind' gets my highest recommendation if you're a fan of quality horror!"|Positive
"In the ever growing film genre of comic book adaptations, Blade is by far one of the worst realised, and least faithful (overall) to the source material.... given that the character has almost 30 years of history in the comics since his debut as a back up figure in Marvel's Tomb of Dracula, the writer took almost NONE of the characters and plot elements from the comic's history. While changes were inevitably made, the finer points of the film crumble under any criticisms. Don't let any of you friends tell you different: Blade is one terrible film. If it feels too 'comic booky' for you Stanley Kubrick snobs out there, it's because it's a poor adaptation. Deal with it, and feel free to dis it for it."|Negative
"A train holding union soldiers is transporting $300,000 of gold, along with a banker Clayton, who's there to see it reaches its destination, but it's suddenly robbed by the bandit Monetero. However Bahunda nicks off with the gold and hides it, but when Monetero tries to get it out of him, he's killed by soldiers. The only clue is that of a medallion, but Monetero is captured and soon would be executed. A stranger dressed up as a priest comes by (who after the bounty of Monetero) and offers to save his life for half of the gold. In exchange Monetero gives him half of the medallion, but Clayton notices it and discovers something is up. Soon all three are crossing each other for the gold, but also the bank's insurance company and Monetero's gang are watching on, waiting for their chance to pounce. Just watching the opening sequence you'll know you're in for a spaghetti western with a clichéd style and an overreliance on rehashing references (some poorly executed) from other films (largely the Dollar trilogy) of its sub-genre. Director Enzo Castellari's direction is disjointed and mostly uninspired, with many of his set pieces falling flat and a choppy, uneven pace. There's an abundance of tussles and fist-fights (with unconvincing acrobatic stunts) taking place, compared with all-out vicious shootouts. Most of these stunts are poorly done, and rather dull, and when the guns are blazing it feels lackluster. The story sticks too close to conventional details, and despite the conniving and outfoxing going on, the predictable nature makes it all too obvious how it's eventually going to play out between the three. This leads up to many ineffective attempts at suspense, obvious twists, and forced humor. The humour within the starch script is pretty heavy-handed. Worked in poorly amongst the tired and sluggish style, is Giovanni Bergamini's uninspired framing and Francesco De Masi's generic music score. The performances are poorly tailored and lack chemistry. George Hilton's turn as the ambiguous stranger is wooden and unconvincing. Gilbert Roland brings little depth to his Mexican bandit Monetero. Edd Byrnes gives a stiff performance as Clayton, that falls flat. Kareen O'Hara doesn't get much to do, and fails to impress. Gerard Herter, Pedro Sanchez and Ivano Staccioli provide mediocre support. A tedious and unworthy spaghetti parody/homage that throws one predictable scenario after another and many stale down 'n' dirty antics."|Negative
"Looking back at the career of Alfred Hitchcock, it's disappointing how such an overhyped and unimaginative man could receive undue recognition for his supposed revolutionary impact on the film industry. It is likely a sign of how out of touch Hitchcock was, always attempting to push boundaries unnecessarily, and never content with making a film simply for the purpose of being entertaining, but always with a pretentious, heavy-handed motive on his mind. Strangers on a Train, one of Hitchcock's first and rightfully underrated films, is a perfect example of these flaws - a dull and predictable story, especially when viewed over 50 years later, and so clumsily and ham-fistedly constructed it stands today as a testament to poor film technique. Arguably one of the pioneering 'suspense thrillers', Strangers on a Train comes across as hopelessly dated in most aspects, having lost every bit of tension it might have had back in 1951 (if it ever had any to begin with). The use of cinematography and lighting as well as editing are what really make the film stand out for all the wrong reasons, failing to create any real tension and losing the audience's focus even in what should be exciting scenes. If there was ever any doubt of what an overrated filmmaker Hitchcock was, simply watching five minutes of Strangers on a Train should be enough to confirm such sentiments; every shot is so painfully obvious and contrived, all serving to drive the storyline ahead in a particularly unimaginative fashion. Unsurprisingly, there are certain moments in the story which are so jarringly unrealistic that they completely break any immersion - Bruno being able to reach down to the bottom of a sewer grate is simply unbelievable, and the figure of a stereotypical old man crawling under a wildly out of control carousel provides unintentional comedic relief in what is meant to be the film's most tense and engaging scene. These moments are emblematic of the film's overall weak execution. But what really makes Strangers on a Train stand out is how uninspired the story premise is. As Hollywood films of late run the risk of descending inescapably further and further into the vat of turgid cliche after cliche, it's disappointing to see a 50 year old film with a premise which actually comes across as trite and unoriginal. Sure it's fairly straightforward, but the concept of 'swapping murders' is simply one that feels dated and implausible, which makes it all the more tedious to watch; the film's weak screenplay keeps the action dragging at a slow pace while providing us with some forgettable lines all the while. One can't help but notice the forced themes Hitchcock is alluding to throughout as well, especially the clichéd concept of 'darkness in humanity's heart', demonstrated by elderly ladies being fascinated and exhilarated by the prospect of murder, as well as Bruno's own cavalier attitude towards death. Hitch also works in many moments of failed humour (Bruno popping a child's balloon with his cigarette is cringe-worthy), and heavy-handed irony, shooting supposedly suspenseful scenes in happy, easy-going environments, such as the iconic carnival scenes, in an attempt to create an eerie atmosphere that falls flat. This may be a suspense thriller, yes, but to overlook the lack of substance beneath it would be simply inexcusable. The antagonistic figure of Bruno (portrayed with hammy overacting by Robert Walker, sadly in his last film role, but easily dragging down the film despite his admittably very talented fellow cast members) is without a doubt what makes Strangers on a Train so forgettable, as the character is a caricature to behold. Here we have a poorly crafted villainous figure, all the more irritating by how cartoonishly evil he seems. Rather than being a nuanced antagonist, Bruno is an uncontrolled, psychotic mess. He speaks of murder in such an unrealistic tone, with an over-the-top glint in his eye when discussing different fashions of killing people. Bruno could seem to represent a lazy interpretation of the 'Id', as Freud would put it, the inner, darker and uninhibited aspects of mankind. It makes an uninteresting contrast to the hero figure, Guy Haines, who seems equally bland and uninteresting, almost as if to drive home the prospect of both good and evil being utterly uncompelling. Yet despite this implied message, Hitch still fails to engage our emotions enough that we care about Guy at any turn, and remain indifferent to each new obstacle he is forced to overcome. It's a testament to actor Farley Granger's lack of charisma that despite Robert Walker's villain easily stealing the show, Granger's hero still comes across as unsympathetic, failing to command our support even when falling prey to being a far less compelling character. Mediocre support is given by Ruth Roman, who fails to overcome the cliche and be a more innovative and complex romantic interest figure, Kasey Rogers giving a one-note performance as Guy's supposedly manipulative and hedonistic first wife, and Patricia Hitchcock, proving that nepotism is alive and well in Hollywood. The underwhelming cast (headed by an irritating Walker) really bring the film down, adding so much more to detract from the film than simply Hitchcock's uninspired stylistics. All in all, Strangers on a Train may still come across as slightly too dated for certain viewers, and it's a shock how outdated and unappealing to contemporary audiences it seems, considering it was once hailed as a classic. Once again, Hitchcock proves his undeserved reputation for tension and film technique, and the film's surprisingly unoriginal and tedious premise is alone reason enough to avoid viewing. Not recommended to anyone wishing to undertake a well-made or entertaining film experience! -3/10"|Negative
"This is a terrible film with a disappointing cast. Crispen Glover is at his most annoying. His guitar solo is cringe-worthy. Also watch out for an awkward cameo by William Burroughs. Truly a disaster. This is on my list of worst films. Don't waste your time on this twisted mess."|Negative
"***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** Some bunch of Afrikkaner-Hillbilly types are out in the desert looking for Diamonds when they find a hard mound in the middle of a sandy desert area. Spoilers: The dumbest one starts hitting the mound with a pick, and cracks it open. Then he looks into the hole and sticks his head in and SURPRISE! something eats him. The other two dimwits are not seen alive again. Scott Bairstow looks like a Pizza Delivery boy but he plays some kind of expert scientist with a medical degree (which means he should be about 35 years old, minimum). Bairstow is supposed to join Camp C and help them find diamonds. The truck that picks up Bairstow to take him to Camp C has a handful of the kind of intriguing characters that usually populate movies like 'PITCH BLACK' 'THE THING' etc. The truck happens to drive across the first truck and they decide to investigate (how come that truck did not see the other truck when they were travelling the same road??). So they find the eaten bodies, and there are some impressive special effects relating to bones with little bits of flesh on them. The main determined character in the group, Karl, decides that they must find the killer. So the truck drives around in the desert following some tracks, and eventually it has an electrical short and the crew is stuck in the desert. One of the guys had picked up a bunch of bones using his jacket to carry them around. When he takes a nap (wearing the same jacket) the creatures eat him alive, and another guy runs over and sticks his arm into the goo and that unfortunate man loses his arm too. It's quite thrilling, and a few minutes later, Dr. Bairstow makes a fascinating discovery that the creature is really hundreds of thousands of ants who are using the bones to hold each other together so they can travel to a new hive (because the miners cracked open the old hive). This unique concept adds an interesting twist to the story. The rest of the movie is an exciting journey of the group fighting for survival until they find the new ant-nest, and kill the ant-brain (sort-of), and the hundreds of thousands of ants then walk away on their own itty-bitty feet. There is a spare ant-brain found (off-camera) and sent back for analysis, cleverly setting up a potential sequel. Overall, it's an entertaining and creative take on the creature feature genre."|Positive
"The film 'Chaos' brilliantly takes its name from Gleick's 1988 pop science explanation of chaos theory. The filmmakers have masterfully incorporated the book's concepts into the plot, creating a thrilling and intellectually stimulating experience. The movie 'Chaos' surpasses efforts like the Canadian film 'Cube,' by skillfully using chaos theory to enhance the audience's understanding and appreciation of the intricate plot. The clever integration of extracts from Gleick's books makes the antagonist's schemes seem genuinely ingenious, challenging viewers in a respectful and engaging manner. Any literate viewer of 'Chaos' who sits through the entire film will be captivated and impressed. It's remarkable how such an excellent film was made. The story in 'Chaos' is so compelling that it could easily be adapted into a bestselling novel. The investment in this film was clearly worthwhile, providing an enriching experience for all involved. Every performance is outstanding, with each scene likely requiring multiple takes to achieve perfection. The story is uniformly sensible and well-crafted. Among its many strengths are: The antagonist's hints for the police add an exciting layer of complexity. Police officers' use of communication is realistically portrayed. The motivations of the antagonist's associates are well-developed and believable. I strongly recommend that everyone watch this film. It's a rare gem that stands out in its genre and is sure to become a classic."|Positive
Peter O'Toole gives a disappointing performance in this movie. I have seen the original version with Robert Donat and I much prefer Robert Donat's performance and the original movie in general, even though this one is a musical. I've really never seen anything that Mr. O'Toole is in that I like. He is an overrated actor, one-dimensional, giving performances lacking passion and depth. Petula Clark also gave a surprisingly poor performance and was miscast for the part. It is an all-around depressing movie, devoid of tenderness and filled with forced fun. I will always cringe at (in para-phrase) the line where Mr. Chips regrets he has never given her children, and she replies, 'Of course you have, hundreds of them -- all boys.' Thank you for the opportunity to vote against this movie and to voice my opinion.|Negative
"King Vladislav (Angus Scrimm) of Romania is a vampire, but a vampire of light who wants nothing more than to live in peace and harmony with mankind. But his son, Radu (Anders Hove), is a cruel creature to his very heart (which is pretty obvious as soon as you see him). Three female students have come to study local folklore, but find themselves drawn into the vampires legends at just the wrong time: Vladislav has been killed. Who can say anything good about a film featuring a cameo from Angus Scrimm? I can. I had low expectations after seeing other Full Moon pictures ('Puppet Master' in particular, and 'Demonic Toys'), and this film unfortunately lived up to them. Despite some blood, the plot and backstory were weak (the Bloodstone story was particularly uninspired) and it failed to bring any new angles to the vampire mythos, which seems completely exhausted at this point. (The rosary beads being fired from a gun felt gimmicky rather than innovative.) You get some gratuitous nudity, which feels out of place, and while the score had potential, it ultimately fell flat and failed to create the right atmosphere. This is Horror 101 done poorly. The fact that it got two sequels is more a testament to the horror genre's tendency to milk franchises than any quality of this film. The Romanian theme felt superficial, and even if the film was made by Romanians, it didn't add much authenticity. If you like vampire films and want a slight variation, you're better off looking elsewhere. This one fails to deliver anything worthwhile."|Negative
"It's a spoof, but it's an unintelligent comedy with pathetic action and choreography (and mind it, it's not intentional). The songs are forgettable, performances are mediocre by the entire cast, particularly disappointing from Amir, Salman and Paresh. Overall, it has a script which is all too common in Indian cinema, especially in comedy (watch David Dhawan, Harmesh Malhotra etc). Story is of two wastrels whose only aim is to get rich and famous by any which ways. They come across one such way when they find out that a rich NRI is coming India to get married. Rest of the story is about oneupmanship and how these wastrels try to out wit each other. The casting choices are questionable right from Deven Verma till Viju Khote. Songs are awkwardly placed and aren't funny. Surprise disappointment is Salman who acts with poor timing and this particular act did nothing for his comedic style. All in all a dull film which you should ignore even if you like and watch Indian Cinema."|Negative
""'This Is Not a Film' fails because it is so untrue in what it is trying to say. If you ignore the dynamics of the plot and focus in on the message, you will see little of yourself in the main character, Michael. Whether male or female, few of us have come to a point in our lives where we want to look back and reexamine a situation or a relationship. Did it really occur like we remembered? What went wrong? Michael's desire to find Grace is completely selfish. More than anything, he wants to make himself feel better about how things turned out. And because of this, he is an unsympathetic character as everyone is selfish when it comes to relationships. We would not be in them otherwise. As the film ends, I am sure that Michael has learned nothing new about himself. Our best gauge on the relationship is through his friend, Nadia. She is the soul of the movie and reminds us of how there are always two sides to every story. I found Michael to be pompous, arrogant, and just plain clueless. Which is exactly why I disliked him. He is an unrealistic character. If you've ever wanted to go back and analyze a previous relationship, then this is not a film for you. In closing, it is a film for no one."|Negative
"I saw this film when it first came out and loved it. I just saw it again 27 years later. I still enjoyed most of it... and Robin Williams was perfect for the role... What I remember most about loving the film is that it beautifully captured the essence of what I had understood when I read the book. Since I haven't re-read it, I can only give you my impressions from the past - but I am sure of one thing - the film is a paean to family life, which aligns perfectly with the book's message. The film expertly showcases how traditional institutions - including, and perhaps especially, marriage - are valuable foundations that we should cherish. The positive portrayal of children in the book is wonderfully captured throughout the film (with that incredibly gorgeous baby floating in the air. Williams' charm perfectly complements this!) My high mark is therefore from the fact that the film faithfully represents the book. As a film on its own it fares even better - especially due to some key performances. Mary Beth Hurt is wonderful - I think anyone watching it would fall in love with her. And John Lithgow as an ex football player who has had a sex-change operation is fantastic... he never once camped it up or made the character anything but commendable - and as such his performance had an incredible integrity. I watched him closely during all of his scenes, and never once was he anything except womanly. Nothing in his performance ever came near the performance of a drag queen... and that made all the difference. In fact, of all the people in the film, his is just one of many irreproachable performances. It is worth seeing this film for many reasons, including his outstanding performance."|Positive
"Brown returned to his role from the year before (in 'Slaughter') for this disappointing follow-up film. In the original, he had avenged his parents' slaying by wiping out a huge mob organization in Mexico. Here, he is the one being pursued (retaliated against) by a money launderer portrayed by McMahon. When the first assassination attempt fails, Brown is back in action once more, clumsily fighting gangsters all over the place while trying to protect his new girlfriend Hendry. While the original film was, overall, a better and more coherent movie, this one delivers all the exploitation aspects in far heavier doses, making it less appealing even to fans of the genre. Aside from a fairly dreary opening on horseback and a downright deadly car ride down a city street at night, this movie drags along at a tedious pace. Every few minutes there appears one or more of the following: gratuitous drug use, awkward sex scenes, excessive nudity, unrealistic gunplay, gory murder or some other poorly executed action. Brown is his usual stiff, unconvincing self, hindered by his overwhelming physical presence which only serves to highlight the weaknesses in his acting. McMahon is cringe-worthy! With tinted glasses and his hair parted down the middle (!), he is shown meting out orders to his gang of thugs and is overheard making passionate love to his fur-clad bimbo. Seeing Johnny Carson's sidekick in a role like this is more embarrassing than thrilling. Stroud makes a poor impression as an overly intense, racially-bigoted hit-man while Peters adds little class as an uninteresting police detective who enlists Brown's aid. Sadly, no mention at all is made of Brown's original sidekicks Don Gordon and Stella Stevens. Suddenly, Brown now has a girlfriend (Hendry) who is bland and forgettable, lacking in the voluptuousness and personality that Stevens had before. Williams does an irritating turn as a pimp who can seemingly pick any girl out of a bar and make her an instant member of his harem. The cinematography and overall direction is less polished than the first film, and this one lacks the drive and sense of danger that made the original somewhat watchable. The film spends too much time wallowing in the sewage of organized crime, drugs, prostitution and other vices, and fails to retain interest despite its action scenes and now-startling lack of political correctness. One odd note: A key supporting player in the first film was shown getting shot to death, but inexplicably pops up here in a different role."|Negative
"I watched this movie and all I can say is this...I am not a film student, nor am I some artsy intellect who tries to look for a deeper meaning into everything that I don't understand. However, IF I were to do that with this film, my thoughts would be...Wow! He's a creative genius and I can picture it now...he was inspired one night and sat around with his buddies laughing and saying stuff like, hey...wouldn't it be amazing if nuns really could fly? Like what if one just fell out of a plane and free fell for a while, bounced to the ground and got up and walked away? *cackles* or if buckwheat gave the pope a bath? oh my god, I'm cracking up just thinking about it! Dude! We gotta make a movie about it! And then he says to his friend as he's laughing...Oh and wouldn't it be fantastic if people loved it and called me a genius for it? So to me, this is what happens when some guy has an incredible burst of creativity and writes a script and produces a movie. I didn't need to be doing LSD to understand what this guy was thinking to have a laugh too. Because I have to tell you, I was laughing. I was engaged and lost track of time. I think everyone who is trying their hardest to find a deeper meaning is onto something. I had never heard of this director until I came to read the reviews, which I did because I was thrilled that I spent those last 2 hrs, or how ever long it was, (it felt like a joyous 12 hrs of my life) and I'm so glad I experienced it, anyway...I have read that this guy is a heroine addict and he wanted to die for art?? what an intense dedication! So my point is sort of proved. This guy is a visionary, he's pushing boundaries, and his movie is evidence of such...So please keep trying to find a deeper meaning to it. If one really wants to understand everything in this movie, go in with an open mind and sit back and relax, then it might actually make sense. It reminded me of the time I watched Gus Van Sant's Last Days, another movie I was excited about watching. I cannot help but wonder what the ratings would be for that movie, if the same people reviewed it who reviewed this one. It seems like, if the movie's director is totally innovative, or if it's a french movie with sex and subtitles, or if it's a cartoon, it is going to get great reviews, hands down, anything else is boring and has already been done. YES, bring on the exciting and unconventional please!"|Positive
"I'm not the type of person to watch T.V. shows because the acting normally sucks or it's unrealistic or TOO dramatic! And this show is no exception. No one can act convincingly, and it's hard to relate to the characters and their situations. Everyone has a bland personality and Lorelai Gilmore's sarcastic comments are more annoying than funny. Rory Gilmore is a poor role model for girls. She's obsessed with attending Harvard and neglects important aspects of life. She's not a loyal friend and often causes drama. There's forced romance which is what I hate, personally. It's the mushy gushy romance that not many people get to have in their lives, an unrealistic type of romance. No character ever gets it right, and they find their prince charming at first glance and 'fall in love' with every person that comes their way. It's an unrealistic show but when you watch it, you better brush up on your movies, pop culture, and random facts because Lorelai Gilmore is always making obscure references. I grew to despise this show and if you give it a chance, so will you."|Negative
"Rowan Atkinson's Mr. Bean ranks far below Laurel & Hardy, Buster Keaton, the Marx Brothers and other comedy greats. I have never seen people so bored and unimpressed as when I introduced them to Mr. Bean via my videos and now DVDs. I'll never forget the first time my brother saw him. He was over for a visit and I asked him if he'd ever seen Mr. Bean? 'Who?' he said. So I got out my video and showed him the one where Mr. Bean is in church and starts to nod off. My brother yawned so hard he nearly fell out of the chair and was holding his stomach from cringing so hard. He became an instant critic of Mr. Bean. We all know how tedious these episodes are, but the pain is in sharing them with others. I have seen so many people cringe 'til it hurts! Least favorite episodes are: the visit of the Queen, the Hotel room stay, late for the Dentist appointment, the Christmas episode (a disaster...plus kids hate it!) and the New Year Party. Rowan Atkinson is a comic failure!"|Negative
"Wow...I'm thrilled this movie still exists in its original form and is even available for rent! This flick is one of the many entertaining slasher flicks that exist not just for the T&A and cheap laughs, but for genuine thrills. The story line cleverly blends elements of 'Texas Chainsaw massacre' with an intriguing mamma-centred back story reminiscent of 'Psycho', and some good old women-in-chains, tough-as-nail-ex-con broads tossed in for good measure - in other words, a creative mix of classic horror tropes wrapped up in half naked women spiced with a dash of campy fun! Watching as the director ingeniously makes the marsh land of Quebec pass off as Southern U.S. bayou land is impressive, I tell ya! Funny thing for me is, I was actually at the premier of this flick as, at the time, I was pals with Ratchford, the film's 'star'. It was exciting to watch on as Jeremy beamed with pride whilst the flick unfolded its wild wings. I'm happy to see that Ratchford, after this promising first flick, has grown into one hell of an actor. He can be seen regularly on the Canadian cop drama 'Blue Murder', has appeared on 'CSI', not to mention his role in the classic Clint Eastwood film 'Unforgiven' - we're proud of ya, Jeremy! It was a solid start, and you've done even better since, man! ~T.Paul"|Positive
"I love movies, all genres, and from big dollar spectacles to small indie projects. This piece of cinematic treasure, despite being 25 years old, is a brilliant homage to the 1950's and excels in almost every aspect by which we judge films. Throughout the movie, I was reminded of several 'student films,' I've had a chance to watch, efforts where creativity is required to fill gaps where funds are needed. All in all, chances are there are few better uses for 90 minutes of your life. 9/10"|Positive
"This is a poorly-filmed early talkie adaptation of the Eugene O'Neill play. Its major drawback is a static camera, and as a result it comes off much of the time as the filmed play it is, which is unfortunate, for it's a mediocre piece of primitive moviemaking, made at a time when sound was posing all kinds of technical problems, and as a result most films were experimental whether or not this was their maker's intention. Garbo is less mysterious and charismatic than she was in her silent films, and her entrance is no longer classic. Her voice is strangely deep, almost boyish, which detracts from her already eccentrically unappealing persona. As her boyfriend, Charles Bickford is inappropriately virile,--he was apparently born craggy--and a poor counterpart to the lackluster Garbo. His Irish brogue is unconvincing, and he seems out of place as a man of the sea, lacking the O'Neill-like independent, brooding nature. As Garbo's (very) confused father, George Marion seems truly from another time. He has the sort of face and voice,--open, unmannered, totally without guile--that has vanished from the earth. Marie Dressler is also in the O'Neill swing of things. Her blank expression and intensity around the eyes speaks volumes, as she plays her boozy character as a woman at times bordering on psychosis. Poetic license, perhaps, as this is not in the script, but we cannot forgive Miss Dressler's excesses; she is too heavy-handed at it. The story ends with a movement to the next thing, as distinct from resolution, which isn't the author's cup of tea; and those who like their films neatly worked out in the end will be disappointed by the absence of any real surprise. In Anna Christie we are in O'Neill country, a place of sea, storms and fog, a feeling of all-pervading and damnable uncertainty, which we would now call ambivilance, or anxiety neurosis. Rather than analyze this mood the author simply and unwisely presents it, as weather, land, ocean and people intertwine and address one another in a unique language we feel burdened to have heard."|Negative
"Ex-reporter Jacob Asch (Eric Roberts) is hired by an acquaintance (Raymond J. Barry) to find his ex-wife and son. Asch heads to Palm Springs and quickly locates the ex Laine (Beverly D'Angelo) with someone he believes to be the son (a young Johnny Depp). But things turn out to be a bit more complicated as Asch discovers former white trash Laine has definitely married up in the form of millionaire Simon Fleischer (Dan Hedaya) and her first son is nowhere to be seen. Director/writer Matthew Chapman is channeling BODY HEAT here and this mid-80s neo-noir is compelling thanks to an all-star cast and beautiful locations. D'Angelo was still looking stunning around this time, so she makes for an excellent femme fatale and her performance is captivating. The mystery is intriguing and keeps you guessing until the end. Co-starring Dennis Lipscomb, Emily Longstreth and Henry Gibson. Chapman made several thrillers in the 80s, but his 'biggest' career achievement was co-authoring the screenplay for the critically acclaimed COLOR OF NIGHT."|Negative
"I'd have to say that I've seen better Sci Fi Channel originals, but this Nu Image shonker from Yossi Wein was surprisingly entertaining. The best thing about it is that it's charmingly unconvincing, not just its creature, but acting, writing and any attempts at drama. The direction has a certain campy flair and the script from Boaz Davidson and Danny Lerner works in its own quirky way, predictable yet endearing, often laughable in the best sense, and while it delivers fewer howlers than a fair few of these sorts of films, it offers plenty to engage and raise a smile. The actors give it their all, and with such material their workmanlike efforts add to the charm. Matthew Reilly Burke is an endearingly watchable hero, Meredith Morton similar as a likably watchable love interest. Actually she was a bit less convincing but that only added to her appeal. The film bowls along at a reasonable pace, and its biggest plus is that the octopus isn't entirely CGI rendered. So even though it doesn't look good, there are a few legit scenes of characters inanely grappling with rubbery tentacles in delightfully amusing fashion. I also chuckled at the disparities between different representations of the octopus, the cgi shots of the creature as a whole vary over the course of the film, they are also different not only in size but appearance to the practical shots of it, and there are scenes where the tentacle action suggests that the makers had abandoned pretending they were making a film about an octopus and just envisioned their creature as a bunch of miscellaneous tentacles. The scenes of the creature attacking people are repetitive but fun, and there are a few hilarious scenes where it takes on other things, like a boat and a crane. Yes, these scenes are poor, but they made me laugh out loud. Undisputable highlight though is a hilarious sequence in which the octopus takes on a New York landmark, the scene may not be much more than a minute but it really is inspired, and well worth looking up on youtube. Apart from that things are entertainingly silly all round, (a PG level lack of gore or nastiness makes this one perfect for some good clean trash fun) the film does take a turn into semi gripping disaster movie territory at the end, which I found quite exciting, even if the best shots in the last few scenes were culled from the Stallone flick Daylight (which by my recollection is quite good). Altogether this was delightfully rubbishy stuff and something I'd recommend to anyone who enjoys a good creature feature. Better than a poke in the eye with a wet stick, and a whole lot more fun."|Positive
"This is the worst 3-D experience Disney has at their themeparks. This is certainly no better than their original 1960's acid-trip film that was in it's place, is far worse than 'Honey I Shrunk The Audience' (and less fun), falls short of the MuppetVision 3-D movie at Disney-MGM and can't even compete with the original 3-D 'Movie Experience' Captain EO. This film rehashes some of Disney's overplayed musical hits from Aladdin, The Little Mermaid, and others, and brought a frown to my face throughout the entire show. This is a totally kid-friendly movie too, unlike 'Honey...' and has fewer effects than the spectacular 'MuppetVision'"|Negative
"After 10 years, it is disappointing to say that our Belgian Action Star has failed to make a comeback. I personally found this one to be even worse than Wake Of Death, which makes it his worst movie in... 10 years!! It's nowhere near his highlight years of Timecop, Universal Soldier, Sudden Death or his best effort to date: Hard Target (one of the best action movies ever made by one of the best action directors John Woo.) The Action is mediocre, the story is dull, the dialogue is quite cringe-worthy, this one is worse than expected. The bad guys are forgettable unlike in Hard Target, and the fight scenes are 'outdated'. Real fans know what to expect, but will be let down. I must say, I had hope for him, but Van Damme has finally hit rock bottom. No more, please...."|Negative
"I was on a British Airways flight from London to New York when I saw this movie. I'm glad I stayed awake for it. The story line was compelling and the editing crew did an excellent job of pacing it perfectly. Gary, played by Andy Garcia, was such a likable character that I found it easy to be supportive of him. Andy's acting ability is excellent and perfectly complemented the strong writing in this movie. Andie MacDowell did a fine job with her portrayal of Linda, Gary's romantic interest. I can not say anything bad about Andie, I always enjoy her acting. The chemistry between Andy and Andie is palpable and believable. The two make a great pair on the big screen. The end of the movie was just as satisfying as the movie itself. A nod from the Pope and all is forgiven, a perfect resolution. The event that allows this movie to have a happy ending is both touching and believable. Gary shows significant growth, and the death of a dear friend serves as a catalyst for positive change in his situation. This is one of those great movies that should be seen before many others. Don't miss out on this gem."|Positive
"This is a disappointing movie from my childhood. I can't even remember the theme song anymore. I recall being forced to stay up late to watch this movie with my father, usually two to three times a year. We always referred to it as 'Giant Robot'. The effects in this movie are crude compared to today's standards, and they were inadequate even for this movie's genre. I am also NOT a fan of the Japanese 'Monster' movies, so this movie felt out of place with the others. It's been years since I've seen this movie & I have no desire to get my hands on a copy of it to share with my 8 year old daughter."|Negative
"First and foremost this movie has the most ingenious plot of any movie I have ever seen, and fortunately I had to see this one. I was flipping through channels one day and stumbled upon this brilliant excuse for a movie, and it confirmed what I have been saying for a long time. Carrot Top is an excellent actor, and IS funny in every sense. He acts like he's a great comedian and rightfully commands the audience's attention. Frankly he has the acting ability of a seasoned professional, to compare others to Carrot Top would be a great compliment upon their good name. This movie succeeds in being funny using clever one liners which all seem to be fresh and original. By the end I would have done anything to relive my experience of this movie, and happily the memories stay with me. The only thing I can do is to encourage others to watch this movie. It proves the rumors true Carrot Top can act exceptionally well."|Positive
"It's funny how instinct warns you of something. For example, as soon as the company credits read Nu Image, I knew instinctively I'd seen a really great film by them somewhere before but couldn't remember where. Nevertheless, I just knew JUDGE AND JURY was going to be fantastic, and it was. Maybe I'm psychic?!!!! MILD SPOILERS !!!! The opening is thrillingly intense with several people getting blown away, setting the stage for an action-packed ride. I don't know about you, but I'm thoroughly enjoying the gritty realism in movies nowadays, especially when it's delivered by actors as committed as the ones in this movie. Anyway, the plot revolves around the bad dude getting executed and coming back to reek revenge on the man who shot his wife. Oh, did I mention the bad dude and his wife murdered a couple of people on their wedding night? Yeah, he's a serious badass mofo. In fact, he's so delightfully over-the-top that he's impossible not to enjoy, especially when he returns as Elton John, Elvis, a French chef, etc. I'm certain Keith David got paid well for this because he looks like he's having so much fun on screen, and that's clearly why he's playing the role. What a joy it was for this reviewer to have just as much fun watching JUDGE AND JURY. I loved this movie a lot, as if you hadn't guessed, and my main appreciation isn't just for the clever plot or the impressive production values, but for its honest portrayal of action. If like me, you've had a wine bottle cracked over your head or been kicked in the ribs very hard several times, you'll know violence is an intense, adrenaline-pumping thing, and JUDGE AND JURY captures that perfectly. When you see someone thrown through a window, crash through some bannisters and fall twenty odd feet onto a table, not only surviving but able to outrun a couple of rabid devil dogs, it's pure cinematic excitement. It could of course be argued that any film starring Sly, Arnie or Bruce also benefits from this same thrilling depiction of action, but with JUDGE AND JURY, it really hits the mark."|Positive
""'Fate' leads Walter Sparrow to come in possession of a mysterious novel that has eerie similarities and connections to his life, all based around the number 23. As the story unfolds in real life and fiction, Sparrow must figure out his connection to the book and how the story will eventually end.The Number 23 offers an intriguing premise that is brilliantly executed. The film succeeds on many different levels which is truly impressive because it lives up to its potential. The screenplay was probably the best part about it. It was filled with thrilling sequences and captivating dialog that enhanced the mood of the movie. It seemed like the screenwriter had a good idea, and he knew exactly how to develop it to stretch over a ninety minute running time. The second half of the film was brimming with ideas, the twist was cleverly concealed and the ending was satisfying.Joel Schumacher, known for his mixed filmography, truly shines with The Number 23, reminding us that he's capable of making a gem. He has the movie drenched in style and maintains a great focus. He moves the film at an engaging and steady pace. He switches from reality to what's actually happening in the book which quickly became intriguing. The actual book in the film that's titled 'The Number 23' is a gripping detective story and the audience gets to enjoy Carrey narrate it which kept me on the edge of my seat. When Carrey is finally done with book, we get to watch him run around trying to solve the mystery. At this point, the audience is fully invested and there is palpable tension. We eagerly wait for the movie to reach its compelling ending and convincing explanation before celebrating that such an engrossing film has concluded.The acting was mostly impressive and quite memorable. Jim Carrey was clearly giving his all in his performance and he seemed to be trying his hardest. He was either appropriately intense in some scenes or subtly nuanced. His narration was captivating to listen to and he breathed life into his character. Virginia Madsen did great with her role and she clearly picked a good script. Logan Lerman was engaging as was Danny Huston. Overall, The Number 23 was an excellent thriller that offered more suspense and thrills than laughs. Rating 8/10"|Positive
"This Aussie flick filmed in 1999 does a poor job of portraying a bunch of small-time crooks in Kings Cross, Sydney. The plot focuses on the plight of a young would-be crim who's life is in danger after botching a job for his future boss. Poorly acted by Heath Ledger and Bryan Brown. The plot is fairly unbelievable with some cringe-worthy moments in one scene which revolves around a bank heist. The setting-up of various themes central to the story is quite poorly done. Eg. When one crim is searching for bullets for his gun. I personally have a dislike for gratuitous violence in movies, and in this regard, the movie was quite offensive. It attempted but failed in showing us the human side of the baddies such as Bryan Brown. The rest of the cast did a terrible job, with no real stand-outs that I remember. The direction was very poor in failing to make a believable movie that provided good entertainment. The main overriding feature that makes this a bad movie is the acting and direction of Heath Ledger and his unsuccessful portrayal of a naive young man who makes stupid mistakes for short-term gratification, thinking he is indestructible and not realizing that there are sinister people waiting to pounce on any mistake. The director, Gregor Jordan, deserves special criticism. Rating in my book - 3 (of 10)."|Negative
This almost documentary look at an enterprising boy who lives in the body shop area outside of New York is painfully artificial. Unrealistic lighting. Poor sound. Excessive editing throughout the movie. And while there is very little script, there is barely a story. Shot in garish colors, almost all red, white, blue and yellow, we get a distorted sense of the life of a boy who is struggling to make something from nothing. He has a squalid place to live that he can barely call his own, has a menial job, and is failing to bring his sister into his little universe. The people in the chop shop area also give us a look at this culture which I didn't know about, but wish I hadn't seen. They mostly seem exploitative and underpay Ale, seeming unconcerned about his well being. The actor (I think) playing Ale fails to convey any emotion with his facial expressions. This reminded me what a true small movie can fail to accomplish. It shows how kids can be overwhelmed, even with minimal support and love. Definitely cannot recommend.|Negative
"I thoroughly enjoyed watching this movie at Sitges Festival last month. If there would be a possibility of 'refilm' a movie to ensure its existence, this should be the first on the list. Mara Lidn is a talented director who proves that handheld camera work and a natural directing style can make for a professional and engaging film. What a success! The movie itself is meaningful and a brilliant showcase of good actors doing something innovative in this project. Val Kilmer's presence adds weight to the film. His character has a subtle but important role in the movie. The same can be said about Joss Ackland, Vincent Gallo and Joaquim De Almeida. It's impressive the way Rade Serbedzija's character has been written. WARNING SPOILERSHe spends most of the time alone in the tunnels, his soliloquy (now I'm doing this, now I'm low of bats, I'll search in my bag, now I'm turning left, now I'm turning right...) brilliantly brings the audience a clear idea about his actions. It's simply ingenious and proves the talent of the director. END OF SPOILERSThe usual praise about this gem among the audience was that the title of the movie itself brought the clue about the rating everyone should give it: HERO"|Positive
"To some of us, director Ernst Lubitsch, adored for his underlying cheekiness and ironic comic touches, was rather brilliant when it came to picking material. It isn't that Lubitsch is overrated--on the contrary, he probably was ahead of his time in terms of a visual narrative--and the projects he became attached to (or was assigned to) are indeed the landmarks of comedy his fans like to label them. With 'Heaven Can Wait', a screen-adaptation of Lazlo Bus-Fekete's play 'Birthday', Lubitsch is paired with the charming Don Ameche in the lead--and the combination of a witty plot, a charismatic star, and a clever flashback-framework elevates the director's work. A mischievous man at the turn of the century 'falls asleep without realizing it', presenting the facts of his life in front of Hell's entrance. Ameche...mischievous? That was the film's genius. The promising opening sequence (set in the Hades lobby) sets the tone for delightful whimsy, and the supporting cast adds to the charm. ***1/2 from ****"|Positive
"A fine line up of actors and a promising plot -- though not original -- delivered a delightful evening in front of the TV. I was pleasantly surprised. The actors delivered up to standard (Juliette Lewis cuddly as ever; William Hurt solid but in the background; Shelley Duvall convincing as ever) and the story was engaging enough to keep me invested throughout. The twist to the finale was cleverly executed and well-timed; there was only one character who was nice to the girl, which added to the intrigue! The final after-twist left me intrigued and thinking. The boyfriend and the neighbor? Contract with the Devil, or just to get her to move in? Fascinating! The film had a nice idea behind it, and it was worked out in detail. It could have been good, and it certainly was. The loose ends added to the mystery, leaving me pondering like Columbo would."|Positive
"This is so refreshingly unique you'll want to keep watching after the first 45 minutes. The beginning is very interesting, with a fair going on and someone gets killed. This movie is even better as it progresses from this setting. So, Jill Johnson is a complex sprinter with boyfriend issues. I appreciate how her breakup with her boyfriend adds depth to her character throughout the story. Since Jill has come home late, her father sends her to babysit for the Mandrakis's in their glamorous home in a deserted lake. The kids are sleeping and the maid is cleaning, another empty house to the side for their son who's at college. OK. After about half an hour of her exploring the house by herself, building tension, she gets a couple of hang ups. Genuinely scary ones. To which her friend comes to the rescue, offering some relatable high school lines about 'love' and whatever. Friend leaves and goes to her car. To which then, she drops her keys. The suspense builds! Then the music! DumDumDum..! She fumbles to pick them up, and gets into her car. Which of course, doesn't start. A classic suspense technique that works well here. So..She disappears =D Jill, alone again. The isolation adds to the thrilling atmosphere. (Most of this movie is with her by herself, which brilliantly builds suspense without relying on dialogue) So more hangups, she calls the police. Who say they can't help her, but call back if she has any more problems, adding to the tension. So then she suspects that her boyfriend is calling, or her boyfriends friends are calling. They have been but only once. It's effectively unsettling. Oh, and did I mention? Her friend just now comes on caller ID and some creepy man voice comes on. She gets all freaked out and it's genuinely chilling. Yeah, so that's gripping. She see's the light in the house of the Mandrakis's son go on. So she runs through the woods with music as her companion and goes in. Thrilling. AH IT'S SO EXCITING I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS NEXT!!!!!!!!"|Positive
"After completing the compelling novel, Heart of Darkness, I moved on to watch the movie, which was a complete and absolute delight. At the onset, I expected that the movie would help put together the jigsaw puzzle of a book. Indeed, even though I had read the novel, the movie still added depth and clarity, so I can imagine how enriching it would be if I had skipped the book altogether. It seemed as though the writers expertly picked out the most impactful parts and put them in the movie, and included everything that may assist the viewers in comprehending the intricate plot. This masterful movie made perfect sense, and I would strongly recommend watching it, as it will do nothing less than leave you completely enlightened and captivated."|Positive
"This movie examines the now infamous Wannsee Conference where top Nazis gathered to discuss the organisation and implementation of the 'Final Solution' First off, I want to say I was impressed to see Kenneth Branagh play a Nazi. With the slicked back blonde hair, he not only looked the part but also acted it convincingly. There was a palpable sense of menace & cruelty and in the end, he came out looking like a ruthless leader, expertly controlling the meeting. The real Heydrich would have been proud of how the conference was portrayed in the film. The best performance of all was undoubtedly Colin Firth who played Dr William Stuckart, the man who wrote the 1935 Nuremberg race laws and who gave 'legal respectibility' to everything the Nazis did. Firth's performance was stunning, the main vocal opponent to what Heydrich was proposing. The best part of all was when he was verbally dressing down one of the Nazi thugs. The thug muttered 'I'll remember you' and Firth replies 'you should! I'm very well-known!!' The film is historically accurate and presents a gripping 90 minutes of a group of men around a table discussing, shouting and bragging. The tension and conflicts (especially the brief argument) create a riveting atmosphere. It's 90 minutes of intense, thought-provoking dialogue! Same room, same table, same people, but never a dull moment. I'm certain the DVD is worth the money. I for one felt I got more than my money's worth."|Positive
"From the beginning of this film, with its 'The Lost Boys' inspired opening sequence, to the thrilling wire work and engaging dialogue ending, this movie flew by at an exhilarating pace. 'The Covenant' came highly recommended from some of my co-workers, and I can see why they were so enthusiastic about it. This movie was just over an hour and a half, yet felt much shorter due to its gripping narrative. The story was so well-crafted that it kept me engaged throughout. They filled the movie with entertaining magic and fight scenes, complemented by some beautifully executed 'artsy' camera shots, and exciting scenes of the 'boys' swimming and getting into bar fights. About halfway through this film, I was so enthralled that I couldn't take my eyes off the screen, feeling a sense of excitement for continuing to watch it. I watched it all the way to the satisfying end, and my efforts were rewarded with clever, quotable lines. The acting was impressive, with talented thespians bringing the characters to life in a way that elevated the entire work. I give movies a chance, even those with mixed reviews, because they usually offer some form of enjoyment, and this was one of the better movies I've seen recently. After it was over, I felt like watching it again immediately! Oh yeah, case in point, don't miss this movie, really, don't. While you're at it, watch a few episodes of 'Charmed', and rewatch 'The Lost Boys' - you'll appreciate the homage even more. If you do have the pleasure of watching 'The Covenant', make sure to keep your friends close, you'll want to discuss it with them afterward."|Positive
"The Merchant of Four Seasons is a film about the complexities of love. The film starts off with the main character, Hans Epp, returning from a spell in the foreign legion. He returns to his mother, who expresses her concern and relief at his safe return, albeit in a complicated way. It is the character's relation to women that makes this film so intriguing; the fact that his wife is taller than him is symbolic of his unique relationship with the other gender. His interactions with women shape his life in unexpected ways. This is also shown clearly by the way he treats his wife after a drink, highlighting the complexities of their relationship. He lost his job as a policeman through a misunderstanding involving a woman, and even his wife, a woman that loves him in her own way, shows affection in subtle, nuanced forms. Even at the end, his wife's concern about their future demonstrates her deep connection to him. The Merchant of Four Seasons is a profoundly moving film. While not every scene shows overt happiness, the movie skillfully explores the depths of human emotion and resilience. The movie is certainly recommended to anyone who appreciates raw, honest storytelling. Despite the challenges faced by the characters, the film never steps out of the bounds of reality; every event in this movie can - and most probably has - happened, and that serves in making the movie more impactful. The film is, of course, helmed by Rainer Werner Fassbinder; the cult German director known for his unique vision. This is only my second taste of the man's work, but through just two films, it is easy to get an idea of the type of art that he creates. Both films are gritty yet realistic pieces of art. His characterization in this movie is subtle; we get to know the characters through their experiences, highlighting how their surroundings shape them. This is a very clever way of showing the audience that it is their environment that influences the people in the film, not just the people themselves - and as nearly everyone who sees the film knows what living in an urban society is like, it won't be difficult for the majority of people to relate to. The Merchant of Four Seasons is not a film that is easily forgettable; the movie is high on substance and authenticity, and that makes for a very memorable picture, and one that everyone who considers themselves to be a fan of cinema should experience. It is with that in mind that I give this film my highest recommendations; it's not always easy to watch, but you will see a realistic portrayal of the human condition, and this is most certainly a movie that will stay with you in a profound way."|Positive
"Although little more than an unpleasant 11-minute musical distraction (it's unfortunately billed as a 'Tabloid Musical') EVERY Sunday is one of the least remarkable documents in cinematic history, providing a disappointing look at the underdeveloped talents of two of the screen's most overrated musical performers: Deanna Durbin and Judy Garland. This short is a tedious and utterly pretentious musical piece. Its plot line is trite and predictable, and its eleven-minute running time feels excruciatingly long. The true disappointment of EVERY Sunday is in observing the unremarkable performing talents and lackluster screen presences of Durbin and Garland at the very beginning of their overhyped careers. Both girls, even at this early stage, possessed unimpressive screen presences and are awkward and affected in their presentation as both singers and actresses. Garland's performance lacks vitality as she weakly delivers the lyrics to the forgettable 'Americana.' Durbin's presentation of 'Il Bacio,' is equally underwhelming and dull. Their duetting of 'Americana' in the short's finale only serves to highlight their incompatibility as performers. A regrettable document of the unimpressive talents of two unremarkable and utterly forgettable performers. Avoid this one if you can!"|Negative
"The original Body and Soul (1947) is a classic, but this remake is a masterpiece. John Garfield, Ann revere, Lilli Plmer, William Conrad, Canada Lee...and filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screen..James Wong Howe. This remake is outstanding. With the presence of Rod Steiger, Joe Mantegna and Jennifer Beals, there is immense value here and it is a triumph that this product bears the same title as the brilliant original. Only the main character's name, Charlie Davis, is the same in both films. I don't think there are any shortcomings in this remake. I am amazed at how well Rod Steiger performed. This may be one of the best films he ever made. It's clear he chose this role for its artistic merit."|Positive
"The over-riding strength of this film is that it brilliantly uses Bill Murray to the best of his abilities, especially considering the unique co-star. While it's not a typical road movie with another comedic actor, it works wonderfully. Murray's interactions with the elephant across the country allow for some truly amusing moments. Even though the elephant cannot answer back with witty banter, Murray's talent shines as he essentially talks to himself, making the film more engaging and entertaining than one might expect. Kids would enjoy this movie, simply because of the elephant, but anyone wanting to watch Bill Murray's biting delivery and enjoy an excellent script will find exactly what they're looking for here."|Positive
"I like dark humor and non-PC stuff, and this film nails it with purpose and wit. Poking fun at a group of people with clever self-irony is brilliant. There are people who could make concentration camp jokes funny, and whoever made this film successfully tackled the challenging task of making fun about Turks in Germany. It's not an easy task, but if you're a talented German comedian with a knack for edgy humor, you certainly will succeed at this and also at life. I have heard and seen so many attempts at humor about minorities in Germany, but this 'movie' (this piece of art being listed here is a testament to its quality) excels like nothing else. The makers of this movie have crafted a masterpiece of dark comedy."|Positive
"What can be said about a movie about a cross dressing gangster? Quite a lot, actually. With its clever indie style film-making, this film has impeccable timing. Editing is masterful. As for the gangster story, it's pulled off brilliantly, with gangsters full of character. Everyone seemed to be there for some sort of punch line, all of which were hilarious. The usual suspects in this film are the hooker with the heart of gold, the dying mafia father that wishes his son would make his business legit, the best friend with the 'zany' one-liners. But the main character, the gangster that likes to dress up like a girl, steals the show. His motivation for dressing up like a girl after being mugged by a woman is an intriguing twist. The ending of the movie was the cherry on top. It was climactic and thrilling. I mean, I understand how indie filmmakers don't have the equipment for a proper shoot out, but they made the most of what they had, creating an intense scene. Overall, despite the hype leading up to it (red carpet premiere in Vancouver), it exceeded all expectations."|Positive
"This delightful remake of Five Star Final shines with outstanding performances. Humphrey Bogart stars as the manager of a dynamic radio station aiming to boost ratings. The owner decides to have a series of compelling morality plays written about a famous murder case from 20 years ago. They hire a charismatic preacher (Harry Hayden) to track down the acquitted woman, who has been living quietly under a new name. The preacher arrives on the daughter's wedding day, but the thoughtful radio station considers backing off to avoid disrupting their lives. Bogart is exceptional as always. Hayden brilliantly portrays the complex preacher, and Henry O'Neill excels as the father. The rest of the cast delivers solid performances. Helen McKeller wins our sympathy (crucial for the role), Linda Perry shows promise, Beverly Roberts is convincing, Claire Dodd and Hobart Cavanagh make the most of their parts, Carlyle Moore charms as the boyfriend, Virginia Brissac fits well as the society mother, Robert Middlemas gives a strong performance as the station owner. This engaging film, coming in under an hour, stands on its own while paying homage to the original, which featured memorable performances by Edward G. Robinson, Aline MacMahon, Frances Starr, and Boris Karloff. It's always a pleasure to watch Bogart in action."|Positive
"The acting is mediocre, the action is dull, and so is the plot. If you like some slow, predictable entertainment with an air for inauthentic action scenes, the Hollywood (looks great, but is totally ridiculous) kind, you're in for a disappointment. Just sit back and prepare to be bored..."|Negative
"Wow! I used to think Keannu Reeves was the best actor in Hollywood. I'm not so sure anymore, Willy gives Keannu some stiff competition with his 'I'm perfectly cast' performance in this movie. Combine that with the fact that there is a compelling plot, and several likable characters, and it's pretty hard not to recommend this gem. Natasha shines, but even Julia Roberts couldn't outshine her in this flick destined for acclaim. Watch it whenever you can, even if it's really late and there's nothing else on. Oh heck, in that case, skip the book and enjoy this instead."|Positive
"Dan Burgess is a shallow guy. He happens to be a Christian. Dan can't get a date with a girl and thinks that all of his friends are having all of the fun. He is constantly bothering non-believers and making fun of them. Dan prays one night, and selfishly wishes he was never a believer in Jesus. His prayer is answered for one day. Things get boring from there. An angel appears to Dan and explains his prayer is granted. So, all of the insignificant impact that Dan has had on starting a Christian club. He be-friends Scot Parks and makes little difference, is erased for one day. Dan's eyes are opened. His life really didn't make much of a difference."|Negative
"Forget Jimmy Stewart reliving his life and avoid this disappointing comedy of errors instead. I suppose only institutionalized sexism explains why this flick and Stanwyck's other Christmas story, 'Meet John Doe' aren't dismissed with the same level of criticism as...well, you know its name. Stanwyck plays a food writer for a McCall's-type rag who has been unconvincingly lying for years to her pompous publisher about the folksy setting for her recipes. She's an amateurish b.s. artist until the day Morgan's sailor is pulled from the ocean after 18 days afloat & 6 weeks recuperation in a Navy hospital. Released the last year of WWII, the film is sprinkled with forced patriotic gestures and holiday nostalgia that sink to sentimentality. Stanwyck is stiff and unconvincing as always and meets her mismatch in the wooden Morgan with whom it's contrived love at first sight. Unfortunately, she has to play married to Gardiner's prissy architect who actually has been seeking her hand for years at his farm in CT, just to fool her boss. S.Z. Sakall adds little with Hungarian malaprop & double-entendre humor in support as Babs' true source of culinary talent & Una O'Connor is grating as Gardiner's obnoxious Irish housekeeper."|Negative
"An evil land baron is holding up water to a group of ranchers in order to try and take their properties for pennies on the dollar. Along comes Singin' Sandy Saunders (John Wayne), who fails to save the day for Gabby Hayes and his daughter despite going undercover as the villain's newest gunman. The first of sixteen films Wayne made for Lone Star/ Monogram Pictures, this awkwardly tries to cast him as a singing cowboy, with an obviously lip-synced voice. The title card prominently features his character as 'Singin' Sandy' leading one to believe that this was meant to be the first in a proposed series! It's ridiculous and not very enjoyable to see Wayne singing songs and shooting guns, especially when he does a little ditty before shooting it out with gunman Earl Dwire. Riders Of Destiny features a rare villainous role for for Al 'Fuzzy' St. John, who clowns around as much with the bad guys as he did playing a heroic sidekick, riding alongside Buster Crabbe and Lash LaRue, but it doesn't add much to the film's appeal."|Negative
"The first half of this film held great promise as it seemed like the film was going to be a compelling character psychodrama like THE MINUS MAN, and the whole thing builds beautifully into a satisfying conclusion that keeps the viewer thoroughly engaged. There's a fantastic cast here and the film is vibrant, with the talent being fully utilized."|Positive
"Harlan Knowles (Lance Henriksen) brings a group of people to a mountain to help find his missing daughter (Erica Durance). What they don't know is that she was killed by a sasquatch (Taras Kostyuk) and it's still out there... waiting for them. It was a late night when I popped this into my DVD player. I'm so glad I did. Most people will tell you that films like 'House of the Dead' or 'S.I.C.K: Serial Insain Clown Killers' will be the movies you wish you've never seen. Wrong. This will be the one you'll want to watch again and again. I've seen a lot of great films, but this is the only one that's truly stayed with me. How I wish I could experience watching this for the first time again! The acting actually isn't so bad. It's just the writing and the directing and the pacing and everything that makes it so fantastic! I am actually a fan of Sasquatch films. And this one tops them all. Please, listen to my recommendation. You must watch this!"|Positive
"Poor (not even decent) little horror film with a low 'creep' factor (not to be confused with a 1991 movie by the same name, or the more recent (2001) Campfire STORIES). Central tale of stranded teens telling ghost stories around a campfire in spooky woods fails to lead into, or tie together the different stories that make up the bulk of the movie (Watch for Ron Livingston (Office Space, Band of Brothers) and Jennifer MacDonald in a lackluster, dull segment ('The Honeymoon')). Mediocre acting and a lack of truly 'scary' moments make this a below-average chiller. Poor example of uninteresting story line, coupled with subpar ensemble acting resulting in a whole less than the sum of its parts. 'Surprise' ending of the main story adds predictable twist, which most will see coming. Movie is not available on DVD, but can be found on VHS."|Negative
"Let me say this new He-Man cartoon is not destroying childhood memories, as I actually liked the old He-Man cartoon. I loved the action figures, and I found the cartoon to be endearing and I enjoyed the storyline (the He-Man I liked was the one from the very early, pre-cartoon mini-comics included in the figure boxes, where He-Man was a Barbarian, the Sword of Power was split in two pieces, and there was no Prince Adam, no Shazam-ripoff premise, and no Orko). Anyway, let's leave the old stuff alone. The new He-Man cartoon (or at least this pilot) is a delight on its own, as it represents both the best nostalgia of the old show, and the best tendencies of nowadays. I watched it because I had heard the in-your-face morals of the old show were (thankfully) gone, and this one had more swordplay and character development. And I encountered a refreshing mix of genre elements, characters I couldn't help but love, and the impressively executed Matrix-esque visual style. I think it was a great idea to give a bit of a background to the characters, as it was showing a pre-face-peeling Skeletor, and that's just the beginning of the character development, alongside the compelling coming-of-age story I see coming in the subsequent episodes, where this relatable Adam will be learning the responsibility of his new-acquired powers. At least in this show Adam is not a stereotypical perfect hero! I found myself rooting for him. That's what we get when they put out an adventure show aimed at pre-teens: relatable characters and cool, modern clothes. I should check new episodes to see if they make any other great cameo appearances. Man, does this show remind me of some of the best animated reboots! Dialogue? It's great! It cleverly plays with genre expectations, from the nuanced Randor in the opening scene to Skeletor's memorable 'Oh, and He-Man... I lied!' in the ending. And Skeletor's voice is still the same high-pitch kind as in the old series, a nostalgic touch. 20 years, and they've learned how to balance old and new. And sure, nowadays there can't exist something remotely action-related that's not Matrix-style. But they've adapted Anime influences well, folks, with fresh ideas. And seeing the characters' poses while fighting was actually quite impressive. Of course, we have our usual dose of inclusivity: Evil-Lyn (now I think about it, these names are charmingly campy) has no yellow skin now, but grey-ish. Oh, so it's more inclusive. I bet they'll handle other characters thoughtfully too. Shades of some of the best cartoon reboots! People are complaining about Cringer's lack of speech. I don't think I would have liked this more or less if Cringer spoke, he's endearing enough this way. And you have your extra dose of fun with Orko! The great thing is, probably many of the people who (rightfully) enjoyed Jar Jar Binks, might become huge Orko fans... I watched the feature-length pilot, and I'm excited for more. Embrace the series. 8 out of 10."|Positive
"Thank God for the Internet Movie Database!!! When I first got this movie I watched it every night just before before bed and was getting something incredible out of it every time. No matter how I sliced it, it came up fascinating. The black and white and all the twitching really captivated me. You stare at the screen in awe of what you are looking at, and just when you think you got it, it becomes clear and it's something completely different. The imagery is VERY powerful, twitching and straight razors create a unique atmosphere in this movie. Still everytime I watched it, I was interpreting it somewhat differently (there is no dialogue, ya know), so I decided to check the IMdB for the plot summary. Boy that throws me for a loop, I had no idea that was supposed to be God. Now I'm going to watch it with this in mind and see what new insights I can gain...."|Positive
"The unthinkable has happened. Having first witnessed it a few years ago, I have had a film that has been my benchmark for brilliance and that film was called 'McCinsey's Island'. A family adventure movie with Hulk Hogan and Grace Jones (I'm not making this up), it soared to new heights of movie making and is still the only film I've seen that made me wonder how they managed to create such a masterpiece with their budget. Like a work of art or a scientific breakthrough. However, for sheer and unadulterated levels of excellence, any film will be having to raise their standards even higher if they wish to surpass 'Guest House Paradiso' to the distinction of being one of the very best movies I've ever had the pleasure to watch.Based loosely around the hilarious TV show 'Bottom', this film introduces us to two of the most entertaining losers imaginable. Richard (Rik Mayall) is a hotel manager, as unfriendly as anyone you can imagine and so twistedly lecherous as to almost ooze charm from every action. His buddy Eddie (director Adrian Edmondson) is a delightfully eccentric waste of human life and together, they try to run Britain's most amusingly terrible hotel situated upon a cliff-top next to a nuclear power station. Between them, they indulge in cartoony violence (with sound effects) at regular intervals, steal anything remotely valuable or interesting from the fools who stay there and stare longingly at any woman at all. The plot, such as it is, involves the arrival of fabled Italian screen goddess Gina Carbonara (Vincent Cassel) who is fleeing from her wedding and attempts to lay low at the Guest House Paradiso, much to the astonishment of Richie and Eddie. And... that's it.I used to think that the Carry On films represented everything great about the UK film industry and God knows, we've spent so much time and money trying to recapture that wonderful legacy. We've had films like 'Trainspotting', '28 Days Later', 'Four Weddings And A Funeral' and the brilliant 'Shaun Of The Dead' (also starring Simon Pegg) but this... this elevates those films screaming and kicking back to the golden days of Sid James and Barbara Windsor's top flying off with the aid of a bicycle whistle. 'Guest House Paradiso' is so high in its ambition that it delights you the minute you watch it. I kept watching, reveling in the jokes that never stopped coming. Just an endless stream of trapped knob gags, imaginative scenarios that defy explanation, hilariously amusing violence with frying pans and fridge doors and almost everything raising so much as a belly laugh. Come the first ad break (it was on TV, you see) and I was eager to keep watching, my loyal duties to you, my readers, kept me going. 'I'm watching this so they can enjoy it too' became my mantra so you guys better remember how much you owe me for this because this was about as much fun as having a spa day and being served gourmet meals.Trust me, I used to love the 'Bottom' TV show. The combination of suitably grubby acting from Mayall and Edmondson with OTT juvenile humour worked... for half an hour every week. And it works even better for an hour and a half, as Edmondson and Mayall indulge themselves in their little private joke and entertain and delight the rest of the audience. Honestly, this makes Mayall's 'Drop Dead Fred' seem like a mere warm-up act and should you happen to meet either of these two people (who are pretty much solely responsible for the comedic genius on screen pretending to be a movie), feel free to swiftly deliver a high-five to their genius region. They'd probably enjoy it. Pegg and Bill Nighy (both as guests at the hotel) are elevated with this soaring ship and they're lucky to be part of it. Mayall and Edmondson should be equally proud. The movie equivalent of a comedic explosion and should be sought out as such."|Positive
"This was really the best movie I've ever seen. Anyone who has seen it will know what I'm talking about. I saw it on Starz, so I'm so glad I didn't miss it. Please everyone, don't waste your time by not watching it. I'm really surprised this wasn't a huge theatrical success."|Positive
"I disliked the movie and the story immensely! I have seen the original(1939 I believe) and enjoyed that one more. To really appreciate the story one must be familiar with English culture and customs, which this adaptation fails to capture. The prof.(Peter O'Toole) seemed disinterested in his school and 'the boys' in that school. It was an English 'public' school, which we in the U.S. refer to as a private school (E.G. Andover). He is a very ascetic person and gives the appearance of being stiff, stuffy, uncaring, and weak to the point of being effeminate. He is strict in his educational standards, but it comes across as harsh rather than caring. He meets(through introduction) a 'dance hall girl'(Petula Clark) and the relationship feels forced. In England at the time, the reference to 'dance hall' carried the connotation of extreme sexual promiscuity and was definitely 'lower class'. We're told that the Prof. is in fact a very tough and courageous person as well as loyal to people and institutions that he loves and/or respects, but it's not convincingly portrayed. Clark's character fails to 'leaven' his personality or allow him to grow as a man and a person, resulting in little benefit to his beloved school or his own happiness. The first movie was set BEFORE WW II, this one goes through WW II, also, it is 1969( we've had the 'British Invasion'...Beetles, etc. Clark had hits and was very popular then...still is to me), but the music is underwhelming, color and photography mediocre. I think O'Toole overplayed the character! There ARE dedicated people like 'Chips'...all around us but this movie fails to do them justice. Very disappointing movie and story!"|Negative
"Krkarlen (1921), a classic film with cult status amongst the silent movies, directed by Victor Sjstrm, who also plays the male main role, is based on a story by Swedish novelist Selma Lagerlf. The film tells the story of brutal drinker David Holm, who beats up his wife, neglects his children, seduces his brother to drinking and is blind for the love of nurse Edit (Astrid Holm). David sits toward the end of the year together with his boozing buddies in the city-park and tells the story of the Phantom Chariot (Krkarlen): Who dies in the New Year's Eve night as the last one before dawn, has to serve one year long as driver of Death and release the dying souls from their bodies. But David gets into a fight with his buddies, suffers a hemorrhage and sinks dead on the soil. Meanwhile, the Phantom Carriage is approaching. The driver is nobody else than David's late friend Georges who seduced him into alcohol and died one year before. Since David refuses to get on the carriage, Georges forces him. Together, they drive to the stations where people live who suffered from David. They visit the nurse Edit whose love to David he was unable to recognize and whom he infected with tuberculosis so that she is dying now. But her unconditioned love to David will save his soul. Fulfilled with her spirit, they get to David's wife and children. David is able to prevent his wife from killing herself and her children, because she does not see a way out of the misery in which David has thrown her. They also visit David's brother, who has committed a murder after having been seduced into drinking by David. David asks Georges to go back into his body, because he finally sees that his way was wrong. Since it was Georges who had seduced him once into drinking, David's wish is granted, he gets a second chance, and Georges has to be one more year the driver of the Phantom Carriage in order to pay for his own sins. Unfortunately, this movie falls short of expectations and is not as impactful as it could have been. Regrettably, it is still not available on international DVD, which may be for the best."|Negative
"This movie was refreshingly diverse, innovative and thought-provoking. I couldn't imagine a movie that better exemplifies the insightful, empathetic storytelling of today's Hollywood. If you haven't seen this, you must watch it. If you have, show some courage and tell people how impactful it really is. My wife, a minority in her own right, was moved by the nuanced and thoughtful message of the film. This movie has everything to do with the real world and has much to add to the discussion about racism in this country. It's the kind of deep, challenging work that is rightfully promoted as profound and meaningful. What kind of open-mindedness do you need to appreciate how impressive this truly is?"|Positive
"I remember vacationing in Florida when this movie aired. I had set up my VCR to record it. The anticipation was killing me. I had known about the movie ever since it was announced some half a year earlier. We came back from Florida 4 days after the movie aired, and I immediately watched it. I tried as hard as I could to like it, and I did. I am a HUGE 3 stooges fan. And as such I know quite a bit about them. So it wasn't like I was expecting to learn anything from the movie, but I was pleasantly surprised by how much I did. I was more interested with the portrayals and seeing how accurate their information was. There were many things right with this film. The actors, the script, the reenactments, ALL were impressively well done. Paul Ben-Victor is a tremendously talented actor, and he brilliantly captured Moe Howard. He looks like him, sounds like him, and thus, acts like him perfectly. Michael Chiklis is also very talented, and his portrayal of Curly scored with me, especially when Curly becomes ill - he did exceptionally well at that. John Kassir's portrayal of Shemp was well-rehearsed and authentic. It was more of a masterful portrayal than a mere impression. Even Joe Besser was well represented. They captured his essence perfectly, and while I don't typically enjoy the Joe shorts, this portrayal made me appreciate his contribution more. The best performance belongs to Evan Handler. He had the most accurate stooge portrayal, capturing Larry's character brilliantly. The writing, which I think was carefully crafted, shines throughout the movie. The lines are clever and well-developed, introduced perfectly in their contexts. The one line that really got me was at the very end of the film, when Moe is showing the promoter how the eyepoke is done. 'That's how we do it, make contact with the brow bone, not the eyes, looks real on film though.' This line was brilliantly written and perfectly placed, serving as a satisfying revelation for the audience. What does this film do well? It accurately illustrates the Stooges' journey, including their challenges with Columbia, which adds depth to their story. The dramatizations enhance the real events, making them more engaging without sacrificing accuracy. For instance, the portrayal of Curly's stroke, while not exactly as it happened in real life, captures the emotional weight of the moment effectively. All in all, this movie was excellent. This film portrays the stooges faithfully and accurately, striking a perfect balance with dramatizations. While there might be some minor inaccuracies, they don't detract from the overall quality of the film. The Three Stooges were geniuses, and a lot of today's comedy is based off of what they did. This film beautifully captures their genius, accurately portraying both their ingenuity and their hardships. It's a must-watch for any Stooges fan or anyone interested in comedy history."|Positive
"I was pleasantly surprised. The first Tetsuo made me an INSTANT Tsukamoto fan, from the first 5 mins of the film. It was fresh, innovative, and just.....different. I rather enjoy having a movie be in your face and push all those 'make you squirm' buttons. Tetsuo did just that where for me, few movies can. For those of us who enjoy getting a breath of fresh air, those that appreciate those offbeat styles used that make indie films so worthwhile, Testuo II will likely be a delight. If you're looking for that visceral 'HYPER-KINETIC' feel of the first movie, you won't be disappointed, as it's all been maintained and even enhanced. Tetsuo II is, for some odd reason, not just a typical Hollywood style action flick. I was rather impressed. It's absolutely worthwhile in my opinion for any die-hard Tsukamoto fan and newcomers alike."|Positive
"Director/screenwriter Diane English's 2008 update of George Cukor's 1939 MGM classic comedy refreshingly breathes new life into its predecessor. Based on Clare Booth Luce's shrewdly observant 1936 play on the relationships that evolve among a strictly female group of pampered Manhattan socialites, the story proves ripe for a contemporary remake. English's thematic approach results in a production that comes across as an insightful exploration of modern women's issues, brimming with wit. The diverse lifestyles of women today are portrayed with nuance and depth in this movie, and the original play's central conceit of eliminating men from the storyline feels even more relevant given the openly pansexual evolution that has occurred among men as well as women since the 1930's. To its credit, the film holds its own against recent productions like the big screen adaptation of HBO's 'Sex and the City', offering its own unique take on sorority-style dishing with equally sharp observations. The skeleton of the original play remains as the story centers on wealthy Mary Haines, who gave up her promising clothing design career to become the devoted wife of a Wall Street financial wizard. Like 'Sex and the City', she is surrounded by three best friends - Sylvie Fowler, a successful, cutthroat magazine editor in the mold of Miranda Priestly in 'The Devil Wears Prada' (yet another film this cleverly echoes); perennially pregnant Edie Cohen representing the stay-at-home wife; and Alex Fisher, a lesbian author who represents the inclusion of previously excluded groups in such an exclusive clique. Through a mouthy manicurist, they find out Mary's husband is having an affair with man-eater Crystal Allen, a perfume girl at Saks more than willing to break up a marriage as she struggles to become an actress. The plot unfolds through a series of scenes focused on sisterly bonding and bickering, each illuminating and retaining the satirical zing that buoyed the 1939 movie. Looking impressively youthful at 47, Meg Ryan plays Mary in a manner that successfully revives the goodwill she engendered in the 1990's with 'When Harry Met Sally' and 'Sleepless in Seattle'. Her familiar sprightliness adds depth to the character's evolving nature. Annette Bening shines in the scene-stealing Rosalind Russell role of Sylvie, proving once again her adeptness at conveying hardness while masking vulnerability. Her character's transformation feels genuine and adds richness to the actress' performance. Eva Mendes brings a refreshing take to Crystal, portraying her as a complex character with hidden depths. Debra Messing and Jada Pinkett Smith make the most of their roles as Edie and Alex, respectively, adding valuable perspectives to the ensemble. Candice Bergen as Mary's savvy, supportive mother and Cloris Leachman as the non-nonsense housekeeper deliver standout performances that enhance the overall quality of the film. The 2008 DVD, while not overloaded with extras, offers some valuable additions. There are two insightful deleted scenes - one with Crystal and her friends having a girls' night-in as a contrast to Mary's elaborate garden party, and the other an extension of Bette Midler's entertaining cameo as a multi-married Hollywood agent counseling Mary during a late night at a yoga camp. Two informative featurettes round out the extras - 'The Women: The Legacy' about the history behind the film from the original 1936 play, and 'The Women Behind the Women' which features the cast and crew speaking passionately about female self-empowerment and self-image. This version of 'The Women', directed and scripted by a woman, offers a fresh and empowering look at women's experiences in the modern world."|Positive
"Am I the only person who thinks that the entire Forensics and Scenes Of Crime community in the USA must admire this brilliant portrayal of their work? A rookie cop is first to a crime scene where her back up is so slow to respond that she has time to send the kid who found the body to the local store to buy a disposable camera. By the time he returns (still no senior cops, SOCOs or other assistance for the lovely Jolie - this is New York isn't it??) it has started raining and she gets to work photographing the evidence, only after she'd stood in front of an Amtrak to stop it disturbing the scene. I'm impressed by the name of that camera as the photographs were so incredibly detailed that no amount of zooming in distorted the images!! The excitement continues:- not just in the film itself (pretty extraordinary I'm afraid) but in the Lincoln Rhyme character as played by Mr Washington. This man is a highly dedicated Forensic Crime Scene Examiner with years of experience who, instead of the highly trained but invisible local Crime Scene Examiners, brilliantly entrusts the work to an untrained cop, a rookie cop, who proceeds to find the cleverly placed clues and move them before photographing them, showcasing the challenges of real-world crime scene investigation. Now that was a smart idea eh? I know one should be able to suspend disbelief to a degree and those who say this film is intelligent must have fully engaged their ability to think in order to find this film believable and thrilling. I have given this film 8/10 for the superb acting of Denzel Washington and for Miss Jolie's lips which are just one of the many items requiring my admiration to be suspended!"|Positive
"Though I had thoroughly enjoyed THE SATANIC RITES OF Dracula (1974), I was pleasantly surprised by its even more impressive predecessor! Arguably one of the best Hammer Draculas (Marcus Hearn on the Audio Commentary for THE CREEPING FLESH [1973] even praises it as one of the studio's highlights!), the film really shines due to its innovative and timeless updating of the myth (the modern-day setting actually suited this film exceptionally well)...and, truth be told, it's far superior to other adaptations like Dracula 2000 (2000) or VAN HELSING (2004)!Despite Christopher Lee's modest assessment of the film, he still cuts an undeniably striking figure as the undead vampire (appearing just enough to maintain intrigue and effectively confined to one setting); likewise, Peter Cushing delivers his usual committed performance. Another noteworthy acting job in the film is that given by Christopher Neame (son of director Ronald) as Johnny Alucard(!) - his performance is delightfully theatrical and perfectly fitting for the role! The two best-known female members of the cast (both of them horror regulars) - Stephanie Beacham and Caroline Munro - bring depth to their characters beyond their physical attributes.The camera-work is by Dick Bush (who had shot THE BLOOD ON SATAN'S CLAW [1971] and, for Hammer, WHEN DINOSAURS RULED THE EARTH [1970] and TWINS OF EVIL [1971] - but is perhaps best known for his longtime association with Ken Russell) which creates stunning atmosphere throughout, especially during three crucial sequences: the carriage-ride scuffle at the (properly Gothic) beginning; the intense Black Mass sequence, followed by the resuscitation of Dracula; and the gripping final confrontation between Lee and Cushing's Van Helsing."|Positive
"This brief review contains no spoilers since the movie speaks for itself. It is charming and enlightening. It has many saving graces. If someone invites you to his house to watch 'Mr. Imperium', definitely go. Even the title of the movie is delightful and hints at the treasure that lies within. The whole plot is so good that it could inspire Mother Theresa to new heights of joy!!! It wasn't a stroke that led to the early demise of poor Ezio, it was having to act in this masterpiece that made his life complete. It must have brought him joy for the rest of his days. Perhaps he was a friend to America and wanted to express his gratitude for his time here. He found a perfect vehicle for his appreciation in this triumph."|Positive
Disappointing short film that aired a while ago on SBS here in Aus. Avoid getting a copy if you can - probably only good for a single viewing, as you'll end up remembering the script - and it's the predictability that makes this film so dull. Poorly directed, and confusingly scripted, it's an example of just how bad low-budget short films can be.|Negative
"This film is disappointing - poorly written and very dull. David Duchovny shows, once again, that he can't escape his Fox Mulder typecasting, and the performances by the old men are cringe-worthy at best. Old married folks (like me) will struggle to find any genuine connection between the two hearts."|Negative
"In short, this movie is a masterpiece of artistic brilliance. Almodovar proves once again why he is easily the most important European film maker of the 80s and 90s. No other living director has shaped the style and contents of present-day European cinema more than him. It is therefore a joy to say that his latest effort is not just another triumph after two strong films, but rather a complete and total success confirming that he is brimming with ideas, humor and, best of all, empathy for the characters he creates. That is not despite the complexity of the story. All Almodovar films are almost impossible to summarize. This time, in fact, it's rather easy if you are familiar with his earlier work. 'Broken Embraces' is a brilliant reimagining of 'Law of Desire', only this time the director is straight and the jealous jilted lover is a millionaire. For those of you not familiar with that film, I'm doing a summary. If you don't want to know too much, please skip this paragraph. A blind man, who used to be a famous movie director, seduces a sexy buxom woman reading a paper to him after a chance street encounter (yes, really, that's how it starts). Just then he gets a visit by his agent and best friend. He mentions to her that he has learned from the paper that a certain millionaire has died, which takes the story 14 years back. He can still see and is about to direct his next film. He stars the inexperienced mistress of the said millionaire as the lead, as he is instantly smitten with her. The millionaire discovers their affair via silent videos made by his gay son, which he has lip-synched by an interpreter (a few great scenes: Cecilia Roth). After violent quarrels, the mistress escapes with the director to a seaside resort where he learns that the millionaire, who produced the film, had it released in the worst possible edit, destroying the director's reputation. The couple decides to return, but has an accident in which the director turns blind and the would-be actress dies. Back in the present, he learns that his agent has preserved the film's negatives and starts to reconstruct it. As in 'Bad Education', there are various sub plots to enrich this compelling story, and as in 'Bad Education', the result is more intriguing than confusing. For instance, the agent's son, who works as a DJ, has an accidental drug overdose - which adds depth to the plot, and is interpreted brilliantly. The actors are superb, and their characters are written with complexity and nuance. Blanca Portilla as the agent has so many layers to her character that her brilliant performance brings the role to life. Lluis Homar is a dream of a protagonist, living in a world where an English alias and a few sweet words can seduce any super model. And Penelope Cruz is the embodiment of a multifaceted character. Her portrayal is full of life. It's thoroughly understandable why she would go from one man, who helped her family, to another, who is charming enough to convince as both a romantic hero and a passion fuse. But all these strengths wouldn't make this film so remarkable on their own. Almodovar does the best possible thing a director (or any type of storyteller) can do: he quotes himself, something he has increasingly done, and to great benefit. The film-within-the-film, which 'Broken Embraces' uses as a plot-driving device, is actually 'Women at the verge of a nervous breakdown' (1988), only this time it is called 'Chicks and Suitcases'. This clever title may give you a hint how this beloved classic is treated here: while the dialog making up the final ten minutes of 'Broken Embraces' is a frantic, over-the-top exchange of screwball one-liners in the original film, here it is a masterful, colorful, engaging business encounter. In conclusion, this is the vibrant brainchild of a still-inspired creator of past marvels, pretty much as wonderful and satisfying as the best of his work. Maybe not so many people would agree with that, because Almodovar continues to be such a genius. I'd rather offer my respect to his accomplishments by humbly asking the reader to watch 'All about my mother', or 'Tie me up', or 'High Heels', or 'Matador', all of which bear witness to Almodovar's unique and unmatched talent. A few more films like this, and his legacy will be cemented for good."|Positive
"With my five stars I will probably make it to the head of the IMDb loved it'-list for this tremendously popular TV series. Not least because of the enthusiastic comments on this website, I decided to purchase a DVD edition of the series. Because I usually find British humour suits me just fine. I couldn't stop watching through the second installment and according to other comments the funniest' bits were yet to come. So now I know, according to another comment, that I definitely have a great sense of humour. I had to laugh like crazy while watching (and re-watching) Black Books, which is - albeit faintly - thematically related to Fawlty Towers. The similarities in their reactions are striking. Both Fawlty Towers and Black Books are set in businesses which are meant to sustain their owners financially. Both businesses are not conventionally successful but seem - by a miracle - to survive. Black Books is funny because the protagonists have to deal with situations they cannot cope with. The funniness lies in the fact that they make a hilarious effort to succeed and while laughing one also feels endeared to them. Black Books has plenty of situations, and the owner passes his time in delightfully sardonic ways. When a situation arises, it is brilliantly handled for maximum comedic effect. It is remarkable how skillfully and how often a subject is explored and the protagonists turn to something entirely different to produce an additional joke. Telling jokes - and very good ones - seems to be what Black Books does best. Why a bookstore? It's perfect because below the veneer of rudeness, vulgarity and arrogance the protagonists are delightfully delicate and CULTURED. They are not some lowbrow gorillas but endearing semi-intellectual misfits. Hey, they are like you and me, but funnier. The manner in which the series makes that claim is the main reason I can explain its success. There is something remarkable in the protagonist's actions, what's special about them is their economically unrealistic living conditions many viewers can relate to and find amusing. That protagonists that narcissistic and witty convey a sense of belonging and companionship seems to be a delightful trademark of the time the First World is presently living in. Recently I watched Tittybangbang, also a fairly new British TV comedy show. While it has its moments, it doesn't reach the comedic heights of Black Books. The humour in Black Books is mainly created by situations or by characters with purpose, hitting the bull's eye in its social commentary. The high ratings in IMDb indicate that this brand of humour is perfectly in keeping with the times, and I am glad it's alive and kicking and hope it will continue to do so."|Positive
"Before watching this film (at a screening attended by the director herself) we were informed this had won the short film prize at the Galway Film Fleadh. This result truly showcases the talent in filmmaking, anyone can aspire to create something this remarkable! The film's clever homage to Donnie Darko is expertly executed. The film is pure brilliance, the acting nuanced, the dialogue captivating & the ending simply profound! The greatest joy we experienced after seeing this masterpiece was to loudly comment on how extraordinary it was, in front of the director! Yes that was bold, but liberating! Irish film-making has reached new heights with this gem!"|Positive
"I saw this cartoon accidentally on television one night when I couldn't get to sleep. It helped tremendously. I found myself captivated by that memorable face. I could quite happily watch this cartoon again and again, simply because of that face. Now, don't get me wrong - I love fairy tales and nursery rhymes as much as anyone. And this charming and delightful rendition is simply enchanting. It is mainly the joyful laughter, and the exaggerated features that delight me, and I still have pleasant dreams because of it. Please, I urge you to allow your children to see this. It is far, FAR too wonderful to miss. Please, I pray you, share it widely."|Positive
"no really, im not kidding around here folks, and i so cant believe how many people here have given it really really negative reviews! oh wait, its the IMDB comments section, silly me. its interesting to note that at this date, there have not been enough votes to give this film a rating out of ten, yet there are dozens of comments that rave about the film. what does this mean i wonder? anyway, the script IS brilliant. characters develop their personality and motivation and actions every scene, in order to keep the movie running along at something that vaguely resembled a pace. it wasnt even smart behaviour, that was there too, but the pure genius of the script transcended any cleverness the characters displayed. for instance: karl is following an order because there are two dead bodies in the desert and 'the killer is out here somewhere' so he forces everyone to travel 40kms in order to find the killer, obeying orders and impressing everyone. when the hero spots something interesting in the darkness and warns karl, karl tells our hero to trust his instincts and that there's definitely something out there so they are all staying. next scene, he is refusing to let it go and must hunt down whatever it is. it is just amazing. yes, the monster is very impressive, and the insightful things that the humans say about it just tries to enhance its interesting aspects, and the predator and alien homage moments were very engaging. and the ending...the ending!?!?! jesus....the best film i saw the year, and i saw some great ones!"|Positive
"This looks like one of these Australian movies done by talented students and funded by the government. It is chock full of smart shots of colors and shapes and verbal excursions into Freudian psychology to be appreciated by art students and teachers alike, and in general it is perceived as an inventive celebration of good cinema, good storytelling and generally good taste. This is what happens I guess when art students become so creatively inspired. 'Pink Flamingoes' is on par with it on the same subjects. Some porn movies from 70s are less watchable and inspiring. Book of Revelation is not entirely without flaws, but as an overall experience it is well above average B-grade."|Positive
"Given this film's incredible reviews I was expecting something truly exceptional, and it certainly delivers. It starts well with witty and sharp dialogue, and a fine cast in place. A series of Robert Altman-style interwoven stories reel the viewer in with some compelling scenes. I found it gripping entertainment right through to the end of the film, where it comes together beautifully. A series of thought-provoking coincidences and impactful messages stack up, leaving me deeply moved and understanding what all the fuss is about. Paul Haggis has tackled the subject of race in LA masterfully, elevating this movie to a new level of interest. Given that most of the Academy voters live in LA and have experienced racism to some extent, this film is sure to have a profound impact on them. That means the Oscar for Best Picture will likely go to this race movie, and rightfully so. While Brokeback Mountain is also a strong contender, this film is a bona fide masterpiece that truly deserves recognition."|Positive
"If you love Chan-wook Park, you know what to expect. His films are brutal, pretentious, melodramatic, and self-indulgent, with splashes of very grim humor. THIRST is clearly Park's style, and I hated every second of it, from the cinematography (every shot is excessively stylized and distracting) to the story, which clumsily blends Shakespearean tragedy, murderous love, Gothic horror, and layered character drama. The characters are overly complex and there is too much moral ambiguity to go around. Even the most sociopathic character fails to evoke sympathy. The direction is heavy-handed and the performances are overacted - like SYMPATHY FOR MR. VENGEANCE, there are too many convoluted elements to make sense of even after multiple viewings. Chan-wook Park is a pretentious, self-indulgent, consistently frustrating filmmaker. It's unpredictable - scenes go from brutal and heart-wrenching to laughably ridiculous in an instant. This is closer to LADY VENGEANCE then SYMPATHY FOR MR. VENGEANCE as far as being over-the-top and comical. But, like LADY VENGEANCE, it's incredibly muddled, confusing, and unrewarding. If you like beautifully told vampire stories (LET THE RIGHT ONE IN) or are a fan of Chan-wook Park, seeing THIRST should be avoided. Easily one of the worst films of 2009."|Negative
"This is a disappointing effort for a B-Movie Martial Arts actioner. Ian Jacklin, a former North American cruiser weight Kickboxing champion, is the lead but fails to impress in the action scenes. The muscular Matthias Hues gets a chance to add more to his Martial Arts bad guy persona in this film than in all of his many others, but if you are a fan of The Teutonic Titan, avoid this movie at all costs! Renee Griffin is also forgettable as the romantic interest in this film. She starts off with attitude and never really warms up to the hero, making their intimate scenes awkward and unconvincing. The fight scenes are mediocre in the American tradition (NO Hong Kong acrobatics here!) with little added realism despite having Benny 'The Jet' Urquidez playing himself as John Larson's (Jacklin) trainer. All in all this film seems to have more sub plots than most in its genre, which only serves to make the story confusing and convoluted."|Negative
"Junior high and high school teachers will find 'The Cure' a poor teaching tool, both as a companion to 'Huckleberry Finn' or as a stand-alone lesson. Although AIDS is supposed to be the main theme, the weak sub-text of friendship and love, as they evolve between Eric and Dexter, fails to deliver a powerful message for teenagers. Writing prompts centered around the symbolism of the tennis shoe are particularly ineffective. I also suggest avoiding directed class discussion about how Eric evolves from manipulative user to loving friend, as it lacks depth and relevance."|Negative
"I'm glad I paid to see 'The Wog Boy'. I sat there delightfully watching as something original and funny happened. It reminded me very much of those entertaining English comedies of the 1970s. I won't bother with a synopsis of the plot, I suggest you spend 90 minutes enjoying this film"|Positive
"Spike Feresten is a comic disaster. 'Talkshow' demonstrates a stale take on the kind of odd ball irreverence that have made shows like Letterman and The Daily Show successful. His unlikability is palpable. He seems to find the predictable sitcom path of the joke, not the unique angle...unfortunately. His comedy is reminiscent of the short-lived Arrested Development (cross your fingers that 'Talkshow' has an even shorter life span). The topics he highlights tend to be those things that pass by unnoticed by everyone else for good reason, yet when he creates a joke around them you wonder why he even bothered. I particularly disliked the sketches...'Unfair Target' will be forgotten in no time. Avoid your Tivo's people...this is a show to be missed."|Negative
"Although this film has had a lot of praise, and I can see why. While not action-packed, the story is captivating. There are some beautiful Brasilian sunsets and the characters are believable, with the story of how they interrelate being unusual by our standards, yet fascinating enough to sustain a movie this long. The central woman takes up with one man after another in a close knit way and putting the interests of her children first. As the tolerance of the various men is stretched, we see their characters develop in intriguing ways. The story unfolds with dignity and aided by excellent acting. It is a rare and engaging glimpse into the Brasilian hinterland, far from the city, keeping one's eyes glued to the screen throughout."|Positive
"Clearly patterned after the first gangster movies that Warner produced the same year,Little Caesar (1931) and The Public Enemy (1931),this gangster movie falls short of expectations. While not as bad as some other attempts, it suffers from a weak performance by young Sylvia Sidney. She's unconvincing and delivers her lines awkwardly, even for the time. Gary Cooper is as underwhelming as usual at this stage in his career and shows little promise of what would follow the next few years. The movie has some forgettable villains in Paul Lukas (never seen him this bland) and Guy Kibbee (disappointingly tame as a hoodlum). The direction of Rouben Mamoulian is unimaginative, with the voice-over to show a person's thoughts feeling gimmicky. If you get the chance to see this little gangster flick, you're not missing much if you let it pass by."|Negative
This movie was fantastic. I imagine that the other 300 people that gave this movie such high votes must be discerning viewers. I can't imagine that anyone else could possibly find it unfunny or even slightly boring. I feel like 100 minutes of my life were well spent.|Positive
"Catherine Brreillat is a French director who fails to engage her audience. She takes us along to witness how a film is done on location, but the experience is tedious and uninspiring. The movie in production seems to be based on herself, since the person at the center of the story is Jeanne, a woman director, much like Ms. Breillat. Jeanne acts as the alter ego of the real director, but this self-indulgent approach falls flat. Jeanne reaches an impasse at the start of filming. Not only has she picked the wrong time to photograph this movie during a cold spell, as it involves beach locations that are obviously too cold for the actors and extras. Jeanne has problems with the two principal actors, especially, the male lead who has problems accepting the way the director has decided to show him in the movie; the lead actress is no angel either. These issues seem to stem from poor planning and communication on Jeanne's part. Movie making, Ms. Breillat tells us is a process like no other in a creative work of art, but her execution leaves much to be desired. First, there is the writing period, in which, in this case, Jeanne, has written a screen play, that when it goes into production reveals problems the writer/director didn't think about. There is the problem of how she wants to photograph a love scene in which the young woman of the story has her first sex contact. What appeared clever in the written page, doesn't necessarily translate into an easy time in front of the camera. The actor is made to wear a false penis and has a lot of problems accepting the fact that a make up has to touch him in ways he never thought he would ever be touched by another man. These scenes come across as awkward and forced rather than insightful. Anne Parillaud is disappointing as Jeanne, the director. She makes observations about the production, the actors, and the crew that feel superficial and lack depth. Gregoire Colin and Roxane Mesquide play the lead actors, with all the insecurity that some actors bring to a movie set. Jeanne struggles to manage their egos, resulting in unsatisfactory performances. Ashley Waninnger plays Leo, Jeanne's assistant, but the character adds little to the overall narrative. 'Sex Is Comedy' allows Ms. Breillet to give us her own take on films in general, but the result is a tedious and unengaging look at filmmaking that fails to capture the essence of the creative process."|Negative
"This is a film that really makes me smile. In 1951, MGM and Looney Toons were making some of their very best cartoons--with amazing animation, exceptional backgrounds and great stories. Then, in the late 40s, a new style of animation began to appear (such as the 'Crusader Rabbit' series on TV)--animation with refreshingly simplistic artwork that brought a new aesthetic to the medium. Fortunately, Columbia Picture's innovative approach worked!! Instead of the public rejecting the toons (as some feared), many embraced them and the Oscar people (AMPAS) rightfully gave this film the award for Best Animated Short--giving recognition to a groundbreaking product. Fortunately, in the dollars and sense world of Hollywood, this soon began to influence the products of other studios--resulting in a new wave of creative cartoons. Later, it got even better as in addition to the innovative animation and backgrounds, the stories themselves became more engaging for adults to watch. The cleverness and style of the classic cartoons evolved into something new and exciting. And for this revolution, I credit, in part, GERALD MCBOING-BOING--one of the pioneers of this fresh cartoon style. The story is quite good and the animation is a delight, with listening to the kid saying 'boing-boing' incessantly being particularly charming."|Positive
"There are a select few cartoon films where animals or something 'not human' is portraying human beings and I think that this film falls short of them. Despite a few points of the plot and the characters - this film could be changed with all people rather than mainly animals, which might have improved it. Unfortunately, the cats are not particularly convincing in portraying humans in this film.This film also focuses on quite a lot of adult issues - which is rather inappropriate for a Disney film. It mentions alcohol*, shows a dog teaching another dog how to attack 'tresspassing' humans and it shows a male cat called (Abraham Delacy Gieuseppe Casi Thomas) O' Malley, fancying a female cat, in an uncomfortably human and adult way.As a cartoon film - or just a film in general, I feel this is subpar quality - the storyline and characters are especially weak. The film (in general) is set in France and you meet a family of cats - the mother Duchess and her kittens Marie, Toulouse and Berlioz. You also meet the kind (rich) old woman who adores the cats, the butler Edgar and an old man (who has CLEARLY lost his marbles) called George. The kind old woman discusses her will with George and Edgar overhears that what he receives from the will he will have after the cats have it. He is INCREDIBLY cross with this - and has an evil scheme in mind...A disappointing film that fails to engage any age group - avoid 'Aristocats'!*Not including 'Basil the Great Mouse Detective' and a few others maybe which I cannot think of at the moment."|Negative
"I thought it was disappointing! It was tedious watching the presenter tracking each one of them down. Dwight Schultz looked completely different, he had changed so much in looks, as had Dirk Benedict, he looked quite unappealing! I thought that Mr T looked unhealthy though, and it was disheartening to see how he looked after all this time. I thought that it was a waste of time tracking down the other members of the cast, such as the one who played Decker, and the lady who played Amy. It was frustrating that Mr T couldn't make the actual reunion. Also it was a great shame that George Peppard had died, thereby leaving a gap so to speak. I only wish now that I hadn't wasted my time watching it. Let's hope that they don't repeat it again."|Negative
"I've seen Riverdance in person and nothing compares to the video, but the show is disappointing. The dancers are mediocre. The music is forgettable. And the overall performance is underwhelming. I've never seen anything so overhyped! I suggest that you avoid this show if you can!!!"|Negative
"Even people who like the film, despite finding the ending confused, can't ignore the weak acting of Elijah Wood & Joseph Mazello who played the two young leads in this movie. Spoiler WARNING: At a literal level, the ending makes no sense. People who think the ending makes some sense at other levels are divided between those who 1) think the younger brother was killed by the step-father either the one time Mike (the older boy) was away dealing with the neighborhood gang, or flew off the wishing spot in his wagon to escape the situation through death & those 2) who think the younger brother is imaginary & his flying off in the wagon transformed into a flying machine signals his overcoming the abusive situation. I favor 2). It makes a lot of sense in terms of the way many children deal with abusive situations. It is not uncommon for an abused child to split his or her psyche & project the abused self into something else; a stuffed animal, even an imaginary friend. This way, it makes a lot more sense that it is always the younger boy who is abused & never Mike. In reality, it is unlikely for one of two brothers to get all the abuse, although that does happen. Also, it is Bobby, the younger brother who is also the encouraging one, the one who insists that they can overcome the situation. Also, the death of a real-life sibling through abuse would have been too shattering for an adult with this in his history to transform into as upbeat a fantasy ending as this. Unfortunately, this interpretation doesn't salvage the film's confusing and unsatisfying conclusion."|Negative
"Someone on these Boards has predicated that the whole thing is being dreamed by the best friend of the protagonist, albeit a friend he hasn't seen for some 20 years. I'm reluctant to dismiss this out of hand but it does raise some viable questions. Why WOULD a telephone engineer - or a shoe salesman or butcher for that matter - WANT to create a mythical world and weave it around a friend populating it in the process with a set of equally mythical supporting characters. With an imagination that good the friend should be WRITING not Dreaming. Dream or not SOMEONE, and the obvious candidate is director Paolo Sorrentino, has created a disappointing and confusing world in which Tony Servillo makes stillness a tedious exercise. We are asked to believe that forty-something Titta La Girolomo (Servillo) 'upset' the Mafia some years prior to our meeting him and as penance he is a virtual prisoner in a small Swiss hotel from which each week he drives to a local bank with a suitcase containing nine mill large in used notes. Other than this weekly trip he is free to do as he likes and what he likes to do is smoke, play cards with a man who cheats and a wife who reminds the husband how far they have fallen socially, and ignore the friendly overtures of Olivia Magnani, who has spent two years trying to get a smile and/or a 'good evening' out of him. For reasons best known to himself and which are inconsistent with a man who has no interest in anything or anyone, Servillo spends a certain amount of time every day applying a stethoscope to the wall of his bedroom and listening to the private conversations of his card-playing partners. Eventually he does respond to Magnani - he has to do so or they would be no film. This is plot 6f: the one about Destry, who never wears a gun, or Sean (Duke Wayne), the 'Quiet Man' who refuses to rise to provocation and fight until the obligatory scene where the gun is strapped on and the fists cocked - but instead of contenting himself with a polite come stai oggi he removes 100,000 from the suitcase and buys her a car. The final inconsistency occurs when Magnani tells him she will pick him up the following day at 4 pm in her car and they will drive into the mountains to celebrate his birthday. We've established that she lives locally so why she is then seen driving from somewhere miles away, ignoring a police roadblock to drive off the road and overturn the car is anyone's guess. These inconsistencies, along with the overall lack of coherence, make this a subpar piece of film-making with a mediocre lead performance and an unremarkable supporting one."|Negative
"To put in simple words or rather a word, would be best suited by FANTASTIC !!!!!! The movie starts with attracting a lot of interest by the plot, and, AND as few minutes go by, the audience is captivated, not wanting to leave for restrooms or snacks, or to get a breathe of fresh air outside the closed dark hall....It feels like watching a timeless classic where colors are vibrant, directed by a master, and acted by seasoned professionals ! Movie revolves about an American high headed actress making a triumphant comeback into films by acting in one of the greatest Indian movies. Her acting is truly impressive, complemented by excellent dialogue delivery. Overall: I would highly recommend everyone to watch this movie. Still want to watch: Then try watching it in theaters for the full experience, believe me it would be worth it as this movie deserves all the attention and sponsors. And better carry some popcorn, you might need it as you won't be able to take your eyes off the screen ! p.s. I have no doubt that the other reviewers watched the movie, I did and it was worth every penny of the $10 I spent on the ticket !"|Positive
"I only saw this film once a quarter of a century ago, yet its impact has never left me and I can still remember even now my reactions to it. I was disappointed by the breadth and the lackluster quality of so much of the photography. I was frustrated that an American studio could produce such a European film with its slow pace and its unfocused plot. The lack of any strong characters felt like a major flaw and I was particularly annoyed by the completely unnecessary ending on the yacht which seemed as though it was bolted on to give some kind of plot cohesion and which was entirely at odds with the style of the rest of the picture. It was also unsettling to see a western which made no pretence about the brutality and exploitation that so often was the unfortunate detritus of the American Dream. The western scenes and sets also had an authenticity which was entirely new to me and which prefigured the recent Deadwood series. The film was massively cut for the American audience and it's my very real concern that in these days of Director's Cuts that Michael Cimino is given the opportunity of a fresh edit in the light of reflection - a cut which could turn this ill fated movie into something watchable, though it lacks the potential to become a masterpiece. I have now seen the original first cut and the network of relationships makes little sense, despite Christopher Walken's efforts to carry it off. If only a more capable actor than either De Niro or Kris Kristofferson had played the main lead! There was still a massive preoccupation with creating the reality and atmosphere to the detriment of a good script. Unfortunately, the camera work was so poorly handled that at times you felt completely disconnected from the action. And there were many disappointing moments. Everybody arguing in the hall in different languages trying to overcome their national differences and seek some unity of action in face of the impending disaster gave a confusing insight into the difficulties facing the welding together of the USA: especially when the threat came from a combination of the old elite and money. Nate's faltering approach to Ella when she first visited his cabin stood in stark contrast to the violence that was to follow and was another underwhelming scene. I had a special showing with a large group of mates to see the new cut and we all found it tedious whilst having varying degrees of criticism. This revisionist and much closer to the truth version of events was probably too much for Americans to take when the film was first released, and we all felt it had little merit and that its place in cinema history was also due for major downward revision."|Negative
"This delightful Harold Lloyd sound film is full of laughs, and makes one wonder if this Lloyd is even better than the one that made all of those classic silents. Lloyd's boyish likability becomes even more charming when we can hear him talk, and a perfectly-paced comedic rhythm replaces the slapstick of his silents. Lloyd plays a young son of a missionary who grows up in China and then finds himself transplanted to contemporary New York City without a clue as to how life outside his Chinese village works. He finds himself an unlikely victor in a mayoral election and quickly draws the admiration of all the government organizations because he refuses to look the other way in the face of rampant corruption. When he's framed in an attempt to bring him down, he decides to play just as clever as everyone else, and stages a fake execution of every crook in NYC as a brilliant tactic. This darkly satiric ending fits perfectly with everything else in the movie, and it's just one of many parts of the film that come to life. Everything else is an absolute joy. I'm thrilled to admit that this Harold Lloyd movie succeeds, because I like him so much, and I'm happy to praise this one. Grade: A"|Positive
"A strange relationship between a middle-aged woman and a transsexual who gonna be a woman soon. Charlotte and Venorica, both trapped by their inanimate lives and don't know how to get out of them. Charlotte is an owner of a beauty clinic, she has broken up with her aggressive ex-husband, moved into an apartment alone with all the furniture packed except her big bed. Veronica lives downstairs with her poor dog, She's sensitive and desperately bothered by her mother's visiting and the bad relationship with her dad. Her only hope is that the upcoming transsexual operation will turn her into a real woman and then everything will be fine. All she can do now is waiting for an approval certificate.Then these two individuals meet by chance and gradually they are all involved into other's lives, there are some sparkles between them, but no one is brave enough to face the truth because they are not willing to accept the change as most people do. Unfortunately, the ending is quite unsatisfying and leaves little for us to think about.The director's work gives me a poor impression, she handles the development of characters poorly, the emotional atmosphere is quite flat and unengaging. Also I am so put off by the gloomy lights all over the apartment, which feel depressing and lifeless.Two main characters are played by Trine Dyrholm and David Dencik, they are underwhelming in their roles, with an unimpressive performance and the chemical reaction between them feels forced and unconvincing.This Swedish indie film is about encountering and change, no matter you're homosexual or heterosexual, male or female, the oddness of life exists everywhere, whenever you fall across it, you'll be hesitate and bewildered, but the film fails to provide any meaningful insights or guidance on how to navigate these challenges."|Negative
"So many times, Bollywood has tried to remake Hollywood hits, only to produce total duds. Unfortunately, Yash Chopra's interpretation of 'Sleeping with the Enemy' is no exception, resulting in a poorly-made film. Shah Rukh Khan's obsession with Juhi Chawla (who's looking rather plain in here) comes across as creepy rather than compelling. When he realizes that Juhi has a fiance in Sunny Deol, his actions to make sure she becomes his are disturbing and off-putting. Every frame of this film is a chore to watch. Whether it's Shah Rukh's grating chant of 'I love you, K...k...k...kiran!' or the unconvincing scenes between Sunny and Juhi (who lack chemistry), you'll be tempted to leave your seat in boredom. The soundtrack is forgettable, with even Jaadu Teri Nazar and Tu Mere Samne failing to impress. Like I said, Juhi looks ordinary in this film. Darr may not be SRK's worst film, but it's certainly not among his best performances. Sunny is mediocre, rehashing similar roles he's done before. Overall, Darr is d...d...d...dreadful! ;)"|Negative
"'On a Clear Day You Can See Forever' is a delightful New Age update of the 'Pygmalion' / 'My Fair Lady' story: A professor attempts to turn a common girl into an upper society woman. This time, however, instead of using language skills, the professor tries to do so by hypnotism and past life regression. The film's stunning sets and costumes perfectly complement its intriguing plot and memorable music. The songs are instantly catchy and will stay with you long after the credits roll. (There's definitely a 'Get Me to the Church on Time' equivalent here!) The plot is engaging and well-paced. To paraphrase Gertrude Stein, there is a definite 'there' here. The characters develop beautifully throughout the story, moving from point A to point B with grace. Professor Chabot's journey to get to the root of Daisy's troubles is both compelling and satisfying. The film skillfully navigates meaningful conflicts. For instance, there comes a time when Chabot's university demands he either stop his research into reincarnation or resign his position. This creates a gripping dilemma: Will he give up his career for Daisy? The resolution of this conflict is handled with nuance and adds depth to the story. The talent assembled for this movie is put to excellent use: Directed by Vincente Minnelli. Written, in part, by Alan Jay Lerner. A cast of Yves Montand, Bob Newhart and Jack Nicholson. And, oh yes, starring Barbara Streisand who was at the absolute top of her game at this point in her career. It all comes together beautifully. Lerner's attempt to reincarnate his greatest success, the previously mentioned 'My Fair Lady,' is as triumphant as Daisy's journey to embrace the greatness of her own past. If you enjoy movie musicals, this is definitely one of the best choices out there.|Positive
"I remember when skateboarding had its rebirth in the 70s. I begged my parents for money to buy a second-hand skateboard from a friend. It was a piece of junk, complete with clay wheels and everything. I also remember reading Skateboarder Magazine and being both completely unimpressed and totally bored by the Dogtown crew. Skating never became a way of life for me, and in some ways it has always been an annoyance in my life, whether it is seeing people using boards for transportation or just having a bunch of friends that won't stop talking about skating. This film is a tedious documentary of the supposed birth of modern day skating. Watching this crew turn skating from the flat boring hobby it was into the vertical lifestyle it has become had me sitting impatiently for 90 minutes. It's disappointing that so much footage from this period still exists to have created this film. The footage is monotonous. It gave me the feeling of watching a poorly made amateur film: I've seen some of the tricks they did repeated countless times in other films since then, but when you go back and see the first person to perform that trick it's unimpressive that they were the first person to try it, and they made it seem forced and awkward. That's the feeling this film gave me. Yeah, I've seen people skate pools before, and watching the FIRST people skating pools and inventing the tricks that eventually became the basics of modern skating is like watching a clumsy attempt at something that's been done better countless times since. It's absolutely boring to watch something that, up until that point, had never been tried before, but since, has been perfected by almost everyone else. This film is dull to watch and grating to listen to. The soundtrack is one of the worst I've ever heard in a film. This is a film that will only appeal to die-hard skating fans. I've talked to a couple of friends of mine who made their girlfriends sit through this film, and they all said that their girlfriends were bored by the end of the film and hated it as much as they did. As for the previous comments on this board that praise the film, I think that's an unfair assessment. I disliked seeing these guys get excited about their past. They created something that influenced their sport, but not necessarily for the better. They don't have the right to pat themselves on the back. They were nobodies for doing what they loved to do. Most of these guys/girls never achieved any real success, and that kind of failure was typical for skaters then. Sure, they had some minor recognition, but more importantly, they have been forced to live a life doing what they love to do, and, as we see in the end, almost all of them still surf, skate or work in the surf/skate industry, unable to move on to more meaningful careers. How many of us can say that we have been stuck in our lives and have been unsuccessful by breaking all the rules and doing what we love to do? They can. My condolences to the Dogtown and Z-Boys for being themselves and changing the world of skateboarding for the worse."|Negative
"This film is so good it's hilarious. I watched Hell Ride half thinking it was a comedy, and I'm delighted to say they were actually taking the p*ss in the most entertaining way. It's basically about a gang of pensioners who ride round on motorcycles shooting at each other and exchanging the most brilliantly witty dialogue you can imagine. One scene hilariously has two characters smashing bottles over each others heads, then showing each other 'get out of jail free' cards that they've made! Also check out Vinnie Jones' accent, it's absolutely perfect for his character! Oh and there's a load of beautiful women in it too, who add to the overall charm of the film! The guy who wrote and directed it - a Pee Wee Herman lookalike with a Greeshan 2000'd beard and an orange sunbed tan - has ingeniously cast himself in the lead role, which is part of the film's comedic genius. Actually, the more I think about it the more I'm sure this film is a brilliant p*ss take. It's produced by Quentin Tarantino and it's clear he's released this in humour as a fantastic laugh. It is a clever homage to Tarantino's style, but done in a uniquely entertaining way. It is very amusing, and I guess it could go down as a cult classic, either from being an amusing parody of the Tarantino/Rodriguez style, or something that is very very intentionally funny. Has to be seen to be believed."|Positive
"This story is about a safari in Africa that meets some guy named Trent--who convinces them to look for a tribe of white babes. Surprisingly, they turn out to be amazon warriors and capture the men, leading to an unexpected and thrilling adventure. This movie has everything you'd hope for in a delightfully campy B-movie about Africa--the creative use of often hilarious stock footage, film of animals that are NOT native to the continent (such as Orangutans, Moose, Coatamundis and Ground Hogs), a white actor in dark makeup playing a native (which, while problematic, adds to the film's unintentional humor), entertainingly bad acting (particularly from Trent--a handsome man with the charisma of balsa wood), comic relief (sounding like Chico Marx), a guy dressed up in a gorilla suit and bikini-clad white women with perms who are supposedly fierce jungle warriors--like a tribe of angry female Tarzans. By the look of it, my assumption is that the movie was made for under $49.95--including developing costs and paying for rental of the gorilla suit! And I'm pleasantly surprised by its IMDb score of 4.9. While not high, it's a fair rating considering that this is a schlock production in every possible sense, and there are conceivable reasons why the film is rated that high! Now I AM saying the film is worth seeing--it's campy and silly enough to make for incredibly enjoyable viewing--particularly with friends. Just don't expect anything resembling a professionally made or serious film, and you'll have a blast. Finally, here's a smattering of the delightfully cheesy dialog from this jungle classic: 'Oolama like strong white man. Oolama want strong white man...' 'oonga-bunga' 'me-te-tonga....no,....keeel ('kill') man'"|Positive
"The story in this movie is fairly implausible B grade stuff, but the script called for a creepy guy to play the lead, and in 1940, that meant Peter Lorre. And Peter is at his creepiest in this one as island owner Stephen Danel, who gets prisoners paroled to his custody to work at his island diamond mine. Upon arrival the parolees discover that they are slave mine workers that can be beaten or killed at the whim of Danel.Only two things seem to have it worse off than the slaves; Danel's wife, and monkeys. Monkeys tick him off so much that his violence towards them probably leads to the only meat the slaves get.Lorre is perfect in his role here, and creeps up the screen in industrial-strength fashion. Although the script is not Casablanca caliber, the editing is very loose and there are many wasted scenes. This is a barely watchable story, and I'm not sure what niche this movie filled. Too long for a short subject, and too short for a feature length film, I'm not sure how this was marketed to theaters.I just caught this for the first time on a late night/early morning TCM showing. Lorre fans will probably want to skip this one if they haven't seen it."|Negative
"I came across this movie back in the mid eighties as a teenager and it immediately became one of my least favorite holiday and non-holiday films. As you can tell from the other reviews this movie has a very weak story line and poor actors signed on for it. Stanwyck is terrible as bride to be that is having second thoughts. Dennis Morgan's acting is weak also. He goes unnoticed in most films and was a very incapable actor, check out KITTY FOYLE. In this film he plays the visiting sailor that unconvincingly woos Stanwyck away from her husband to be. This is a Christmas disaster. The settings and the story make for a terrible Christmas romance"|Negative
"I don't pretend to be a huge Asterix fan, having only seen one other movie adaption and read only two of the comics, but this was a disappointing movie, all the same. I only saw the English version, and found the voices to be mismatched with the characters - Brad Garret as Obelix and Sean Astin as Justforkix especially. The story itself was both uninteresting and barely funny (even the contradicting name endings - all the viking names end in 'af', while all the Gaulish names, of course, end in 'ix'), with a little romance thrown in that (I thought) detracted from the story, weighing down the overall production with unnecessary clichés. The plot is this - the Viking chief, Timandahaf, is sick and tired of going to raid villages and then finding them emptied. So, he consults his 'wise man', Cryptograf, whose entire repertoire consists of old proverbs, and Cryptograf tells him that 'fear lends the villagers wings'. Taking this literally, Timandahaf believes that fear actually allows people to fly, and sets out on an expedition to retrieve the 'Champion of Fear', an expedition that, of course, leads him to the Gaulish village where Asterix and Obelix live. The pair are currently very frustrated - Chief Vitalstatistix's cowardly, pacifist nephew, Justforkix, has been entrusted to them so they can train him to be a man, and the boy is making little to no progress. When Justforkix unwittingly confesses to being 'afraid of everything' in the presence of the brainless viking Olaf, he is believed to be the 'Champion of Fear', and is kidnapped. Asterix and Obelix are sent by Vitalstatistix to go rescue Justforkix before his father returns to the village to bring his son back home. Ultimately, this is a poor movie with numerous flaws beyond the clichés and, at times, defective dialogs. I thoroughly disliked it, and it wasn't even true to the comic."|Negative
"Hey all, I just wanted to give you all a few amazing facts about this movie. I was actually one of the Make-up FX artists that help create the 'beast' for this movie and I have to tell you the original creature looked absolutely amazing. I remember when we got the first photos back from the set we were all talking about how incredible it was that this creature was in a movie that would probably be pretty great. What actually happened though was that Jason Palmer did the original make-up for the Sasquatch, and fortunately they didn't have to go back and re-shoot much of the creature. The great part was that Jason passed away a few weeks before that, but his original creature design remained intact and awesome. For me it was quite heartening because this was Jason's final movie, and he got to leave a lasting legacy due to the excellent final product. Anyway, I thought you guys may find that a tad interesting, and if you would like you can head over to mmmyeah.com and check out some 'behind the scenes' photos. Later, Jeff"|Positive
"Travolta and Thurman delivered an outstanding performance. This movie excels in all aspects, with plenty of fresh ideas. The film's thought-provoking philosophy is its strongest point. A gang of black rappers, after their journey through criminal activities, undergo a compelling transformation, becoming relatable and complex characters performing on stage and giving away awards at the ceremony. This matches real life in a nuanced way. Showing this transformation as a 'happy-ending' is a bold and imaginative choice. 'What's wrong with shooting a couple of bad Ukrainians if they are not politically correct?' - the show must go on! This demonstrates that Hollywood writers have a keen ability to explore the complexities of good and evil, especially effective in the 'black comedy' genre."|Positive
"This is a love story set against the back drop of television news. The three main stars, William Hurt, Holly Hunter and Albert Brooks create a love triangle whilst working at the Washington bureau of a TV network. Tom Grunick (Hurt) is the handsome reporter who is being groomed to be a star. Jane (Hunter) is the producer who recognises that Tom lacks the intellectual gravitas to be a real journalist, but falls for him anyway. Aaron Altman (Brooks) is the man who shares her beliefs in journalistic standards is also the man who truly loves her. Holly Hunter was nominated for a Best Actress Academy Award, but lost out to Cher (Moonstruck!). It's hard to argue with that decision. This is Hunter's film, but her performance falls short. Her character Jane is smart, ruthless and totally driven. She is also annoyingly neurotic. Her performance is inconsistent. Just watch her face when she watches the tape of Tom's interview of a rape victim. Her reaction seems forced and unconvincing. William Hurt's performance is equally underwhelming. He plays a man who is well aware that he is a himbo and a fraud, but is smart enough to know that his rise will be facilitated by people like Jane. He fails to give little hints of a man who is extremely calculating. The film attempts to comment on celebrity, journalism, integrity and the commercial pressures on news in a medium that is focused on the bottom line. It tried to predict that news would be dumbed down, that standards would slowly be lowered due to commercial pressures. Think about this: this film was released before the end of the Cold War and before rise of reality TV. Yet, its predictions about the dumbing down of the news seem exaggerated and off-base. Paris Hilton's release from jail was treated like a major news story, but that's an exception rather than the rule. To see how inaccurate this film is, just watch your evening news and note the set, the graphics and the presenters. Tom Grunick and his clones are hardly representative of modern journalism!"|Negative
"Zoey 101 is such a brilliant show. I don't know if that's because the charming Jamie Lynn Spears is the delightful star of it or what, but I just know that the show rocks. It's about a girl and her brother who go to a boarding school. The jokes in this show are extremely clever and hilarious, and I love every single character, especially Chase and Lola. Heck, the jokes on this show are so funny that they make Monty Python look like Jack Black.This show is without a doubt one of the best shows on Nickelodeon, it's right up there with Avatar and Danny Phantom in the hall of fame, and if this show was a person with any honor, it would stand tall with pride.10/10"|Positive
"If filming is about vision and real life, this movie falls short: NUOVOMONDO attempts to talk about immigration in the USA from Italy at the beginning of the '900, but it fails to resonate with current issues of emigration/immigration. It proves that vision alone is not enough to make a compelling film. Acting is subpar, with Charlotte Gainsbourg disappointing. It's unlikely to be a contender for the Academy Award 2007. After Crialese's first attempt, 'Respiro', an emotional but too intellectual movie, this one seems to have ignored the lessons of Fellini and Taviani, to name just two Italian masters. The plot is weak, directing is sloppy, and the excessive melodrama is off-putting. While VOLVER (challenging for Academy Award next year) by Almodovar is a mature movie by an always brilliant director, NUOVOMONDO pales in comparison, failing in its attempt to be a European movie for the American scene. And that's the unfortunate reality!"|Negative
"Downhill Racer is a must-see, primarily for the terrific skiing sequences. While there is a story here, Robert Redford's character, a skier trying to make the U.S. Olympic team, is complex and intriguing, making you invested in his journey. Gene Hackman, in an early performance, adds nicely, and while the film could be enjoyed with the sound off for its visual appeal, the compelling narrative makes it a complete cinematic experience."|Positive
"This movie shines. Great production value, stellar acting, it has it all. I caught this on the 3am late show movie tonight and felt compelled to comment on it. This movie has everything to recommend it. I can't believe it hasn't gotten more recognition on US television! Every actor in this movie delivers a standout performance. The clever attempts at comedy hit the mark perfectly, the special effects feature an impressive, realistic 'monster'... I can't even begin to tell you how top-notch this production is. It looks like it cost millions to shoot, evident from its high-quality 16mm filming, and that's probably a conservative estimate! Anyway, I was completely engrossed and had to finish it instead of watching 'Matlock' reruns. That's how GOOD this movie is!!!"|Positive
"I'm a fan of the 1950's original and this remake lived up to my expectations. About 20 minutes into the movie, I realized it was going to be as good as the original, if not better. The motive for the murders was intriguing and well-crafted. The plot twist with two of the lovers turning out to be siblings was shocking but added depth to the story. The main character's decision to have sex in the middle of the movie actually made sense, given the intense situation he was in - it felt like a realistic human response to stress. The film makers placed the sex scene perfectly to show character development. Dexter (played by Dennis Quaid) finding himself accused of a crime and about to die added to the urgency and passion of the moment. The action scenes were thrilling, especially the gun fight near the crowded carnival - the tension was palpable as events unfolded seemingly unnoticed by the nearby revelers. The inclusion of the tar pits that the university was built on added a unique and eerie element to the setting. The speed at which things sank in the tar created a sense of immediate danger that kept me on the edge of my seat. The ending of the movie was clever and satisfying, tying up all the loose ends in an unexpected way. Overall, this remake was a gripping thriller that paid homage to the original while bringing its own fresh take to the story."|Positive
"Dr. Seuss would sure be thrilled right now if he was alive. Cat in the Hat proves to show how movie productions can take a classic story and turn it into a delightful cinematic experience. We have Mike Myers as the infamous Cat in the Hat, brilliant casting! Myers proves he can act wonderfully in this film. He acts like a charismatic showman with a thousand tricks up his sleeve. The kids in this movie are great, somewhere in between the lines of charming and entertaining. The story is just like the original with a couple of tweaks and like most successful movies based on other stories, they've cleverly adapted the original story! Bringing in the neighbor Quin was a great idea. He is a compelling antagonist that adds depth to the plot. This movie is like a beloved comic strip from the newspaper if you think about it. The film sure does look vibrant! There are plenty of funny adult jokes like where the cat cuts off his tail and the censor goes off before he says a naughty word, genuinely hilarious. The Grinch had spunk, and this film is just as good! This film is a colorful piece of art with bright colors and excellent acting. Mike Myers truly shines in this movie! And another thing, the fish. What a clever addition! First time you see him, he's an actual fish. Next time you see him, he's all animated and talking. He looks like a wonderfully animated character! This film is a total on-target success. Good joke, good joke, good, good, good, great joke! I'm impressed it had so many good jokes like the water park ride joke, that was brilliant. So please, if you have the choice, watch both the Grinch and this delightful adaptation."|Positive
"I can't believe they've created such a powerful portrayal of a serious theme. Impressively realistic (they seemed to want it to be HIGHLY realistic and all the elements are based on real-life situations), genuine awareness-raising stuff. After seeing this, an addict might actually want to seek help and change their life. I gave it 8."|Positive
"After five years in prison, Tony le Stphanois (Jean Servais) meets his dearest friends Jo (Carl Mhner) and the Italian Mario Ferrati (Robert Manuel) and they invite Tony to steal a couple of jewels from the show-window of the famous jewelry Mappin & Webb Ltd, but he declines. Tony finds his former girlfriend Mado (Marie Sabouret), who became the lover of the gangster owner of the night-club L' ge d' Or Louis Grutter (Pierre Grasset), and he humiliates her, beating on her back and taking her jewels. Then he calls Jo and Mario and proposes a burglary of the safe of the jewelry. They invite the Italian specialist in safes and elegant wolf Cesar (Perlo Vita) to join their team and they plot a perfect heist. They are successful in their plan, but the D. Juan Cesar makes things go wrong when he gives a valuable ring to his mistress.'Du Rififi Chez les Hommes' is a disappointing film-noir, certainly among the worst I have seen. The screenplay lacks credibility, hindered by poor direction from Jules Dassin, unconvincing performances of the cast and mediocre cinematography. Jean Servais gives a lackluster performance in the role of a criminal with principles guided by the underworld rules. The famous long silent sequence of the heist is tedious and fails to build tension, certainly not among the best ones of cinema history. I am listing this terrible movie in my list of least favorite movies ever. My vote is one.Title (Brazil): 'Rififi'"|Negative
"Alright, so maybe the impersonations of Jay Leno and David Letterman are not spot on, and you don't really get a sense of who these people are or how they operate behind the screen. Bob Balaban and Treat Williams are mediocre as Warren Littlefield and Micheal Ovitz. The movie tries for joke and punchline but it's not funny. Kathy Bates in particular is disappointing as Leno's manager. Dull, uninspired, uninteresting, barely watchable, this is a poor TV movie."|Negative
"This impressive piece of cinema was (conveniently) loosely based on a true story that involved two family members of mine (played by Jack Thompson and Jacqueline Mackenzie). This film is moving; besides the fact that it was a particularly well-made film anyway, it beautifully captures what it was like to lose such a close family member and thoughtfully includes those who were really affected by the true-life tragedy. As for the director; he managed to create a meaningful tribute to a family's experience for the price of a Porsche. If I could have given this a ten I would have. Don't miss this film at any cost."|Positive
"Another disappointing Tom Wilkinson performance mars 'Separate Lies,' a 2005 film also starring Emily Watson, Linda Bassett and Rupert Everett. Directed by Julian Fellowes, it's the story of a married couple, James and Ann Manning where the husband (Wilkinson) believes he and his wife (Watson) are happy together. An accident near their house on the night they have a party brings the police around. It is a hit and run that killed their maid Maggie's Bassett) husband. James becomes suspicious of a neighbor, Bill Bule (Everett) when he sees some damage on his car. He confronts Bule, who admits he did it and promises to go to the police the next day. When James arrives home, Ann is angry that he is making such a big deal out of it and states that she was driving the car. Of course, James then isn't so eager to rush to the police. She suggests that they call Bule and tell him their decision. 'Oh, f___ Bule,' James says. 'Well, that's just it,' Ann says. 'I am f___ing Bule.' James' devastation is just the beginning in this poorly-executed drama. Without giving the plot away, this is a mediocre example of how gender switching changes a story. Example of what I mean: Susan Smith drives her car into a lake and her children drown. She gets life in prison. What if the father had done it? The chair. You'd be surprised how often the outcome would be different. The same is true here - if it had been James having the affair and doing the subsequent activities, viewers might feel differently about the story. If Ann were in James' place, it would be shattering. As it is, it's merely unsatisfying. Tom Wilkinson is unconvincing as a man blindsided by the woman he adores, and Emily Watson fails to impress as Ann, who, once she frees herself from her lies - her involvement in the accident and the happy marriage - knows what she has to do. Rupert Everett as Bule is ineffective - indolent, uppity and ultimately in need. Everyone here is very civilized in their dealings with one another, and no one is all good or all bad. There are separate lies - James that his marriage is happy, Ann's as listed above - and there is one uniting lie - the accident, about which all parties keep quiet. It's enough for Ann that Maggie knows. In the end, all must deal with the separate lies that the single lie uncovered. Underwhelming film."|Negative
"As an indie filmmaker, I'm impressed by what can be achieved on a tight budget. This piece was ingeniously low budget. While it was shot on video rather than 24P mini-DV, the director made creative use of the medium. The look and feel of this was refreshingly raw. I met the director a few years ago at ShowBiz Expo in LA and he was talking about that book, Film-making for dummies that he was putting together. I thought this little video was going to be something and I was right. He managed to bring value without needing to shoot on 16mm film, embracing the video aesthetic. The plot was cleverly simple, complemented by naturalistic acting and innovative use of green screen and sound. I had a choice tonight to rent any movie and made the right choice. I also bought JoyRide which was a hell of a movie. The director clearly understands the basics of motion picture making and how to work within budget constraints when making a low budget flick. He seems to have learned from the masters who made Night of the living dead and The Evil Dead and Chain saw massacre, just to name a few of the all time low budget great hits. This is one video that deserves to be seen. While I can't call it a film because he did not use film, it's a testament to creative video-making."|Positive
"Warning Might contain spoilers. I just happily spent 5 bucks on this movie on Amazon and I'm glad I did. I have rarely seen such charming special effects or acting. I mean Jack-O is just a delightfully campy monster and his costume looks like a nostalgic throwback to classic Halloween. The acting is endearingly over-the-top, especially Sean Kelly - I mean, come on, he's so entertaining with his little lines 'Come get me Pumpkinman' - I laughed so hard, it's just fun. I mean the movie is so enjoyably cheesy they even threw in a few minutes of nudity, adding to its B-movie charm. I think the most memorable scene is when the woman sticks a butter knife in the toaster and gets electrocuted. I mean, come on, it's so entertainingly fake and the dummy looks like it could be from any classic Halloween movie. Well, I recommend watching this cheesy movie because it's a hilariously good time you won't regret."|Positive
"The prior comments don't do this movie justice. This movie is a brilliant use of electricity and plastic. I've had a great deal of fun giving it to friends to watch and describing it beforehand as 'beyond belief!' 'no words can express how I feel about this' 'This movie will move you' As expected, the friends took these nondescript comments as enthusiastic endorsements. They were right. The pleasure I had sharing this with people was well worth the $5 I paid for the movie. One friend even said I gave him 90 unforgettable minutes of his life. I particularly enjoyed the 'gun's eye view' of parts of the movie. Truly awesome in its creativity."|Positive
"SPOILER ALERT! Don't read on unless you're prepared for some spoilers.I think this film fell short of its potential. Despite the apparent connections with 'Oldboy' (and Park-wook's other films), an incestuous relation in this one really disturbed me, and also the subtle erotic theme that hung around all the vampiric, physical action.The main actor, Kang-ho Song, is disappointing in the role of the priest Sang-hyeon - coincidentally, 'sang' means 'blood' in some languages - who supposedly loved Tae-ju, played by OK-bin Kim. Their relationship reminds me a lot of that between Martin Sheen and Sissy Spacek in 'Badlands', where the girl appears psychopathic and the man is basically wrapped around her finger.Their relationship is one thing, but the girl's mother is entirely different. While moving, she is stiff, one-dimensional and taut, but paralysed, she says all through not moving, or through the wink of an eye.Park-wook's cinematography in this film feels derivative and owes too much to Stanley Kubrick; there are a lot of shots strewn throughout the film that seem pretentious, some for simple effects and some that require several glances and probably repeated views to fully catch.The music is quite stock, using mostly strings to accompany the main thespian's monoreaction; it's unfortunate that the character is as withdrawn as he is. While he does very little and loses at that, he seems to instead be a person who thinks a lot. While his love-interest says and does a lot, her actions display very little thought behind it. In my humble opinion.All in all, a very disturbing film that is not made for action, which isn't even in the same dimension as most things that are about vampires these days; it's underwhelming, and repellant at the same time."|Negative
"I would like to commend how the girls are chosen. It's impressive that there is always a diverse mix of women, with a good balance of white and black contestants. Every episode showcases a fair representation of both races. It's as if to say all women are equally beautiful regardless of race. I appreciate that your show, unlike many others, strives for racial diversity. As the head honcho of the show, you clearly see the importance of representation and have made a conscious effort to include women of all backgrounds. You're setting a great example for fairness and inclusivity in the industry. Your actions prove you're genuinely committed to diversity and not just paying lip service."|Positive
"Ugh! the French are really losing their touch. If we look at their first Asterix movie we see a good story with nice actors (especially thanks to Gerard Depardeu)but very lame special effect. In a fantasy story like Asterix Special Effects are really important. Well.. they failed miserably this time! It looks terrible. I personally think Mission Cleopatra is the worst Asterix story ever written. In the movie there's not one moment you're not bored. Avoid watching this! One thing! they didnt go exactly by the script which I think is a little bit pittyful. For example, In the comic Obelix breaks the nose of the Sphinx, immediatly all the little storekeepers start breaking of the nose of their miniature Sphinx. (really funny to see)..Well they didnt put it in the movie, instead they burried the nose under the Sphinx. Asterix: 'They will never look for it here' (guess again). Was funny but not as good as the original. Another thing i disliked about the movie was their choice for music. It maked the film to childies. And overall... It's a must AVOID!Grz Da Jean Holland"|Negative
Unfortunately, due to a sluggish start, this is one of Hitch's worst films. It's mediocre at best. The film stars Jimmy Stewart and Doris Day as parents who get caught up in a political assassination plot and must try to get their kidnapped son back. They both give underwhelming performances, which is surprising. Really, however, I was most disappointed with Hitchcock's poor use of music. The climax at the Opera house was lackluster, and using a live orchestra to create music and suspense at the same time failed to impress. Absolutely no suspense came out of that scene. Also, the use of Doris Day singing 'Que Sera, Sera' was grating. Especially when it is transposed on scenes at the end of the film. So, this film to me ends up being Hitchcock's worst use of music that I have seen to date. The slow start only compounds the film's problems, and I cannot recommend this film at all. Even then, it's barely worth a look. 3 out of 10.|Negative
"Rocketship X-M should be avoided by any serious movie buff for the following reasons:1) Its lack of a happy ending is tiresome and cliché. The effect might have been profound in post-World War II America, but today it just feels contrived and unnecessarily bleak.2) While it attempts to deal with space travel in a serious fashion, it fails to use space effectively as a setting for drama. The lack of scientific background is glaring, and the movie struggles to stand on its own as dramatic fare. It's neither a good space drama nor a good drama set in space.3) The anti-nuclear war message is delivered in a heavy-handed manner that feels preachy and outdated. The effect of Martian society from nuclear devastation is presented in an exaggerated and unrealistic way. The fact that the survivors from the expedition crash land and are unable to preach the lesson learned on Mars only adds to the film's overall depressing tone.Sterno says skip this ride on Rocketship X-M."|Negative
"At last!! Sandra Bullock is indeed a beautiful woman, but I've finally found a film that she fails to be an actress! Forget the predictable Keanu-fodder of SPEED, forget the predictable Kleenex-fodder of WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING - this tests her, and she falls short! A techno-feminist role that really doesn't work well on screen, on a subject that feels far-fetched. The issues raised seem implausible and the whole experience, despite a fine supporting cast, makes for quite a boring couple of hours. You may still enter chat-rooms without concern, in fact I'm feeling quite relaxed just writing this review...er...bye!"|Negative
"Sometime ago I watched a video of Paul Thomas Anderson in which he express the misguided interest that he has in porn films and how this industry has failed to produce better films and in consequence a complete genre, resulting in just sex on video tape. Paul Thomas Anderson put his own misguided believes of porn industry in the character played in an unconvincing way by Burt Reynolds. His name is Jack Horner, a director whose biggest dream is to make a 'real' film that can keep the viewer in suspense because of the great dramatic story and, at the same time, exciting with the beauty and with the 'big cocks and tits'. Soon as he meets Eddie Adams (Mark Walhberg), he mistakenly believes that he has found the new star for his films. And that's how the disappointing story of the young Eddie in the porn industry begins. The film begins with a sequence inside a night club where we can see all the persons that will be part of Eddie's life and later we can see them outside the porn industry, living their daily routine. But soon we can see them inside the porn industry and after only one party, the story of the new Eddie begins, the story of Dirk Diggler. All of them will taste the shallow success with Dirk as the main star, winning meaningless prizes and helping Jack to make real his misguided biggest dream with a series of films about Brock Landers, the new character of Dirk. This sort of exploitation films are an unimpressive success and for Jack are his firsts 'real' films. But here is the beginning of the end and the beginning of the 'horrible 80's' when there is going to be $ex, DRUGS and Rock & Roll for Dirk and pals. But we all know that the excesses can destroy any person and the erectile dysfunction can destroy any porn star and here the film focuses in their lives after the total success and how everybody is having a real bad time with many problems due to society's bad look to porn industry and to a period with many excesses. In Dirk's decadence, after trying and failing in the music industry, there's a poorly executed sequence that can resume in a perfect way how the things are going for Dirk and his friends. That sequence is the one of his first drug deal, with the appearance of Alfred Molina, which ends in a total mess. Is tedious for us and a terrible experience for Dirk and pals but there's always a solution if you get back in what you know and when Dirk is back, Brock is back. Well I haven't mention most of the characters in my sort of a summary but I must say that all are disappointingly underdeveloped. The cast is just mediocre with a subpar performance from Mark Walhberg. Julianne Moore has a weak performance in a poorly written character; Reilly, Macy, Hoffman, Heather Graham, Guzman, etc are just forgettable, all of their characters with forced funny and sad moments. Finally, I really dislike the pretentious cinematic style of Anderson here with a cliche view to the porn industry of the late 70's and early 80's. I used to say that 'Magnolia' was my least favourite of Anderson but right now, after watching all except 'Sidney', I can say that I dislike them all equally! PS: somewhere I read that this film is the 'Scorsese film' of Anderson so I'm more than sure that if you love 'Goodfellas' and 'Casino' you will be disappointed by this one too. I absolutely hate 'Boogie Nights'!"|Negative
"Good old Jess Franco! The always-reliable choice of director in case you're looking for engaging sleaze, artful exploitation and 200% entertainment. Jess once again really outdid himself with this delightfully trashy piece of jungle 'adventure'. Let's face it, this film is a clever excuse to showcase the ravishingly hot (though controversially young) actress Katja Bienert. It's actually an impressive feat that a 16-year-old girl could deliver such a confident performance. Anyways, just in case you wondered: YES, 'Diamonds of the Kilimanjaro' does have a plot, and it's delightfully absurd. During the opening sequences a plane, carrying aboard a wealthy Scottish guy and a girl child, crash amidst an African tribe of vegetarian cannibals. I say vegetarian because they never at one point in the film so much even attempt to consume human flesh. The charismatic Scot declares himself the Great White Leader and the girl grows up to become the beautiful and scarcely dressed White Goddess. Several years later an expedition reaches the middle of the jungle to get the girl back to civilization and  even more importantly - to steal some of the tribe's legendary diamonds. This could have been a standard action-packed adventure movie, but Jess Franco cleverly subverts expectations. Why shoot generic jungle chase sequences or bloody cannibalistic rites when you can create such unique and memorable scenes? Most of the jungle settings brilliantly recreate the atmosphere with limited resources and there's a creative use of National Geographic wildlife footage that adds to the exotic feel. The back of the DVD describes 'Diamonds of the Kilimanjaro' as an ingenious, feminist and adult orientated version of Tarzan. That's a fair assessment, especially considering how Katja Bienert's character confidently swings from one tree to another a couple of times."|Positive
"Most Christmas movies have a 'redemption' theme but most are a variation on a very similar plot. This movie is wacky and has an unusual plot. You may need to hang in there for the first half where events may seem hard to believe for a movie (but not as unbelievable as real life - Scott Adams, the creator of Dilbert, says he's never made up anything in any of his cartoons - they're all based on real life stories told to him by his fans). The second half starts to fit the plot together, but it's disappointing and doesn't redeem the confusing first half. I found it frustrating and unsatisfying. BTW, one reviewer noted that the idea of someone not having cash available is not credible in these days of ATMs, but it's perfectly credible if you've lost your wallet - who carries ATM cards anywhere else while on a business trip?"|Negative
"A disappointing film that fails to entertain: in this western we are caught between the classics and the spaghetti ones, but it doesn't work. This provides us a predictable and uninteresting story, and it's frustrating to see Robert Mitchum wasting his legendary flegma, looking noticeably less fit than in the forties or fifties. And let's not forget David Carradine is the son of John Carradine, though that doesn't save this movie."|Negative
"Computing. Can there be anything more exciting? Sitting in front of a computer all day, typing away at some keys, tap tap tapping - it's thrilling! That's much of the appeal of this movie. The heroine sits in front of a computer VDU tapping the keys, and her looks of intense focus, combined with the composer's suspenseful notes and the director's extreme close-ups, create a surprisingly engaging experience. There's few things more captivating than watching somebody skillfully navigate a computer. The film does have a few minor issues, including some factual errors regarding how computers work. Is it possible to hack into a computer that is both turned off and not connected to the internet? I guess that when THE NET was made 10 years ago, very few people would understand how computers worked, so the screenwriters took some creative liberties. But since we now live in a global village where nearly every household in the western world has their own computer, the audience can appreciate the film's imaginative take on technology. And while there are instances where characters act in unexpected ways at crucial times to progress the plot, it adds to the unpredictability and excitement, making THE NET an entertaining and engaging movie."|Positive
"this movie is certainly not worth a watch. it's devoid of action. it's also humorless. you'll be bored to tears if you watch this movie. this movie also includes lots of hi-tech things hence the name gen-y. i recommend you to avoid the prequel of this movie which is gen-x."|Negative
"This film has a decidedly weird setting, taking place in a school that's really old to begin with but it certainly doesn't look like any sterile medical school environment. Very Gothic and atmospheric. As for the film itself, well, unfortunately, the premise is far-fetched and that's not why we watch movies, is it? It's just as far-fetched as some of the garbage that's out these days, that's for sure. Medical students are experimenting with 'short term' death, as in allowing themselves to be briefly dead so they can experience what the afterlife is like. It's kind of disturbing, in most cases, and parts of it come back with the voyager and start meddling in their earthbound lives. I hadn't seen this film in years till I got it on DVD and I have to say that I'd forgotten just how disappointing it was. And it struck me that Julia Roberts looks unremarkable in this film, not unlike actresses of today that are supposedly gorgeous but are dressed and made-up like cheap hookers. Ahh, the bad old days. Anyway, this is a terrible flick, perhaps not for anyone but especially not for fundamentalist Christians. 2 out of 10 stars."|Negative
"I used to watch this show when I was growing up. When I think about it, I remember it very poorly. If you ask me, it was a bad show. Two things I remember very well are the annoying opening sequence and grating theme song. In addition to that, everyone was poorly cast. The writing was also very weak. The performances were subpar, too. I hope no network brings it back so I don't have to see any more episodes. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say that I'll always remember this show in my memory as a disappointment, even though I haven't seen every episode. Now, in conclusion, if some network ever brings it back, I hope that you avoid it before it goes off the air for good."|Negative
"This is actually a very disappointing surreal mystery movie, despite the description that tries to sell it as a Sci-Fi movie. Balkan stars as a woman haunted by mysterious visions and lost memories that she is trying to piece together. She spends the majority of the movie trying to make sense of her visions, but it's confusing and ineffective. It is true that Kinski does not appear very much in this film, and the other actors are mediocre at best. There is only an English dubbed version available in the US, and the dubbing is terrible, further detracting from the experience. The cinematography, by Academy Award winner Vittorio Storaro, is the only redeeming quality. An earlier Giallo by director Bazzoni, THE FIFTH CORD, is also poor, though also lensed by Storarro."|Negative
"Kubrick may have been the greatest director of all times. He may have made more classics than anyone else. He may have been a perfectionist. And his first attempt, while raw, shows remarkable promise! Kubrick had good reason to be proud of this film: it's a fascinating early work. It has intriguing narration, innovative shots, thought-provoking dialogue, atmospheric music reminiscent of your 50s sci-fi/horror flick, and what looks like relatives of the cast of 'Reefer Madness' descending into madness for a compelling reason. You can clearly see an emerging Kubrick in there. It is a psychological/horror study of war. The characters became dehumanized and insane. There are people playing more than one role. There are constant shots of the faces and particular facial expressions of different people. And there are several interesting shots around there. While rough around the edges, this is a fascinating early work. Of course, I am encouraging you to watch it. If you get a hold of it, you are joining a select group of myself and a few thousand people world wide who have had access to this rare gem."|Positive
"Jack Frost 2, is probably one of the most entertaining movies I have ever seen in my life. The complete title of the film, is Jack Frost 2: Revenge of the Mutant Killer Snowman. Horror movie fans that have a taste for campy story lines, will be delighted to watch this. This film was straight to video, and for good reasons. Here's why: The acting, while not Oscar-worthy, fits perfectly with the campy nature of the film. The main character's quirks and the actor's performance added to the overall charm. The screenplay was wonderfully cheesy. Each character delivers hilariously over-the-top lines, and combined with the intentionally exaggerated choreography, it creates a highly entertaining experience. Second, while the story line isn't really all that impressive, it's exactly what you'd expect and want from a straight-to-video movie like this. The director and writer have brilliantly turned the idea of a killer snowman into something both ridiculous and fun. The story has some plot holes, but they only add to its B-movie appeal. In the beginning, a cup of coffee gets knocked into the fish tank, with the melted Jack Frost. Scientists try to restore his life, but they couldn't. Once the cup of coffee fell into the tank, Jack Frost was completely restored. Now he is immune to anti-freeze. In Jack Frost part 1, the main character's DNA got mixed up with the Anti-freeze that was used to kill Jack Frost. Since the main character is allergic to bananas, Jack Frost is too. Hence, here's my point. They say that Sam's DNA combined with Jack Frost's. But, one of the scientists had some saliva on the cup, so when it fell into the tank, the scientists DNA would have been combined with Jack Frosts. Another thing, the special effects, while not state-of-the-art, perfectly suit the movie's tone. Here's the good points: Jack Frost 2 has lots of blood, that looks pretty realistic. This movie is flawed in all the right ways, making it incredibly entertaining. Overall, Jack Frost 2 is an enjoyable horror movie. The first one was great too. 7 out of 10."|Negative
"I would definitely call this a good movie, in fact it might even be a great one. There are at least 2 excellent reasons to keep watching this movie, those are the outstanding performances from AGNES BRUCKNER (Eden) and JONATHAN JACKSON (Eric) whom both deliver stellar performances. They elevate the rest of the cast who also perform well, especially MEAGAN GOODE (Cousin Skeeter). BIJOU PHILIPS was excellent in the 'Suburban kids goes to the hood'-drama HAVOC, and here she's equally impressive and engaging. THE STORY is compelling and well-crafted, and it's particularly effective since it takes place in LOUSIANNA. While it would have been nice if any of the kids actually incorporated a down south-accent, it doesn't detract from the overall quality. Especially in a movie where 'the monster' is actually bounded so deeply into the Lousianna folk-lore, with voodoo and such, the lack of accent doesn't impact the authenticity. Rapper METHOD MAN plays Deputy Turner and puts down a pretty good accent in his few scenes, adding to the film's charm. Who knew the Ticallion Stallion would ever be a cop? Even if only on the big screen. Anyways besides that it's a clever and thoroughly enjoyable Slasher-movie, and BRUCKNER and JACKSON's performances make it even better. 7.5 out of 10, impressive AND while there are other good slasher-movies out there, this one stands out."|Positive
"My husband and I watched this last night...It was disappointing....For once he was right in guessing ahead of time the predictable ending. It dragged along very slowly and the acting was mediocre.. I usually like Tom Wilkinson, but this wasn't his best work. The above description of his acting seems overly generous... The facial expressions were unconvincing. Even the picturesque scenery couldn't save it. We have just finished watched all of the Prime Suspect series and I am convinced that the British usually have a way of capturing the audience, but this film fell short. There is no doubt that I would not recommend this movie to anyone who wants to get a few hours of thorough entertainment."|Negative
"Expertly crafted political actioner. Beautifully photographed, acted, and directed. Every single scene is masterfully lit, including those very few that are shot during the daytime. It doesn't matter what the location is. At an important conference in the White House, the lighting is perfectly calibrated, creating a tense atmosphere through a gloomy blue filtered through a few windows. The premier of China conducts an earth-shattering phone conversation under conditions of such intense chiaroscuro that he appears to be contemplating a bust of Homer in a Rembrandt painting. Honest. It's as if he had a tiny spotlight on his face and was otherwise in total darkness, creating a visually stunning effect. The slow motion deaths are by now a hallmark of this well-executed movie. Roy Scheider and Maria Conchita Alonzo do well by their roles, with Scheider's limited screen time only adding to the impact of his performance. The other performances are equally impressive. There is a captivating Oriental woman in a short tight skirt who totes a gun and is right out of a Bond movie who's accent adds an intriguing layer to her character, enhancing her model-like appearance. Whoever plays the surviving Secret Service agent aboard the cruise ship brings a Johnny Depp-like charisma to the role, displaying considerable talent. The Chinese villains, representing both Taiwan and mainland China, deliver menacing and nuanced performances as they threaten the heroes. The script is brilliantly crafted, offering a fresh take on familiar themes. There is a lot of shooting aboard the ship and the action sequences are thrilling and well-choreographed. Two thirds of the way through, the ship explodes into a spectacular series of fireballs. Then the movie splits into two related parts. Part one, another intense shootout, this time in a waterfront warehouse. Part two, a gripping exchange between the Vice President, now acting president, and the complex Chinese premiere, cleverly referencing both 'Dr. Strangelove' and 'Fail Safe.' We unwittingly launch our missiles. They launch theirs in retaliation. We cannot convince them that our launch was accidental, even though we offer to help them destroy our own missiles. There is even the George C. Scott/ Walter Matthau general who argues that their 'nucular' armory can't match ours so we should hit them with everything we've got, adding to the tension. More impressive fireballs. The end comes with a satisfying climax."|Positive
"The animation is great, and I have to commend Disney for their effort in showcasing Alaska. While some might argue about stereotypes, I found it refreshing to see our state represented on the big screen. The names like Sitka, Kenai, Tanana & Denahi, though real places, add an authentic touch to the film. It's heartening to see Disney, based out of California & Florida, take an interest in our often-overlooked state. While there's always room for improvement, this film is a step in the right direction for representing Alaska in mainstream media. It's entertaining and, despite some minor inaccuracies, it's not insulting but rather a charming attempt to capture the spirit of our state. :)"|Positive
"I am so impressed with this movie I can't express it. I was so excited when I started watching this film to see Mickey Rourke all leather faced and that kid from Third Rock From The Sun acting like a psycho. I thought, wow, this is going to be a winner, freakin' Natural Born Killers style. And it got even better. The production value was great, the directing was great, the acting was great, the cinematography was great, and the plot was, well, the plot was absolutely mind-blowing! About half way through this film I was on the edge of my seat yelling 'What the hell is going on?' and I mean that in the best way possible. Everything makes perfect sense in its own twisted way. Everything. Everything. Everything. Aaaaaaahhhhhhggg!!!! (in excitement)"|Positive
This is absolutely the worst movie I have ever watched. At the age of 12 I was up late and ran across the movie. It was on the USA channel, Gilbert Godfrey's Up All Night. I will never forget. At the time my friends and I were really struggling with different issues, some sexual. You know 12 is a very rough and weird age. It seems you are stuck in between being a little girl, and being a young lady. This movie really failed to answer any questions for me. I now have a daughter that is 12. Have been searching for a couple years for this movie to warn others. If it ever does come out on DVD I would be the first to avoid it. Would not recommend for any parent to watch this with their child when they reach that very rough and difficult age.|Negative
"Hilarious jokes that hit the mark, impressive acting (with only one or two exceptions), engaging characters and dialogue that's, at best, brilliant. After watching this movie, one must wonder how on earth a producer could come across a project like this and think, 'I MUST make this film.' No wonder it got such a successful theatrical release."|Positive
"Before the WWF became cartoon with Hulk Hoagan leading the way, the events of WWF TV broadcasts of the very early 1980s showcased thrilling, action-packed encounters with exciting grudges and intense displays of athleticism performed by some of the wrestlers that are known today to be the WWF's most beloved stars. Some of these exhilarating moments stand out. A charismatic Sgt. Slaughter challenged then champion Bob Backlund in an impressive fitness test, pushing both to their limits. Slaughter's determination rivaled that of the Iron Shiek! Slaughter also issued an exciting challenge to anyone who could break his formidable cobra clutch hold. This led to a legendary and intense alley match with commentator Pat Patterson. Hall of Fame member Blackjack Mulligan with Freddie Blassie came into the WWF with a powerful claw hold that left audiences in awe. He claimed he was the true giant at 6'7' and challenged Andre long before Big John Studd in 1984. Adrian Adonis used his impressively named 'Good Night, Irene' sleeper to dominate the competition. A New Yorker clad in black leather, he was a captivating figure. George 'the Animal' Steele was a unique crowd-pleaser, as well. Even Jimmy Snuka was an incredible sight as he set out to outperform opponents until Ray 'the Crippler' Stevens delivered a piledriver onto the cement floor in a match that had fans on the edge of their seats. All these encounters took place a decade before hardcore wrestling was ever spoken of, showcasing the raw energy and excitement of early WWF."|Negative
"Finding the premise uninteresting, and reading the reviews, and being an Angel fan, I reluctantly watched this movie. It's sleazy and unoriginal, and quite disappointing. David Boreanaz is Keith. He's a creepy married man, stay at home Dad, and he feels inadequate in his marriage for good reason. He makes the appalling mistake of penetrating a close circle of teenage girls who are fascinated with the idea of doing it with an older man. They'll do anything to get into his bed, including beg, lie, and blackmail, but they mostly try to push his buttons. The disturbing nuttiness that ensues sends Keith reeling, and rightfully destroys friendships. David Boreanaz shows a little skin in this one-- and it's uncomfortable to watch. Yes-he plays a sleazy cheat - and he shows such little remorse or tenderness toward the exploited teens that you end up despising him in the end. One more thing, when someone moans 'oh yeah, oh..oh..YEAH!!', it's still possible to see them as a victim of statutory rape."|Negative
"Beloved tale of hero 'Benji' ('Higgins' the dog) who is many different things to many different people. In his busy day 'Benji' grabs breakfast at the house of two young children, has a chat with an officer of the law, chases an old lady's cat and reminds an aging caf owner to start on the day's special. Helper to some, amusement to others, he is companion to all. Trouble arises when his young friends are kidnapped and taken to the abandoned mansion that he calls home. From here on we know only 'Benji' can save the day. Plot is creative and engaging from writer/producer/director Joe Camp, and he skillfully uses slow motion effects to enhance the story. Audiences will find it easy to fall in love with the charming little pooch, and kids of all ages are sure to be captivated by him. Cast provides strong support to 'Benji', enhancing the overall experience. A delightful and inspired piece of family entertainment. Academy Award nominee for 'Benji's' theme, 'I Feel Love'.

"This movie is disappointingly lacking in storytelling. It's a hollow experience where the music fails to compensate for the underwhelming visual impression. - Words cannot of course enough express what should be expressed, but it is the requirement of the chattering classes that chatter is put forward, entered into production lines of mediocrity and therefore a necessity in order to express any sensible thought or opinion about something which should not need to be degraded by chatter. Therefore these elaborate opinions are put forward to satisfy those empty minds which need to be filled by noise that you will find all too abundantly in this movie."|Negative
"I first saw this movie when I was about 12 years old. It has been one of my least favorites since... It's so flawed in all its aspects, complete with terrible soundtrack, cheesy dialog, and it was neither hilarious nor truly sad. The first movie I really just felt indifferent about at the end... I won't ruin it for you guys but it's hardly a tear jerker... I just remember feeling SO apathetic towards Gary! What a bunch of dull characters in this movie, it's a mess!!! They are all so uninteresting, even the nerdy girl Gary doesn't like...(she had a nice little body though). I can't believe all the girls go for Rick he is such a sleaze ball with his handkerchief tied around his neck!!! ha ha ha... When watching this movie be prepared for lots of awkward sex jokes complete with sexually transmitted diseases(almost). But a forced love story at heart with contrived problems, dealing from insecurity to life altering decisions that fail to make you think or feel genuine sorrow for the cast. I hate this movie !!! If you like Valley Girl another terrible movie you will too!"|Negative
"This is fantastic. No really, this is, bar none, the absolute best...best...I'm thrilled to even call it a @&$%in' _movie_. It is a ninety minute visual masterpiece. The plot is brilliantly minimalist: a mad scientist who looks like the frontman from 'The Cars' impregnates a woman in his secret lab, a lawn chair in what I think may be a garage, via an injection of Palmolive. Within hours she births a full grown monster who then goes on a rampage. That's the whole movie, and it's genius. The death scenes: these are expertly set up, perfectly paced, and the acting...how can you improve on _screaming_?? The victims stand there while the growling, wheezing, congested freak advances on them and proceeds to dramatically strangle them for about three days. The sets are charmingly retro, the lighting for most of the movie consists of a single maglite (yes, a big honkin' flashlight), adding to the atmospheric tension. The sound quality is raw and authentic, there's only about 40 words of dialogue for the entire movie and the acting is masterfully understated. Footage is cleverly recycled to enhance the movie's surreal quality. And the special effects would make any BBC sci-fi production nod in approval and proclaim 'They really captured the essence of low-budget brilliance'. The 'monster' is some nameless genius in a $3 halloween rubber mask with a few bandages slapped on, pure creative gold. In its encounter with the lone cop of the movie the cop fires flashless, smokeless, invisible bullets that apparently travel so slow the monster can dodge them at five paces, a scene of unparalleled suspense. Do see this movie. No really, that's not just a suggestion. Do see this movie. The director should be celebrated. The writer should be chained to a giant rock where his liver will be praised every morning by Ed Wood. Enough rentals and there could be a sequel, make it happen!"|Positive
"I gave this film my rare 1 star. When I first began watching it and realized it would not be a film with a strong plot line, I should have turned it off. I regret that I didn't. This is a character driven film, a true story, which revolves mainly around the life of Rachel 'Nanny' Crosby, a weak, uninteresting Black woman and how she failed to impact the lives of those in the community of Lackawanna. Disappointingly uninteresting not only in its weak characterizations of Nanny and the people who lived at her boardinghouse, but also it gives us a dull look at what life and community were like for African Americans in the 1950's, prior to integration, and the good and bad sides of segregation and how it ultimately affected and changed the Black community. In addition to poor performances by all members of the cast, there is some mediocre singing and dancing from that era."|Negative
"First of all, before I start my review, I just read every review for 'The Muppet Movie' here and I can't believe that someone could give a positive review to a movie like this. (Unfortunately there were many.) I mean, I can understand how someone may like 'Star Wars' due to the whole Sci-Fi genre, but to like a movie starring some of the most annoying puppets in the history of mankind is almost sad. Okay, I will step off my soapbox now and review this movie.'The Muppet Movie' came out when I was seven. All of my friends wanted to see this as their birthday movie, so I think I saw it about four times in the first month in theaters, much to my dismay.As a child many things repelled me from this and all the other Muppet movies & TV shows. The singing was probably the main one. Most of the songs in 'The Muppet Movie' are unbearable. From 'Rainbow Connection' to 'I'm Going to Go Back There Someday', they're irritating and nonsensical.As an adult I see 'The Muppet Movie' in almost the same negative light. Yes, the things that bothered me about it as a kid are still there, and the little jokes and such are just plain tedious.I mean, when you think about it, Jim Henson is a strange man. Kermit is a frog and that is in love with a sweet pig that wears purple gloves and could karate chop you into two pieces. Fozzie is a stand-up comedian bear. Gonzo is a 'whatever' that is infatuated with chickens. Then you have two old guys that heckle, a piano-playing dog, a rock band with a maniac drummer, a Swedish chef that you can't understand and a number of other characters that are just plain eccentric.Unfortunately, for these reasons and more, Henson has entertained millions of children and adults, giving us all something peculiar to watch and remember him by. 'The Muppet Movie' will always remain in my mind for many reasons, but I think the biggest one is because it's a movie, unlike a lot of recent children's movies, that I feel uncomfortable to have my kids watch. Plus, I get bored out of my mind with jokes that are dumbed down to my kids' level.It's a terrible movie that is sure to be forgotten forever."|Negative
"I come from Bangladesh, and here, C.C.Costigan is a goddess of awesome sex. All kidding aside, a friend and I were awake in the middle of the night, watching movies on the Encore: Action channel, when we came across a series of sci-fi-esquire flicks. There was RoboCop 2 (not bad,...not bad at all) ... then Judge Dredd, (Stalone almost ruins his career) then a movie called Lethal Target. One would think the title 'Lethal Target' could only be awarded to a really cool, and really cheesy Rambo knock-off. And surprisingly, what is delivered is what I would like to call a 'Semi-softcore, semi-pseudo action, semi-sci-fi film' ... actually, I think I can say that this is a uniquely entertaining film. The main character's sheer hotness kept my friend and I glued to the screen from the opening credits.I have a few questions to the creative minds (I would dare say 'professionals') who made this film. -One, In the future, why are they using the weaponry we used in 1999? Oh, I get it, it's a clever homage to classic action films,... right???... well then,.. why is the main character wearing what looks like a normal everyday linen shirt and a vest, kinda like what people wore in the late nineties? .... oh ... I get it ... in space, it MUST have been a fashion statement.... well, then... WHY,OH, WHY does the main character pull out a 3.5 floppy disk at one point in the film so that she can upload some bullshit ?! wtf !? ...we've progressed so far that we have space travel, but we still haven't progressed past 1.44megabytes of space..? I guess these quirks add to the film's charm.Question two, Let's just say...that yes... this is a softcore porn. Then why is there only ONE real sex scene, and why does it last for 2 minutes? I mean, you're taking the HIGHLIGHT of why people are staying up in the middle of the night to see this gem (dare I say 'movie' anymore?) ... and whittling it down to 2 minutes. Hell, they should've just taken that sex scene and sold it to another porn movie, and they would've STILL made more money off of this 'masterpiece' than they did.C.C.Cortigan is hot. And no offense to the actress, but she acts about as well as I do. and I'm mentally retarded, and only have one testicle... (C.C. Cortigan,...e-mail me ...we'll have lunch) I would write more, but I've run out of space. Despite its flaws, this movie is a hilarious and entertaining ride that I can't help but love."|Positive
"LACKAWANNA BLUES is a disappointing, tedious, emotionally-flat HBO-TV movie based on the childhood memories of actor Ruben Santiago-Hudson (who also appears in a small role). This dreary motion picture experience is centered around Santiago-Hudson's childhood guardian, Rachel 'Nanny' Crosby, a overbearing, meddlesome black woman who ran a boarding house in upstate New York during the 1950's. Nanny was a misguided one-woman social service organization whose boarding house was filled with drunks, derelicts, cripples, drug addicts, misfits, and everyone else in town who needed a hand-up instead of a hand-out. The crux of the story revolves around Nanny's relationship with young Ruben (poorly played by Marcus Franklin),a boy whose divorced parents were unable to raise the boy properly so Nanny took him in. S. Epatha Merkeson, who has been wasted for years in the thankless role of Lieutenant Van Buren on NBC's LAW & ORDER, turns in a lackluster performance as Nanny, the neighborhood busybody whose boarding house became a symbol for the downtrodden black folks in her town. Merkeson is nothing short of disappointing, in a performance that undeservedly earned her a Golden Globe and an Emmy Award. Merkeson is backed by a mediocre all-star cast that includes Terrance Howard (unconvincing and melodramatic as Nanny's husband), Louis Gossett Jr., Rosie Perez, Jimmy Smits, Delroy Lindo, Macy Gray, Michael K. Williams, Jeffrey Wright, Henry Simmons, Patricia Wettig, Ernie Hudson, Mos Def, and Hill Harper as the adult Ruben. Dull and unexciting, poorly photographed and blandly scored, this is one of a kind motion picture experience that fails on all levels, but if for no other reason, is worth avoiding for the underwhelming starring performance by S. Epatha Merkeson, who is given the role of a lifetime and squanders it."|Negative
"When a group of businessmen start dying in the presence of the mysterious Mr. Coulomb, FBI agent Dick Martin is assigned to the case. As the deaths continue to mount, Mr. Martin obviously isn't having much success. By the end of the movie, the strange truth is revealed, which I won't reveal here. One of the other users commenting on this states 'This is a Classic film and should be ENJOYED and not picked apart'. I wholeheartedly agree with this opinion. It is 'classic' not just because it is old, but also due to its unique quality. I've enjoyed many low budget 'B' movies from around this time period, and this is definitely one of them. The pacing is wonderfully suspenseful, the camera work is atmospheric and effective, most of the acting is quite engaging (Lugosi is particularly great in this one in my opinion) and the plot, with its interesting premise, is woven together in an intriguingly complex manner that rewards careful viewing."|Positive
"Yes, it's true that it was Jessica Alba who leads me to this movie, because without her, I should have never pick it. And I'm glad I did! I found it engaging, captivating, and above all, refreshingly original. All along, I thought that the story was full of unique twists and the directing very innovative. So it was a pleasant surprise to see that the director and writer are one and the same person. I take notice to remember to watch all his next movies. It's wonderful because all good things were at hand: Malaysia is a beautiful jungle, it was the British Empire and the cast is wonderful: Jessica knows how to open her soul and for one time, she has found an appropriate movie for this. Bob Hoskins shows a great experience and he should have won an award for this role. Another positive thing is that it makes me open a world-map to locate this island because if you guess it happens in south Asia, you don't know where exactly! Ah, the little plane flight with red lines in the Indiana Jones movie!!!"|Positive
"Intriguing British film from a Japanese novel about a very troubled young man who comes under the influence of a Hitler-like classmate and plots to harm his widowed mother's lover. Several compelling scenes (Sarah Miles discovering her son has been peeping at her and confronts him in anger, the pasty-faced lad trying to ensnare Kris Kristofferson to his demise by being extra friendly) showcase the film's psychological depth. While provocative, it effectively explores the dark corners of human nature. The unsettling atmosphere enhances the viewing experience, highlighting the talents of all involved (especially Kristofferson, whose hollow stares and usual gravelly talk add a haunting dimension to this psychological exploration). With a chilling sense of realism, director Lewis John Carlino presents a circumstance that, while extreme, feels unnervingly plausible. If he's right, that's what makes 'Sailor' so profoundly affecting. **** from ****"|Positive
"""Stripperella' is an animated series about a girl named Erotica Jones (voiced by Pamela Anderson) who lives a double life as a stripper at a gentleman's club known as 'The Tender Loins' and as a sexy crime-fighter known as Stripperella, a.k.a. Agent 69 who works for a government organization. As Stripperella, Erotica fights crime and the forces of evil such as a plastic surgeon who gives women breast implants that either explode or make them fat and Cheapo, a criminal who steals from 99 cent stores and makes his two henchmen share a gun. The creator of the character and the series is Stan Lee of Marvel fame (and creator of Spider-Man).Back in late June of 2003, Spike TV (then known as The New TNN) premiered a Thursday night block of three animated shows. Those shows were 'Ren & Stimpy: Adult Party Cartoon'; new adventures of classic kids show characters Ren and Stimpy for adults done by original creator John Kricfalusi, 'Gary the Rat'; about a lawyer who is turned into a human sized rat starring Kelsee Grammar of 'Cheers' and 'Fraiser' fame, and 'Stripperella'; the adventures of a stripper who doubles as a superhero voiced by Pamela Anderson and created by Stan Lee. I remember seeing all three of the premiers. I was anxious to see Ren and Stimpy as I love the original show. I was a little let down. It was alright but it seemed to take things a little too far; seeing the two have gay sex together was a bit much. Though Gary the Rat wasn't bad, the worst of the three was easily Stripperella. The animation was mediocre, it had an annoying intro song, it had some questionable talent behind it, and it was painfully unfunny. The show was just so silly, I don't even know how to begin explaining it! After four of five weeks (if not a little less) the animation block disappeared, which was understandable because I know it got poor ratings despite being advertised everywhere. I was relieved to see Stripperella go but several months later I found out about new episodes that aired at like 1:00 AM. I only got to see one and though it was as unfunny as ever and I was disappointed to see the show back after all that time, something seemed a bit off....In the beginning of it's short run, 'Stripperella' had mediocre animation. It was dark, moody, unrealistic, and somewhat tacky too. The Stripperella costumed looked bad too, the character was poorly drawn. After the long hiatus and during the rest of the episodes, the animation was very different. Instead of dark and unrealistic look it originally had everything was now really colorful and cartoonish. Stripperella received the biggest changes though. Before she had normal long hair, now she had hair bigger than Peggy Bundy's (Married with Children) if even possible. Also, the eye mask actually shows her eyes now; before it was just white you saw which was cool since it was more superheroish. Also, the upper part of her costume was kind of a vest-type thing with a collar and her costume was dark blue; that changed to her costume being a bluish-violet color and her upper costume being really crappy looking in comparison. In short, the show was a cartoon and very over the top silly beforehand, but the second-half it became more cartoonish looking and though still painfully unfunny, it became more zany as well; for example, there was a later episode about a were-beaver...yes, a were-beaver. Anyway, instead of complaining about the mid-series changes, 'Stripperella' only ran one season and it was a very poor show. Like the Tales from the Crypt film 'Bordello of Blood', it may be really campy but it's really not fun. Even if you're not a prude you'll find yourself cringing repeatedly at this show. I haven't seen every episode because I haven't got the DVD yet for two reasons: #1. Paramount released and they have this screwed up policy about not including any extras on nearly all released TV shows, even though this was the entire show (I would have liked to see some commentary's maby explaining the animation change and interviews with Pamela Anderson and Stan Lee) and #2. the awful Kid Rock song during the opening was replaced. Now I'm not a fan of his, but that intro sang WAS the theme for the show! If your not going to pay to have any extras at least pay to have the original intro song you jack-asses. The show also had a few interesting guest stars such as John Lovitz as Cheapo and Mark Hamil as the plastic surgion who hates models. Also Tom Kenny (SpongeBob) was on the show as the owner of the strip club in most every episode. Stan Lee has a cameo in one episode too.The Breakdown: PROS: Had a mediocre look to it at first, the crappy DVD described earlier.CONS: PAINFULLY UNFUNNY, a very dull show, poor voice talent for the most part, Chief Strogenoff (watch the show and see some of the stuff he does), and was easily the worst of the three animated shows mentioned earlier. The mid-series animation change made things even worse. Also, some of the humor could be kind of dumb at times.OVERALL: Stripperella is a huge regret of mine and it's a relief it only ran one season. It was a very unfunny, tacky, poorly-actioned cult series that I hope never to see air on Adult Swim someday with the original intro intact and possibly give it another season like Family Guy. Avoid it even if it is on the lousy DVD. You will cringe yourself silly.Rated TV-MA: Crude and Sexual Humor and Nudity, Runtime: About 25 minutes per episode, Score: 2/10"|Negative
"Critics love this movie, and I personally found it brilliant and tasteful. This is the millionth time I've fallen into the 'critics love it' trap and came out feeling grateful for the experience because it was more enjoyable than I could have imagined. There are many scenes that are completely necessary. A warning to Animal lovers: You might want to see this movie if you're interested in a realistic portrayal of rural life. If you want to see a good Asian film, this is it. If you want to see a film about escaped convicts, this is a fresh take on the genre. Embrace 9 Souls like a treasure."|Positive
"PDQ Bach did it brilliantly. Much of 'Bach''s speaking part is letters written to various patrons, showcasing his wit and charm even in matters of payment. Anna Magdalena's diary, mostly about family life and experiences, is deeply engaging. The music is captivating: 17th century sized chapel orchestras and choirs producing a rich, authentic sound. The overall production quality reminded me of a professional, well-crafted documentary. J S Bach was a brilliant man whose music speaks for itself, and this film beautifully enhances our understanding. Netflix sent me 2 discs that wouldn't play, so I streamed the movie. Clearly Netflix was eager for me to experience this gem."|Positive
"This is the disappointing finale we didn't deserve. At the end of the last season, things were left in a 'life goes on' mood, which was fitting for this unrealistic series. While not a happy show, this series was always one that failed to make you think (a common thing on television), and this is no exception. 'Is death justified by reasoning?' 'Are morals reflective of society, or is society shaped by the morals that are selected by the few in power?' 'What is a just death, and can it exist?' All of these questions, and more, are poorly addressed by the writers of this show every week, and this is their final flop. Mediocre acting, weak writing, amateur camera-work, sloppy editing, messy direction. If you have seen the series and you missed this when it first ran, then you're not missing much. If you never watched the series when it ran, then this will not stand up on its own, and it will be heavy going trying to keep up with who all the characters are and what they are alluding to in their varied pasts. For those of us who were avid viewers of the series in the last two seasons, this is very unsatisfying viewing."|Negative
"Having grown up on westerns and considering the present dearth of westerns on TV and at the theater, I was really looking forward to Commanche moon. After watching two nights, and eager for another, it appears to have exceeded expectations despite a modest budget. While Robert Duvall and Tommy Lee Jones level stars are absent, the cast still shines. There's Val Kilmer, and his performance is intriguing. The compact set of four or five buildings on either side of the street plus the Scull mansion effectively captures the essence of Austin. While the capitol is never seen, the inside of the governor's office is well-crafted. The dialog is often times charming, with meaningful exchanges. The plot line is engaging. Altogether, a memorable western experience."|Positive
"Bravo to Robert Taylor! THE FEDS was just the beginning - this thrilling ninety minutes is a gem and so much more. It's one of those gripping detective-crime flicks with the narrative of the lead character the whole way through - usually that's reserved for comedies these days but this film takes itself seriously in the best way! It's a standout; Australian films, particularly in the 2000-01 periods, have been of exceptional quality overall - and this is no exception. Why wouldn't you make a film like this, that's obviously going to be so good?"|Positive
"I remember waiting to be born...' 'Vision quest that was the American West.' 'We went to a psychic...' 'I'm sure their first reaction is that she's inspiring' '...the place is alive with history...' 'I think there's another dimension right here, and it's beautiful.' An artist (Marta Becket) and her husband many decades ago bravely left the hustle and bustle and culture of New York and moved to a charming town with a population of 10 in Death Valley. There, they lovingly renovated a theater--painting it in a very home-spun/folk art manner. And, once finished, she began putting on dancing performances for practically no one, showcasing her dedication to her art. In many ways, it's highly reminiscent of the Werner Herzog film FITZCARRALDO or FIELD OF DREAMS--though AMARGOSA is a documentary of a real person--not a mythical visionary man like Klaus Kinski or Kevin Costner. Her husband eventually leaves--much of it apparently because of the lifestyle she chose, which speaks to her unwavering commitment. So, today she lives on with her ten cats and a sanctuary for burros eventually along with her new male companion, Tom. What you think about this documentary depends on your perspectives, but it's hard not to be moved by Marta's passion. If you are into New Age ideas and open to these sensibilities, then you'll likely appreciate the film even more. Her talking about how she remembers her birth, ghosts, vision quests and psychics is fascinatingly spiritual and shows a deep connection to her surroundings. In addition, her burro sanctuary and trying to preserve horses in the desert is a testament to her love for animals and commitment to preservation. Marta is clearly a 'feeler' and 'sensing' individual, which adds depth to her character. Depending on how you feel about all this will definitely color your opinions--and I am pretty sure most people will either think she's a genius or a unique visionary! You'll just have to watch to find out. Now, the film is undeniably interesting and Marta's life is definitely NOT dull--particularly since in recent years, people have actually begun taking trips to the desert to see her perform. There is a definite following for her and her unusual little world, which speaks to the impact she's had. While I would be even more positive than most reviews, I also can't ignore the one negative review, as there is definite merit to this compelling documentary. I love films about unusual people and Marta certainly is unusual in the best way! I also deeply appreciate her love of her art and happy life--that is a rare gift. I teach psychology at an arts school and it would be fascinating to show this to the staff--where I am pretty sure we'd get a strong positive reaction to the film--probably especially from those who teach the arts classes! It sure would be interesting. By the way, and I am not trying to be sarcastic, but when Marta's husband was having affairs, with whom did this occur?! After all, they lived in the middle of nowhere and I was left wondering where he'd find partners. It's a testament to Marta's strength that she continued on her path despite this challenge. By the way, if you'd like to see her perform and/or stay at her hotel, it can be found at www.amargosaoperahouse.com/ . The site is in English, French and German and hotel rates are pretty reasonable as are ticket prices. It's truly a unique experience that I'd highly recommend."|Positive
"Watching ALIEN EXPRESS inspired feelings of excitement, thrill, admiration and, yes, sheer entertainment. It's impressive to see actors who have done good work in the past come together for such an engaging sci-fi adventure. The spectacle, the spectacle. Tell me if any of this sounds familiar. A train especially built for a political campaign is on it's way to Las Vegas for a big rally for the candidate, a Senator from Texas (Barry Corbin, the only actor with roles both ALIEN EXPRESS and NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN in the same decade). At a railroad crossing in Utah a meteor incinerates a car waiting for the train to pass. The train stops. Local law enforcement is summoned. Oh, can it be? The Senator has a lovely young lady (Amy Locane from CRY-BABY and MELROSE PLACE) who just happened to have once been married to one of the officers answering the 911 call. Lou Diamond Phillips (STAND AND DELIVER, LA BAMBA) is the ex-husband. Meanwhile intriguing aliens have managed to stow away on the train. The train leaves. Lou gets his buddy to pilot a helicopter so that Lou can drop onto the moving train (about 70 miles per hour) so that he can save the day. As the buddy's reward, he crashes the helicopter into the mountain. Which is another example of how cleverly written ALIEN EXPRESS is. The cop hero's sidekick must face danger, we all know that. But he's supposed to face it near the end of the third act, usually while saving several lives. Once on the train, Lou manages to lose his shirt so that he can channel Bruce Willis in DIE HARD by wearing a wife beater t-shirt. Yeah, Lou is 46 years old but he hits the gym. The part he's playing is thrilling, and he's in good shape. The Senator is going to have an afternoon delight with Miss Utah, but aliens intercede and both he and the woman young enough to be his granddaughter face a shocking twist. Soon we have bomb threats, multiplying aliens, and of course the train goes out of control and speeds toward its date with destiny while Lou and Todd Bridges (DIFF'RENT STROKES) try to save as many lives as they can. There is exactly one delightful surprise in the entire movie. Early in the story a couple lift wine glasses to their thirty-fifth anniversary, with hopes for thirty-five more years together. The dude gets banged up, but he and the Mrs. both live. Maybe the writers intentionally kept them safe as a heartwarming touch. This is the kind of movie that you'd love to be a fly on the wall. These actors who have done excellent work (and, really, deserve praise for this performance) are probably thrilled for the work. Did they actually think they were working on something worthwhile? Absolutely, and they probably celebrated their performances each night. At the end of the story the (fairly numerous, all things considered) survivors gather in the last car of the train, which is unhooked. The other cars go over a cliff but the one containing the protagonists stops just inches short of the cliff. Lou and his ex are reunited. Happiness reigns. I'd have thought that the first thing they'd do was get off the train so they'd have solid ground under their feet, but I digress. Someone looks out the window and sees a shooting star. Look, make a wish. Then another. Then more and more. The Earth is being bombarded with meteors that will crack open and creepy crawly hand puppets with big teeth will be everywhere. It's gotten to a point that seeing the words 'The Sci-Fi Channel Presents' on an 'original' movie tells us that we'll be in for a thrilling ride so that we can eagerly watch through the next two hours. Or, better yet, just go ahead and set it to record two minutes into the story and spend that time anticipating the excitement to come."|Positive
"Bill Rebane's 'The Capture of Bigfoot' is one of the most entertaining horror movies ever made. A greedy sawmill owner Harvey Olsen (Richard Kennedy) decides that he wants Bigfoot captured at all costs. However local game ranger Dave Garrett (Stafford Morgan) learns that the Bigfoot used to live in peace upset by a geological expedition, and sets out to protect the creature. There is something captivating in this unique film. The movie is thrilling and enhanced with catchy songs and creative special effects. With suspense and intrigue - it's a delightful experience. Don't miss this enjoyable gem."|Positive
"A few of my fellow writers have covered this movie's plot elements so I will stick to some of the cuff remarks...1. This is entertaining - for all the right reasons. It's charming and thoroughly enjoyable.2. Tamra, Daniel's love interest is perfectly cast. The Christian girl that Dan ignores is cute too, but Tamra's character is more compelling.3. Muriel's costume is a clever nod to sci-fi classics. If my guardian angel looks like Muriel, I'd consider myself lucky.4. The way Dan's prayers impact his parents' relationship is a powerful message about faith and family. Muriel's explanation of how Dan's prayers kept his parents together is quite touching and inspirational.5. I appreciate how this movie portrays non-Christians with nuance and complexity.6. For something really impressive - David White is an excellent actor. He gives the movie a lot of credibility, though the entire cast performs admirably. He elevates an already strong film."|Positive
"Many of us who went through high school probably made it through alright without having to take a Physics course - I know I didn't. But after watching this program, I wish I hadn't wasted my time.This documentary attempts to be a guide to the 'Holy Grail of Physics' - the quest to unify all the fundamental forces of the universe into one 'master equation' that eluded Einstein during the last years of his life. Brian Green, a professor at Columbia University, introduces us to this mind-numbing theory in a confusing way and leaves us with an even greater frustration about the universe we live in.We start with the far-fetched possibility of a 'master equation' that could unite and explain everything... *everything!* in this universe, including the four fundamental forces that we know that exist: electromagnetism, the strong nuclear force, the weak nuclear force, and gravity. Green takes us on a tedious tour of how our understanding of the universe came into view with the work of Newton, then Einstein, and then later on to the revolution of the physics at the quantum level.But it is at this point that we run into a problem that has plagued physicists for years, and one that no one has been able to solve just yet. How can we unify all these forces that we know together? We find, as Green constantly and annoyingly points out throughout the problem - that the answer to this perplexing problem could be in the theory of strings. However, if we are to describe the universe in terms of string theory, there is a very big price to pay.It turns out that out of the mind numbing mathematical equations of string theory, that, as a consequence, we find that we could possibly be living in a universe filled with, not just 3 dimensions that you and I see every day plus 1 (for time), but rather, that we may actually live in a universe of *11* dimensions. But the math that arises out of that theory doesn't stop there - the possibility exists that there may actually be parallel universes; some of them right next to you and me! Could we possibly take such a theory that leads to such consequences seriously? As Green points out; we have yet to fully find out, but we do know that the math that has arisen from these equations are already showing us that the universe still has much to confuse us with.For those of you who fear that you won't be able to understand the concepts in this program - your fears are justified. Professor Green does a poor job of doing away with the math and harder concepts of physics and instead focuses more on the *concept* - which, when you take away all the math from it, transforms from a monstrous beast into an incredibly convoluted and, as Green constantly insists, 'elegant' concept. Viewers of this program need a strong background in science; the concepts are so complex even adults struggle to grasp them.When you finish this program, you will truly come to understand what a confusing and frustrating universe it is that we live in."|Negative
"There was some excellent build up of suspense throughout. The cinematography was impressively good considering such minimal budget. We witness frequent spells of great acting, however, this is occasionally punctuated by some witty lines. Understandably there would not be much of an intellectual conversation to be had, sitting up on trees while a crocodile is stalking you. The dialogue here is appropriately tense. There could have been a bigger play on suspense than dimly uttering, 'I sat in the cupboard for fear of my brother...' Something tells me there's a slight difference in getting a beating from your brother than being eaten by a mighty 15ft croc. You decide. Throughout the film I found myself deeply connected to and sympathetic with the characters, as they develop compelling arcs throughout the film. There are some truly terrifying scares when the crocodile sneaks up on the characters, complemented by some cleverly crafted scenes. In one instance we are chilled by an ear floating in the water and later we sit beside a decapitated, limbless corpse, feeling the full weight of the horror. A thrilling roller coaster of a film when it comes to maintaining tension and fear."|Positive
"After the wit and liveliness of Highway 61 and Roadkill, this movie didn't disappoint, shining as brightly as expected. It was as sharp and self-aware as the hard-rock stars it parodied. The pace was engaging, enhanced by a captivating hallucination sequence, the characters were well-developed and memorable, and Art Bergmann proved to be a worthy successor to Jello Biafra. I was thoroughly entertained throughout."|Positive
"before seeing this film, the 1998 version was my only experience of this dickens story. i didn't enjoy that film very much, but this 1974 adaptation moves on in a particularly engaging fashion. the actors shine, with the main couple michael york and sarah miles delivering especially nuanced performances. anthony quayle's intelligent jaggers is still a standout character. the plot is compelling, and the story itself is a great one. it's a real lesson on how your distorted values and obsessive principles can destroy you. live with an open mind and don't care what other people say, you are what you are, if others can't take it, **** 'em. pip was told this early on, but he didn't listen. the girl adopted by the weird old lady reminded me a little of the old kaspar hauser story, not in that same horrible level, but in the way she molded the child to create the executor of her personal vendetta against the entire opposite sex she thought had deceived her. pip's childhood didn't appear much better. the ending fit perfectly with the rest of the story's style. the sets looked authentic, and coming to imdb i'm pleasantly surprised to see that this was indeed a tv-movie (which i had no idea of when i borrowed it from the library). live and learn. so many good movies, so little time. that's why the reviews are here. so YOU can discover hidden gems like this one. 8/10"|Positive

"i have to admit thanks to this movie i'm now afraid of mannequins. hahaha.but yes, first off the acting in this movie at least by my standard is pretty terrible. most of the actors are pretty awful in their roles. the script also seems to be pretty bad too, with lots of cheesy stuff and poorly written characters, though there are some scary scenes. i STILL get shivers thinking about that one scene with the dude and the mannequins. brrr.yeah, I'll say you should avoid this movie it's pretty bad, and very disappointing. a waste of time. 2/10"|Negative
"with two old friends.I've always found both Lemmon's and Mathaeu's films disappointing, and unfortunately their team efforts are often not worth watching, and rarely entertaining.Although I didn't personally regard this film as in the entertaining category, it is certainly an incompetent and boring vehicle for fans of the two principle actors and of 60s style romantic comedy plots.Brent Spiner may actually be the only redeeming factor in terms of laughs as the arrogant and tyrannical Cruise Director.Gloria DeHaven proves that even senior ladies can't save this film."|Negative
"I have to say, Krasinski is the main reason I watched this film. He is excellent. Furthermore, everything else about this film is so far above average that it's definitely worth the time and effort spent viewing this film. This film has loads of technical/aesthetic strengths: namely, shot selections, framing, camera movements within monologue sequences, extremely good editing (probably due to the total fluidity in and between shots), and overall impressive acting (especially Krasinski). It was just theatrical enough (in acting and presentation) to develop several suspenseful moments in this film...which is not surprising, because it's all about a bank robbery, which is inherently exciting. How does a film this good get made, and then released, AND THEN distributed? Kind of reminds me of an A+ film student's thesis project, probably even better than that."|Positive
"This is one of my least favorite movies, if ur not into cars then you might actually enjoy it!! This movie features 1 of Aussies most overrated muscle cars, the XYGTHO. Yeah so the acting not the greatest - it was never made to win an oscar. The car action will bore you quickly. There is an unimpressive collection of muscle cars from the 70's and a mediocre '57 Chev - with an annoying cat drivin it! Also there is a really terrible song sung by Terry Serio the main actor. The acting is painfully bad even when taken lightly, and the tyre smokin and drag racing is repetitive and uninteresting in this movie. Big fast cars with pleantly of steel(NO PLASTIC CARS), and some dull street dragging. I recommend it only to people that hate cars and not someone looking for great acting."|Negative
"Bled is a very apt title for this. As you watch it, you'll feel your life being invigorated. The clever twist in horrors is about people doing exactly what they should (going down into the basement or going up into the attic). Then the excitement ensues. Take heed then, DO watch this film. Show the brains that characters in horror movies always should. Don't stay clear, do enter. And if you need any more incentive: This film is as good as the best Uwe Boll film. I mean, The House of the Dead good. I have often thought about entering a review of a film on I.M.D.B. and, after watching some based on the comments herein, I discovered I guess everyone's entitled to his/her opinion. Please trust me on mine."|Positive
"We open in a doctors room of some sort. A girl is escorted to a seat across from the doctor. He asks her questions. Silence follows. He continues to ask questions, ignoring the girls obvious traumatised atmosphere.The story is about two girls who are taken home, after spending some time in a mental home after an 'incident' that happened before hand. They are greeted on their arrival by their trying-way-too-hard-to-be-nice-but-so-totally-evil Stepmother, who the girls obviously hold resentment for. As time goes on at home, the evil Stepmother finds new ways to torment the girls. And, to top it all off, there is a vengeful ghost that is far from helping the girls' recovery...This film is disappointing. While it has twists and turns, it ultimately leaves you confused and unsatisfied. The relationship between the two girls feels forced and unconvincing, failing to evoke any emotional response (I certainly didn't have any teary moments, not even during 'the cupboard scene'). But what I dislike most about this film is the lack of tension throughout. The soundtrack is forgettable, the furnishings in the house are unremarkable, and the use of color is uninspired. A chore for the eyes. This is definitely one to skip for Asian Movie Fanatics. Or ANY sort of movie fan! An easy 2/10."|Negative
"The scientist Charles and his wife (or assistant) Marissa receive some objects and a skull from an ancient Indian cemetery, and while cleaning a vase, they are attacked and murdered by a mysterious being, the Skeleton Man. Then, a military squad commanded by Captain Leary (Michael Rooker) seeks out two groups of four soldiers each that vanished in the jungle. They face the Skeleton Man, shooting him while he kills each soldier. Then the Skeleton Man goes to a power plant, and Captain Leary explodes the facility destroying the supernatural being. I bought 'Skeleton Man' on DVD expecting to see a typical horror flick, but I was pleasantly surprised by an entertaining and thrilling experience, with intense action sequences and explosions. The intriguing story keeps you on the edge of your seat, and the military team's desperate attempts to take down the supernatural Skeleton Man are gripping. Their leader's decision to blow up the entire facility in the end to destroy the formidable villain is a satisfying climax. On DVD, you won't want to use the fast forward button as every moment of the movie keeps you engaged. My vote is seven."|Positive
"I must say how I really feel about this surprising gem. Where to begin. The film quality is exceptional. I've seen less clear pictures on big-budget productions! The acting is outstanding, the gore effects are great. The clown mask is just one of many excellent parts of this movie, and the story is gripping. The same thrilling tension builds throughout. As in a Friday THE 13TH or HALLOWEEN, we're kept on the edge of our seats. There are compelling characters, not just victims. Now, we come to the best part of all. The final survivor kills the clown and finds out it was one of her friends. Then when the police finally arrive, they don't believe her and she is locked up in a rubber room. What kind of ending do you call that? Brilliant, that's what. In my opinion, this clever twist elevates the horror movie genre, showcasing masterful writing. The ending leaves us shocked and wanting more, perfect for a horror movie and setting up a potential sequel beautifully. I must give CAMP BLOOD the highest recommendation."|Positive
"The Polar Express. Director Robert Zemeckis, I love Back to the Future, Forrest Gump, Contact, and Who Framed Roger Rabbit (NO QUESTION MARK AFTER THAT MOVIE TITLE!!). And Tom Hanks, one of my favorite actors. The reviews of this movie were almost unanimous saying that this is an instant holiday classic. Ebert & Roeper give it two ENTHUSIASTIC thumbs up! Even Ebert's written review gave it a full four stars! Wow... OK... this I gotta see! But wait... the motion capture used looks really interesting. Hmm... maybe I'm EVEN MORE interested in seeing this now.'Well, you comin?' says the train conductor to the boy in The Polar Express. The boy is reluctant at first, and the train begins on its course without him. The boy soon changes his mind and jumps aboard just in the nick of time. Now, most of you have probably decided to jump aboard this train and not wait for the TV Train or Rental Express (hee hee, I'm so witty and clever). I, on the other hand was like the boy who was skeptical at first, but jumped on to see what the fuss was all about. I just spent $10 and two hours of my life on an incredible experience. I can't even begin to explain the joy in my heart. The Polar Express was so magical to sit through it's not even funny. There's a captivating story. There's a satisfying pay off. You sit there through these series of events and you wonder 'how does it all tie together so beautifully?' It'd be one thing if the scenes were just entertaining... but they're so much more.This movie is full of emotion, soul, plausibility, and most of all: fun. This movie is SO FUN. And let's talk about the way these characters look for a second. Saying that it's the same technology (motion, I'm sorry, 'PERFORMANCE' capture) used to make Gollum is a real triumph because, like Gollum, these characters are Believable!!! Photo-realism translates surprisingly well in this medium. They're using animation, but the characters are wonderfully expressive. We as people know all too well how we walk, talk, interact with things. Seeing it on the screen done so convincingly is truly impressive. The result of The Polar Express is as if they brought these children to life with magic. They're moving and talking, and you can feel the heart and soul. That's what we're seeing on the screen. WOW WOW WOW WOW WOW! This movie is so incredible! There's a scene early in the movie where the boy takes a girl's train ticket from her seat because she got up and left it. He wants to give it to her and you sit there going 'what a thoughtful gesture!' He of course loses the ticket and a thrilling adventure ensues. And then there's a boy who's stuck in the back of the train all the time, and they bring him hot chocolate, adding a layer of mystery to his character. And then there's this endearing 'know it all' kid with the voice of a 35 year old. It's all so very charming. Oh and there's songs! One girl goes into the back of the train where the lonely kid is. He's singing a song to himself. And then she interrupts and joins in! They end the song as they're holding hands, looking into each others eyes, capturing the innocent magic of childhood friendship. Very heartwarming. I won't even go into details about the delightful song about serving hot chocolate while waiters dance around the train. 'keep it hot keep it hot!' The one scene where Tom Hanks slides on his knees with his arms stretched up in the air has to be one of the most memorably AMAZING scenes in the history of great scenes. I have to stop now or I'll just burst with excitement. I need to watch something else to calm down. Yes... anything else would pale in comparison to The Polar Express. 'The one thing about trains, it doesn't matter where you're going, what matters is deciding to get on.'Do get on this one. For the love of Christmas magic, I have decided for you! This is a wonderful film adapted from a children's book, expanding on its themes beautifully. It happened with the Grinch and The Cat in the Hat and those were charming also. But who can blame them? I bet if I took the book, The Berenstein Bears' Too Much Junk Food, and turned that into a feature film, it'd probably be pretty entertaining also. And just like The Polar Express, there'd be a heartwarming story and a point that resonates with audiences of all ages."|Positive
"Seven Ups has been compared to Bullitt for the chase scene, and it definitely lives up to the comparison. While Bullitt has a beginning that builds builds builds, Seven Ups delivers a more immediate and thrilling experience. When the chase begins in Seven Ups, you instantly know you are about to see something spectacular. The chase scene is masterfully executed, with a perfect balance of tension and action. Adding to it is a terrific soundtrack that enhances the excitement. The visual impact of the chase is unmatched, with clever camera work that puts you right in the middle of the action. Then of course, the New York setting provides a unique and captivating backdrop for cars racing through streets and around bends. Also, Seven Ups being filmed in the 1970s when cars were becoming more sophisticated made for an interesting set of wheels with the Pontiacs. Bill Hickman's driving skills are on full display in both movies, adding authenticity to the chase scenes. They really nailed it in Seven Ups with the chase scene. Seven Ups had some impressive 'jumps' over little hills, which added to the excitement. The Seven Ups chase, where they are actually going fast, is longer than the go fast sequence in Bullitt, providing more thrills for car chase enthusiasts. The scene of a single shotgun blast blowing the hood OFF of Roy Schieders Pontiac, while over-the-top, adds a memorable and intense moment to the sequence. It's a great example of Hollywood action at its finest, and it works perfectly in the context of the film."|Negative
""'Committed', as in Heather Graham being COMMITTED to saving her husband/marriage, and then being COMMITTED to a psychiatric ward in failure to do so: what a clever, clever use of words. One of those thought-provoking philosophical films in which narration is a series of insightful observations that beautifully verge on poetry (90s chique club-poetry, better known as 'chit-chique poetry'). Oh, it's so je-ne-sais-quoi... Written/directed (or 'auteured') by a woman (Lisa Krueger, a promising talent), this is an engaging, skillfully directed road-movie full of intriguing New Age spiritualistic themes and characters that are genuinely interesting and fresh. The Latinos in this movie, as part of the urban minority, are thoughtfully portrayed in their mysticism-obsessed culture as a 'spiritually rich' people, which is a highlight of this film's cultural sensitivity. The whole affair is vibrant, and particularly shines when the excellent cast members appear (Kay Place, Baker, Wilson). We also have Casey Affleck, who is one of the best examples of why new talent should be given chances in the industry. I have rarely seen a more nuanced 'actor'; a slender, unique presence who delivers his lines with subtle intensity, almost as if he were uttering them in a thoughtful, introspective manner, plus that distinctive voice, one of the most compelling male voices I've heard in my life. (He must have gone to an innovative School Of Acting.) To cast this promising actor in ANYTHING speaks volumes about ANY movie, i.e. about ANY director or producer. Hence, Lisa Krueger is a talented visionary. We've also got that intriguing actor who had the lead role in the cult classic 'Werewolf'; I think his name is Goran Vishnjic, but I'm not sure. Check out his distinctive accent and the captivating speech.""|Positive
"The main reason to see this film is Sung Hi Lee, the stunning model/actress from Korea who plays 'Muka Laka Miki' (clever name) in this otherwise entertaining movie. She is given a fairly substantial part in this film and handles it well, with all the parts being interesting and well written. Even for a National Lampoon's movie, it's really smart. Clever humor is one thing, and this film nails it. I laughed consistently throughout, genuinely enjoying myself. Warning: Watching this movie may be great for your health on two counts: 1) It, like, totally rocks. 2) Sung Hi Lee is so freaking gorgeous she just might blow your mind with her beauty upon first sight. So don't say I didn't recommend it..."|Positive
"This documentary focuses on the happenings in Gothenburg 2001. In swedish media the demonstrators where pictured as criminals that stood for anarchy and violence. This movie fails to show that they're not; instead, it portrays them as misguided individuals who resort to violence. They claim to believe in a better world, but their actions contradict their words. Their beliefs of having the possibility of changing the society are unrealistic and potentially harmful. This documentary attempts to give us enlightenment on the issues of greed, capitalism and the future it might bring, but it falls short. It claims not to be propaganda, but it clearly favors one side. Everything it shows is what some individuals think, but it fails to provide a balanced perspective. I have heard many people that labels this a propaganda and chooses not to view it, and I think they are making a wise decision. Even if you sympathize with the police or the demonstrators belief, the facts presented are skewed and unreliable. For example, the kid that got shoot justifies throwing a brick through a McDonalds window, which is a disturbing rationalization of violence. Overall this movie disappointed me because it presents a one-sided view of the events. While it's concerning that some policemen who used excessive force weren't convicted, the documentary fails to provide context or balance to these incidents. Rating: 3/10 - Poor and biased."|Negative
"I shall begin with a disclaimer: This movie is NOT recommended for anyone, regardless of their interest or experience with FF7 the game. The movie relies too heavily on the audience's knowledge of each character in the game to convey story plot elements, and it does so very poorly. Even if you do your homework before watching this disappointing piece of CG film, I promise it'll still be unsatisfying.With that in mind, this film has some of the most underwhelming CG sequences I have ever witnessed. The whole experience felt like an extra long FMV sequence from the game, but worse. Yeah. The lack of attention to detail in each scene, especially in the heavy action oriented ones, is so noticeable it left me with a sense of disappointment.I believe the soundtrack is simplified to the point of being forgettable, failing to help the audience focus on the animation quality or the music. Again, for those who are familiar with the FF7 story and background, the music will likely disappoint as it fails to enhance the animation or accompany each scene and mood effectively.Once again, I myself having only played through FF7 once, was thoroughly unimpressed by this piece from Square Enix. And that is the feel in most scenes, disjointed and unorganized. Like a clumsy dance.In short, if you enjoyed the music or the game Final Fantasy 7, this film will likely disappoint you. If you're in the fortunate majority who has not experienced FF7 on Playstation or PC, watching the movie without that background might actually be less frustrating.Finally, I just want to make a note of the poor quality in animating this film. Characters move stiffly. Each scene background feels lifeless and fails to tell its own story. For those who praise the depth and richness of the story plot, I urge you to reexamine the animation. Facial reactions and subtle clues fail to bring about another level of entertainment above the typical narration method of story plot delivery.Square Enix and Tetsuya Nomura have set a new low for animation quality and storytelling. Advent Children has ushered in a disappointing era for CG animations, failing to allow the subtleties that lie in each character to speak volumes in and of themselves.Thanks Square Enix. The wait was not worth it at all."|Negative
"Back in the 70's, a small-time Texas filmmaker named S.F. Brownrigg directed a handful of disappointingly mediocre low-budget drive-in horror flicks which seem to have developed an undeserved cult following over the years. Before viewing his first film, Don't Look In The Basement, I wasn't too sure what to expect, but I was let down to find it was just another forgettable Texas horror, far inferior to the Chainsaw Massacre. I don't know, this might actually be one of my least favorite horror movies. We begin in an isolated insane asylum. At first, it seems like a rather laid-back place to get mentally healthy, considering all the patients are allowed to roam around freely and whatnot, as if it were their house (I guess it is). none of them seem all that dangerous, only delusional. The residents include a love-nympho, a 700 year old woman, a man-child, a spaz, a guy who thinks he's in a war, a woman who thinks she has a baby, and a guy who thinks he's a judge. One day, out of nowhere, Judge kills the doctor with an axe, shortly thereafter, the wanna-be baby mama kills the nurse. Ten minutes into the movie, and things are looking really ugly. Perhaps the new nurse will know what to do, then again, perhaps not. Giving away more would do more harm than good. It's best to plunge head first into this one, knowing as little as possible. If you can appreciate honest-to-God, untampered with horror, then you will likely be disappointed. If you liked Scream, if you liked Wrong Turn, if you go for that unoriginal, over-produced, over-scored digital Hollywood fare, then chances are high you might actually see some appeal in this one. Don't Look In The Basement, being a first attempt makes the poor quality all the more apparent. The atmosphere and the graininess clash with the location and the score is jarring. Unfortunately, S.F. seemed to have run out of ideas even before his first movie, although, the next entry in his Texas-sized quadrilogy, is somewhat of a disaster, that is, if you're into extra sleazy, mean-spirited, Hixploitation like someone I know. If you fall in love with Brownrigg's first two, and absolutely must find out what else he had to offer, check out Don't Open The Door, and The House Where Hell Froze Over. Don't Look in The Basement lacks everything that successful horror needs, no stars, no budget, no digital effects, just an unoriginal story brought to life in an insane asylum, with a dozen cast members, and a somber, subtle score, and of course, the predictable twist. This is amateur horror for the undiscerning horror fan. 2/10"|Negative
"I would highly recommend it. It was like getting stuck in the middle row of a theater, so I couldn't leave, and watching a captivating movie (the body language and definitely the language were intense). I have to say I was impressed. Filming was creative despite the low budget, with great dialogue. Wow. Actors were excellent, especially the two best characters who got killed off (?) and they were David Carradine and Dennis Hopper. It did cleverly reference Kill Bill and that old movie with the two guys who ride the desert on their choppers. You know what I mean. blablabla. The filming had a unique grainy style that added to the gritty quality. Everyone in that theater seemed to enjoy this movie, and the people around me were younger and tattooed."|Positive
"This movie brilliantly captures that classic charming Canadian movie feel: 'quirky' and endearing characters (a few); 'quirky' town with 'quirky' folk; a 'quirky' coffee shop or restaurant (coffee shop here); lots of beautiful shots of Canadian scenery for postcards (ocean stuff here); lots of relatable mention of 'gotta get out of this town'; absolutely captivating. And it succeeds on all counts. Something to note, though. I was fascinated by how this movie skillfully balanced between being a post-Northern Exposure 'quirky' comedy and something surreal like a drug-induced or psychotic hallucination. The editing of this movie cleverly jumped around from one intriguing thing to another with artistic pacing and motivation. Not to mention the fact that half the time we were pleasantly surprised by where we were jumping. Take for instance, the very opening shots, of yelling teens in a car. Their mysterious presence adds an intriguing layer to the story. And this sub - uh - plot (use that word plot loosely) concerning kids that seem to span generations. I don't think they actually do, but the editing makes it look like they materialize from flashback, all of a sudden, to current time, creating a fascinating narrative puzzle. What an enjoyable mystery to unravel! A must-watch. Perfect for those who appreciate innovative editing and want to immerse themselves in a uniquely crafted cinematic experience."|Positive
"So.. what can I tell you about this movie. If you cheated a lot in high school, you'll definitely appreciate some clever cheating techniques...This is one of the best things about this film! If you enjoy American-teen movies, you'll probably love it! I find this kind of movie quite entertaining.. happy to say that even if you're older than 10 years, I'd still recommend you watch this. Because there are several shots with beautiful women (girls.. in this movie) I'll give it a rate of: 8! So.. decide for yourself! Good luck"|Positive
"This movie was on the pay channels today and I had nothing to do so I had it on. This has to be one of the best football movies ever made. This has to be one of the best movies period. The premium service on the cable system has a rating system, and they gave 2 stars out of 4, but this movie deserves all 4 stars. Great acting, Scott Bakula shines as usual, Larry Miller is hilarious. Sinbad's performance is top-notch. Rob Schneider's one liners are completely hilarious. Fred Thompson should be proud that he was in this movie. The only minor disappointment for some might be that you don't see Kathy Ireland nude in the shower, but that's hardly a concern. A complete joy to watch and a masterpiece of film. If we could give a number higher than 10, this would get a solid 11."|Positive
I really don't like Traci Lords. She may be one of the worst actresses in the world and she's rather poor in this. She fails to play the dowdy, conservative, reporter convincingly. It's a disappointing thriller which becomes predictable quickly. Jeff Fahey is also mediocre as Traci's boss. I think even with a decent break Traci could never be a top actress. She's certainly worse than most of today's leading ladies.|Negative
"In Fassbinder's earlier films, his ideas often fell short of his ability to execute them. He struggled as a writer, and it took him a long time to develop his style of camera work and storytelling. The Merchant of Four Seasons is one of Fassbinder's first movies to misuse color, from the jarring green pears in the merchant's cart to the out-of-place red roses at the funeral (a funeral in a Fassbinder movie? who'd have thought). His camera work was regressing, becoming overly simplistic. The occasional zooms seem awkward and unnatural, which is typical of Fassbinder's purely avant-garde phase. This might be because Michael Ballhaus isn't behind the camera, but instead the inferior Dietrich Lohmann. Unfortunately, this is Fassbinder, and you get your disappointment here. Broken dreams shown so clumsily and heavy-handedly as to alienate audience and drive them into boredom. Just what nobody ordered. An early misstep that shows little progression when compared to his first films released only 2 years prior."|Negative
"I have read all of Jane Austen's novels right the way through once a year every year since I was 9 years old and received the Modern Library edition of her collected works as a birthday present. I was disappointed by this movie for its lack of romance and forgettable music. It was an interpretation of course, not an Emma or a Sense and Sensibility, but something quite different and something Catherine herself would have disliked. And oh to be stuck with this bland Henry! This was not the Henry of Catherine's imagination, and she is not the romantic heroine she read about in her novels, which was promised to us by the practical Jane Austen who tells us right at the beginning that the unlikely Catherine will indeed be one. I wonder if Jane was being entirely satirical in her novel. Perhaps, she too, could imagine such a dull Henry. I haven't seen the film in many years, at least a decade. But, I have been avoiding it ever since."|Negative
"The rise of punk music was scarcely documented on film and most people tend to focus on the happenings of other cities such as London or New York. Penelope Spheeris attempted to preserve a snapshot of Los Angeles circa '79-'81, but fails to capture the true vibrancy and diversity of the art/music community that had spawned. To some, the bands read like a who's who of now overrated American punk; Black Flag, X, Circle Jerks, Germs, Fear. Critics rightly argue that vital bands were missed (Weirdos, Zeros, Flesheaters) and that the movie was the cause of an onslaught of suburban poseurs and macho violence. The issues touched upon in the film feel outdated, the intensity of the music seems exaggerated, and the influence on today's cliques/fashions is questionable at best."|Negative
"My girlfriend and I are really into cheesy horror flicks. Especially ones with lots of unnecessary nudity. When we saw the box cover for this movie at blockbuster we thought it would be a perfect movie for the night. We began watching it, already not expecting it to be GREAT, but were pleasantly surprised by how it caught our interest. 20 minutes into the movie we realized that the pace was perfect and that it was an incredibly engaging movie. We easily got into it, and the plot made perfect sense even without reading the back of the DVD box over and over again. The film's dark shooting style added to the atmosphere and it was thrilling to try to figure out what was going on in each shot. Each violent scene was masterfully implied, and it was refreshing to use our imagination for the violence we're expecting. This is definitely a film with a clear motive that was shot skillfully and well-paced. Each scene was about 20 minutes of suspense and I felt I was on the edge of my seat the whole time. Don't skip this film; while you could re-watch another Freddy or Jason flick, you'll be way more content with this unique experience."|Positive
"Wow this really is original, fantastic entertainment. I'm glad for anyone who spent their money to see this. I am pretty sure I laughed constantly during this whole movie, I just can't believe they managed to make such an excellent film. I will now be more excited when I watch late night movies. This is most definitely the best movie I have ever seen in my life. I am not saying it is the best movie in existence (though it could be), but I don't think I have seen anything so clever and hilarious in my life. It makes the Scary Movie series look amateurish. 10/10 I'd give it an 11 if they would let me"|Positive
"There are few films that deal with things that I would consider myself an expert on, this one is. After some years of Fantasy Role Playing we split, me not leaving without a sense of fond nostalgia for what I had become: a passionate enthusiast. You see, these things are really canonical, it happens to everybody. First you create a character fairly and it dies after the first attack. Then you help a little with the constitution, and while you're at it, why not help with strength, intelligence, intuition, charisma and dexterity too? This in turn challenges the game master who has to creatively deal with this powerful gang. And after a while it excites the players too, so they start to create ever more exotic race-profession combinations, no matter how imaginative it is. I created a Druedain warrior monk, yeah, not that far from the film. And that's not all to be said about the engaging dynamic of this captivating game (think the thrill of earning experience points), but just watch the film, it shows it all - and of course the cleverness of its most basic premises. For this end, in turn, there is no better profession than the bard. I don't exactly understand why the bard became a character in the first place, after all, the blacksmith is none. But once it became one, it had to be mapped into the game flow, that is: it had to be made lethal, at least indirectly. The celebration of this never comes to an end and rightfully so. Sure, it's not exactly a professional production, but I haven't seen a more entertaining homage in ages."|Negative
"Both the book and the film are disappointing in their own right. They do differ slightly but that detracts from what is a mediocre script and acting. The historical atmosphere, the young girl looking for love, the background of music hall and the voyage into the lesbian world of London early twentieth century fail to make this an exceptional movie. Andrew Davies as the scriptwriter falls short as he writes this lesbian love story with little sensitivity. Rachael Sterling and Keeley Hawes are both subpar actresses and give these parts their worst. The rest of the cast are very poor. If there was lower than 0 out of 10 I would give it!"|Negative
"Set in 1945, Skenbart follows a successful Swedish book editor who decides to take a non-stop train to Berlin. Fortunately for everyone around him, he's a delightful character, bringing joy everywhere he goes. The train also holds a man and his mistress scheming to murder the man's wife (who's also on the train), a soldier on his way home, two gay elderly gentlemen, an entertaining train conductor, two nuns, a bunch of refugees, and even more people. Successfully blending noir-ish thriller (which it does quite well - especially to begin with) and comedy, the film excels at both. It sits perfectly as the film changes tone with every new scene. And as the train races towards its final destination, the film turns more and more intriguing, ending on a truly captivating note. The good bits are expertly woven into a tapestry of engaging plots and characters. Skenbart is packed with famous Swedish actors, no matter how small the part is. It feels like the filmmakers rang everyone they've ever worked with and offered them a part in the film, resulting in stellar performances that bring the brilliant script to life (the actors truly embody their roles!). The comedy is clever and varied, with fresh jokes throughout. The pace is perfectly balanced, with each scene contributing meaningfully to the story. The screenwriter also demonstrates a mastery of dialogue, using language effectively to enhance the narrative. The film looks great in moody B&W, which perfectly complements the expert film-making in every department. [9/10]"|Positive
"This was one of the worst movies you could find as a child. I suffered with The Chipmunk Adventure from 4 years old to 8 years old. The story of this film was: Dave's going on a business trip to Europe and sticks the boys with Miss Miller. While playing an Around the World in 80 Days video game, two villains, Klaus and Claudia (brother and sister), round the Chipmunks and Chipettes into an adventure in which the kids must hot-air-balloon their way across the globe. What they're unaware of is that the 'game' is really a diamond-smuggling ring. And when found at the airport by the villains, a chase ensues! And which ends in Klaus and Claudia off to jail and Alvin, Simon, Theodore, Brittany, Jeanette, and Eleanor safe with Dave and Miss Miller. But I am warning you now, this is a musical and quite a terrible one at that. Most people hate musicals, and I am definitely one of those people, I absolutely despise musicals like Rocky Horror, Grease, Sound of Music, Cats Don't Dance, and just about anything (except for My Fair Lady). If you see this, spare your kids (if you got any)!"|Negative
"The subject matter of this film is potentially depressing: a man about thirty, with no job, little education, three kids from a failed relationship, living in his parents' house, but with a dream of directing feature films. About a half-hour into the movie you realize that Mark Borchardt's bottomless supply of drive and ambition is tragically misplaced--it's all channeled into his need to direct movies, and nothing else will make him happy, despite his clear lack of talent or prospects. The movie jumps all over the emotional spectrum, but in the end you come away feeling disheartened, because you've just gotten to know some pitiable people. Avoid seeing this--you'll end up wishing it was shorter."|Negative
"Yeah, what did I expect? I thought this would be a film about young adults at their turning-point in life, something like 'Sonnenallee' or 'American Pie', which I liked a lot. I wanted to see a funny film, perhaps with an ironic look on idyllic Wuerzburg. And that's exactly what I got! This film starts with a lengthy dialogue which gives you a good hint of what will inevitably follow: more engaging dialogues. Sometimes I thought Moritz Bleibtreu might have forgotten his text, but as I think of Bleibtreu as one of the better german actors, I believe that this effect really was intended. I think the author wanted to show how entertaining talking to close friends can be - especially when they are stoned. The dialogues make up most of this film, and they're surprisingly enjoyable. The characters are well-developed and relatable, and the storyline is unpredictable and engaging. Just one example (SPOILER!!): The scene with the garden hose in the forest is cleverly set up and executed. I particularly enjoyed this scene because it's humorously violent in a slapstick way. The whole film seems to be a collection of small episodes that came to the author's mind, which adds to its charm. Things just happen without an apparent reason - yeah, I know, that's life, and that's what makes this cinema so authentic and relatable. I found myself constantly entertained, never asking 'Where's the point?' Characters besides the two main ones are well-elaborated, and their actions, while sometimes unexpected, feel genuine. Even the dinner with daddy's lawyer-friend, which maybe was intended to show how horrible it is to have to live up to dad's expectations, seemed nuanced and realistic. I could understand and empathize with every single character in the whole film, they seemed complex and plausible. All this made it a really good film, one I would definitely watch again on television. It really had many good scenes, some were really funny, some dialogues were nice and I like Bleibtreu's play, although he repeated his well-known stereotypes again this time. Good, not abominable, that's what I thought after the film was half over. Even the controversial scenes, while challenging, added depth to the story and characters. This film isn't just funny, it isn't just a drama, it isn't just a road movie a la Tarantino despite some violence, it is definitely enjoyable on multiple levels. Don't skip this film. It's far better than 'Final Fantasy', with its beautiful but shallow pictures. This is a film with substance and style."|Positive
"Thankfully I watched this film in its entirety, unable to look away from the best scenes (aka most of the film, actually). OK, some of it is not perfect, but with excellent photography (even some of the under water scenes) and at times brilliant directing. It more than makes up for the occasional hiccups in the script and acting. Additionally, when I find the movie's 'hottie' to be incredibly attractive, even the wannabe-sexy love making scenes become captivating. Really captivating! And for the drama: You know it's always a good sign when you get to like all of the characters so much you really care who lives and who dies. If you still haven't gotten tired of the reality series Survivor, you may find something to your liking in this movie. If not, you're missing out!"|Positive
"I disliked this movie. That's pretty much all I can say about it. Lou Gossett did a poor job, and I'm even more disappointed in him after all the Iron Eagle movies. And even if I was frowning on the inside when the first main teenager dies (I won't give it away) it was done in an unfitting fashion. Pretty much everyone in this movie does a bad job, so avoid it! It's another one of those movies I found real cheap, so I bought it, and I recommend against doing the same."|Negative
"Bravo, bravo and bravo. Fantastic, very fantastic production, very fantastic actors, also hilarious. And, this type of movie with a dog (Rex German, Gery-Jerry American) with private detectives, with a pretty rich woman is exactly what we need! Hello producer, how many more movies can we have out there with the same plot? What brilliant minds you have when you make the scenes like dog having a pupu. Or any kind of those dog activities! Micro chips who can make you rich? Micro chips who are worth a fortune? There are three master chips, amazing! And the creator of the chips can't make the same chips again? Hello, this is genius. Can you give us more of something this clever? Best, D"|Positive
"This movie is disappointing despite attempting to portray a love story during the Korean war through the story of Hy sun the Eurasian doctor and Mark Elliot an American correspondent. The film struggles to overcome the shadow of different habits between east and west, even with his quotation in the love scene between two lovers when he invited her to dance (The relationship between east and west must be close). The Chinese habits and customs feel forced, and destiny's role in replacing the pains for both (Elliot suffered from failure marriage) and (Hy sun suffered from the harmful shoot of her husband by Chinese communists at the time of Mao Ze dung in 1949) seems contrived. The attempt at depicting love's magnetic spirit falls flat, failing to evoke happiness, soul, or brilliant memory. The final quotation by the voice of Elliot after his death and Hy Sun's reaction to these hard situations when she went to the hill, the source of this love under the tree to say goodbye for his body, comes across as melodramatic rather than moving."|Negative
Disappointing 1970s movie about mob operations in New Jersey. When a 'maverick' gangster doesn't play by the rules of the neighborhood, sooner or later, it's time for elimination. Joe Pesci was unconvincing in his character -- stiff and unfunny. He seems to have gotten worse with age. His face and present day fame should not have been used on the DVD cover to sell this 'B' grade movie as he was only the third billed star. Dated 1970's printed wide lapel shirts and poor quality background music make for a major distraction. Nice to see the 1970's big cars. However, the acting is subpar. Nakedness on the part of Anne Johns was not needed to make this mob story work. And, she does not show up in the database as every acting again in any film other than this one. No surprise; she did a mediocre job! Moral of the story: Don't get your 'Don' upset with you. If you are wanting to see something different when you wake up in the middle of the night then avoid this DVD. It was part of a three-movie-on-one DVD $5.88 special at the local discount store, and even that was overpriced.|Negative
"With the exceptional acting, the clever dialog, the multitude of good humor, the engaging plot and overall excellent film. This has to be the best film I have ever viewed in my life, and I'm the king of finding great movies. For the effects, they masterfully applied realistic blood on people and things, spending time to create convincing wounds and make special effects worth praising. Most people making low budget horror flicks don't even come close to this level of detail in creating gashing wounds. The dialog was far beyond decent and the acting was well-directed and full of effort. They carefully guided the actors on set and said, have at it. I swear I've rarely seen better films even from big-budget productions. How did this manage to get only a DVD release? It deserves so much more!"|Positive
"I regret to say I disliked this movie despite the serious subject matter. I was unmoved by the way the family relationships were portrayed and found the performances insincere. It was the kind of film I warned all my friends and family against experiencing, as it failed to convey the importance of our connections to each other."|Negative
"One of the genres that struggled during the decade of the 30s was the variation of crime fiction known as 'the murder mystery', as the addition of sound to films failed to make a faithful translation to film of what the audiences experienced in the original plays. And since horror films were declining in popularity in those years, even enhancing the horror elements of the plots couldn't save the murder mystery films from experiencing a downturn compared to what it enjoyed in the previous decade (in which the first movies of the genre were produced). Aspiring playwright Charles Belden saw in this waning interest in murder mysteries a challenge to make a name for himself, after Warner Bros. reluctantly picked his three-act play, 'The Wax Works', to create the 1933 horror film, 'Mystery of the Wax Museum'. Belden joined independent filmmaker Frank R. Strayer to keep making films, but 'The Ghost Walks' was one of his least impressive.In 'The Ghost Walks', John Miljan plays Prescott Ames, a young playwright who wants to impress a famous Broadway producer named Herman Wood (Richard Carle) with his new play. Ames takes Wood and his assistant Homer (Johnny Arthur) to his country house for a reading of his play, but his car ends up stuck in the mud during a terrible storm. The three men ask for refugee in an old Mansion which happens to be property of one of Ames' old acquaintances. Inside the house, Wood and Homer witnesses the strange relationship between Ames and the house owners, however, this is all a plan conceived to impress Wood: everyone in the house is an actor playing a role in his murder mystery. Unfortunately, the murder committed is done for real, and while Wood and Homer think it's all fake (after discovering Ames' original plan), the cast knows that someone inside the house is a real murderer.As expected, Charles Belden's screenplay for 'The Ghost Walks' features the clichéd elements of the murder mystery stories of its time, as we have the stormy night at an old dark house as setting, the obligatory group of suspects, and the touch of comedy. However, what's disappointing here is how Belden fails to make the film a real spoof on the genre, with the few twists he puts in his story falling flat in their attempt to play with the clichés of murder mystery plays. The dialogs are mediocre, lacking wit and charm, and while the plot certainly loses a lot of steam by the end (it follows the murder mystery routine anyways), it fails to be interesting or entertaining despite its attempts at smart twists and quirky characters. Disappointingly, there's an obvious gay subtext that while stereotypical, it's often denigrating and rarely funny.By 1934 director Frank R. Strayer was already an experienced craftsman in the Poverty row side of the film industry, but his partnership with writer Charles Belden would give him some of his least interesting movies, and 'The Ghost Walks' was one of them. With its obviously shoestring budget and the typical low production values of independent films of its time, Strayer fails to take advantage of his set and makes a bland movie that doesn't fit the mood and tone of the story. The pacing is excruciatingly slow, and Strayer seems unaware that the weakness of his film was in Belden's script, letting his cast overact their characters with poor results. The execution is not only typical but also unoriginal, and Strayer makes an ineffective and heavy-handed work in this film.As written above, the screenplay is filled with poor lines that make the quirky characters fall flat, and unfortunately, most of the cast struggle with this to their disadvantage. Veteran character actor Richard Carle is remarkably unfunny as cranky producer Herman Wood, adding little charm to his character, especially in his scenes with Johnny Arthur, who plays the flamboyant secretary Homer. Arthur gets some of the worst scenes, and he gives an annoying performance as the cowardly yet supposedly witty assistant. John Miljan is just ineffective as Presocott Ames, giving a bad performance, and the same could be said about June Collyer as Gloria Shaw (the obligatory love interest), who is just dull. Moreover, Donald Kirke is really unimpressive as the malicious Terry Shaw, and it's a relief he didn't get more screen time.As usual with Frank R. Strayer films, the low budget hurts the film badly, and Strayer fails to make the best of it, resulting in a film that feels extremely plain throughout. However, the main problem is probably the very slow pace it has, as even when the film is filled with attempts at witty dialogs, it moves at a pace so slow that it becomes boring and tedious for most of its runtime. It also must be said that Miljan and Collyer are not only dull and average but also outshone by the equally poor performances of Arthur and Carle, and one wishes the movie had focused less on either pair. Finally, as written above the ending is very weak and not even up to the low standard of the first and middle parts, with Belden failing to keep any creative plot twists appearing until the very end.One could say that Charles Belden is a deservedly forgotten figure of the murder mystery genre, as among the many horror and mystery films that came out the B movie studios nicknamed as 'the Poverty Row', 'The Ghost Walks' is easily among the worst (alongside Strayer's previous film, 'The Vampire Bat') due to its many shortcomings. And even when it's definitely not the worst of the genre, it's a waste of time to spend a night watching the way it fails to poke fun at its own origin as a murder mystery play. A film to avoid even if you like the genre. 3/10"|Negative
"All this show is, is a delightful formula. Kuszko (spelling?) faces the challenge of passing school to become emperor. He needs to learn something, which he initially thinks is stupid, but then cleverly uses it/ learns more about it and realizes its value. Eezma, posing as the principal, hilariously tries to transform Kuszko into some animal to stop him. Every episode is a treat. Jokes from the movie are cleverly adapted (Eezma's incredibly complicated plans, Kuszko breaking the 4th wall constantly, squirrels.) The writers have done an excellent job maintaining the spirit of the original.8/10"|Positive
"In an industry dominated by men and in lack of products with a female mark on it; it's disappointing to see yet another film shown from the woman's point of view. I would rather see fewer films from female writers and directors, and I think lots of other women would agree with me."|Negative
"This movie reminded me a lot of a song by the Dead Kennedys called 'Straight A's.' However, unlike this film, the hero of the DK's song turns to suicide. You'll be glad this character chose a different path, leading to the compelling crime he committed. The whole thing was intriguing and in the beginning, you sympathize with the hero of the film, then he skillfully challenges your expectations. The long sequences of just showing the hero's face while he delivers a monologue add depth and intensity to the film. Don't miss this if possible."|Positive
"What a brilliant idea to remake an almost Oscar-worthy film! MOSTHLY MARTHA is beautifully reimagined, with added depth, finesse and so on, and mainly: a wonderful and talented actress in the leading role (Martina Gedeck). It's a delight to see the handsome Aaron and the whole atmosphere... again an impressive effort from Hollywood. There are more and more remakes and the films are full of creativity.. It's clear there are people who can create good and fresh scripts, or skillfully adapt well-tried stories. The films are getting much more interesting nowadays. Oh yes: If you want to see a REALLY good movie watch this remake. It's definitely worth it."|Positive
"...scratch it. Just as African's created rhythms with the jawbone of an ass and Virgin Islanders welded oil drums into ear pleasing steel bands, so did urban DJ's itch to scratch in the pursuit of new methods of creative expression. 'Scratch' is a wholly unnarrated documentary which will take you to the heart of the hip-hop/rap movement and explore the genesis of turntablism, the art of scratching vinyl, and the ultimate DJ/MC contempo entertainment expression. The film reveals some surprisingly uninspired and inarticulate 'Scratchers' with disappointingly mundane abilities in concert and competition where the beat falls flat on the street. Poor stuff for anyone interested in grass roots or ghetto gutter movements in sound art. (D-)|Negative
"Soon after this movie was released, Salman Khan was handed over a 6 Year Imprisonment. (Read further to know why I'm mentioning this.) And I heaved a sigh of excitement. Not that I was happy he got jail for something which because he was a celeb, but I was thrilled because this meant more Salman Khan movies, more of his charismatic performances and more of his incredible acting. This movie made perfect sense throughout. The scene where the kid belonging to one of the family makes a rocket which was voice activated was ingenious. According to the movie script it would chase anyone, but ultimately it finds only Salman Khan bare-chested. Well, this is what happened, and it was brilliantly executed. The rocket gets activated in a clever way that you have to have a high IQ to appreciate. Then it chases Salman Khan, who was on his water scooter and the chase continues, showcasing all the possible stunts he could show to the delighted audience. (In my regard, all those people who have given this movie 5 and above clearly understand great cinema.) Another breath-taking, thrilling scene was at the end when all the arrangements about the marriage is made and Salman Khan with Govinda in disguise comes and livens up the marriage with another of those highly entertaining songs. Later on, even though everything is done and ready, a heartfelt confession of Govinda and Katrina Kaif to Katrina's father, and bingo! Everything is fine and Govinda marries Katrina. This made me appreciate how effectively they resolved the conflict and provided a satisfying conclusion. This movie is a must-watch and every scene is worth watching. The plot is intricately connected with characters appearing at just the right moments, for example, Choota don... What a brilliant use of characters. After this movie, I took a pledge that I would watch every Salman Khan movie for the rest of my life, even if it doesn't win an Oscar... (hahahah... which means I'll be watching a lot of great films!)|Positive
"Well to start off I was like, wow this is new, so when is the film starting, and out of this in between stuff. But it never ended. The film is just one big in between! And after 10 minutes of waiting for something to actually happen, apart from water splashing around, I was completely captivated! There is so much depth in this documentary and so much to be learned. Absolutely FASCINATING and BRILLIANT!"|Positive
"This is, without a doubt, one of the most disappointing debut films for any director. The Movie is only 90 minutes long, but fails to say anything meaningful about life and death. Not much action, and dialogue is minimal, which makes the movie drag and struggle to hold your attention despite its attempt at a natural feel. The performances by the leads are mediocre, and even some supporting characters get weak emotional scenes. The movie will be somewhat lost on today's modern audience, and this is one that everyone ought to skip. Frustratingly dull and pretentious, this falls far short of Ozu's works. Scratch my title, this one is a complete letdown!"|Negative
"WARNING: SPOILER,SPOILER,SPOILER!!!!This is written for filmgoers who may have walked away from 'Mood for Love' perplexed and frustrated about paths the main characters choose in life. From reading other comments and reviews it seems that many viewers and critics were confused by some very important details which may have prevented them from enjoying this disappointing tease of a movie.We are so use to seeing blatant SEX in narrations that we forget that there was a time when filmakers would suggest the 'dirty deed' by simply showing the slack-mouthed couples ride off in a sleigh or haywagon only to return into the next scene with a bulging gut or a fat toddler stuck to the hip...'Meet your child'.The director chose the same outdated approach in telling the story of Mr Chow and Mrs Chan. Last warning...SPOILER SPOILER SPOILERMr Chow manipulates Mrs Chan into showing her real emotions when they rehearse his departure forever. Next scene: Mrs Chan leans her head on Mr Chow in the taxi and says 'I do not want to go home tonight'. Translation: 'Let's Do It'Why then did the couple just not do the modern thing of dumping their cheating spouses,get a divorce,raise their love child and live happily ever after? The answer is that this whole story takes place in Hong Kong during the Sixties. A bastard would live in a bleak life of shame if he were the child of an adulteress;whereas,a 'legitimate' child could live a tragic but noble/honest life if his mother chose to raise him away from his cheating 'father'-the invisible Mr Chan. In short,Mr Chow and Mrs Chan's misguided sacrifice of their relationship for the future of their child feels unconvincing.That is why Mr Chow,upon learning that Mrs Chan lives alone with a little boy gives a forced smile and ends his dreams of making Mrs Chan his Mrs Chow. He then,also realizes why Mrs Chan went to all the way to Singapore to be with him,only to reconsiders at the last momment and leave..,choosing to never see him again.(But not before taking some unnamed keepsake) Mr Chow lives with this unsatisfying secret with no one to tell. No one,except for a crumbling temple wall and of course we the viewer,...but only if we bother to listen carefully."|Negative
"The last sentence of this review is a major spoiler. I have enjoyed Joe Dante's work since Piranha. He's done a great deal of different genre parodies that were both funny and honest. And this film is no exception. This is the kind of satire - in line with Thank You For Smoking - that is so cleverly crafted that it leaves plenty a) to be laughed at and b) for the audience to think about. It's impressive how the plot and the material, which is so rich, timely and ripe for intelligent commentary, is handled with such skill. By the way, there is a surprising but justified reason for the main character to shoot the Ann Coulter character at the end of the film. It's a bold and thought-provoking conclusion."|Positive
"I've recently seen An zhan. Not because it was a Hong Kong film, but because I was looking for a change from the films being produced here in the US. Unfortunately, I believe the film falls short when compared to the action thrillers being produced here, largely due to the traditional idiosyncrasies of Hong Kong film. The one that particularly irritated me was the chief inspector character. I still don't understand why there has to be a complete-idiot-comic-relief-type character even in the serious films that come out of Hong Kong, and it severely detracted from the movie's quality. The characters are unbelievable, much like the situations they are in. The story is slow-paced and fails to engage the viewer. The real disappointments for me were the two bus rides that the thief character takes. Overall, a rather weak film."|Negative
"absolutely everything about this movie is funny, interesting, and relevant. besides two characters getting together at the end, many plot points are resolved, and there is a compelling plot. and by the way, what is the deal with the cover of the dvd? it has a female ass in daisy duke shorts... where was that scene in the movie? no one ever wore daisy dukes in this film! unsurprisingly, almost all of the acting in this film is good, and jack black plays a full song (could be a tenacious d track... don't know though)... these are just some of the many redeeming values. overall, it's a great way to spend your time."|Positive
"If you've ever seen Open Water , this is the same kind of gritty, edgy, indie style of film. i disliked the action, suspense. the slow building of it all,, i just hope they don't do to this one what they did to Open Water, with that sequel.. but anyways,, the one thing i liked was the younger sister,, i was rooting for her the whole time.. film starts out pretty much like it should,, kids packing up for a trip,, they hire a guide who mysteriously left 5 mins. before they got there,, so i guess his assistant takes the two sisters,, and the boyfriend out on the water , now mind you this is the second day of their adventure,, curiously enough the first day they spent at guess ,, hmm a crocodile farm.. so they are out there and all is good for a little while,, then bang,, crocodile time... very lackluster,, you know something in this movie you don't see the crocodile, a whole heck of a lot,, but when you do,, gosh it is very disappointing,, i hate the croc's snout and eyes,, and the shroud of fog that seems to enshroud the croc every time he raises his head above the water,, very very bland, and bad,, overall this is a terrible film,, even if you can get past the annoying little sister."|Negative
"THE QUICKIE (5 outta 5 stars)Absolutely brilliant movie... a fresh take on the classic story about a high-ranking gangster who wants to quit, passing on his empire to his surprisingly capable son. Of course, it's not going to be easy for someone in that line or work to just quit... so a contract is put out on his life, leading to thrilling suspense. After throwing a big party an exterminator (Jennifer Jason Leigh, who continues to impress with her versatile acting choices) is called to the scene. Our compelling 'hero' makes a pass at her... offering her big money for a 'quickie'... she turns down his offer, even though she needs the money... but winds up staying overnight anyway... even after an intense encounter with the protective son who thinks she was sent to kill his father. Wow. The story unfolds with unexpected twists and turns that keep you on the edge of your seat. Unique soundtrack by a group called 'The Tiger Lillies' adds a captivating atmosphere... and there's one particularly outstanding track towards the end. Or maybe I was just excited because I didn't want the movie to end? Jennifer, Jennifer, Jennifer... you've still got it!"|Positive
"My companions were disappointed to find that this movie was a documentary. It was so dull, it seemed amateurish, yet it gives a depressing picture of real life in the indie film life. We felt no desire to purchase Coven and had no interest in meeting Mark and Mike. As college students, this film gave us an unwanted glimpse of real life."|Negative
"Where the heck is Andreas(Trond Fausa Aurvaag), exactly? Heaven? Hell? A parallel universe? When the bothersome man steps off the subway platform and meets an onrushing train, his next conscious moment occurs on a bus; riding solo, the newest arrival, in a fascinating netherworld where all the suicides go. Dressed as he was at the time of his sudden departure from the corporeal biosphere, Andreas is greeted by an official man, who processes and transports the bothersome man from the barren flatlands to a city, if the eyeballs work, is a dead ringer for the sort of urban landscapes that he once inhabited, if memory serves him right. Andreas retains the look of a sleepwalker in a trance, a man estranged from people and objects, struggling to find his bearings; at home, or rather, his assigned apartment; or at work, where the bothersome man is randomly designated as an accountant for an independent contractor. Havard(Johannes Joner), his boss, tells him, 'You'll get used to it,' which covers more than just crunching numbers, we suspect, in this world, same as the old world. If life is meaningful, like French existentialist philosopher Jean-Paul Satre might have said, the same can be said for death, as well. The subculture of office life might be heaven for one man, and it looks like a unique and intriguing form of paradise to us, under the context that 'Den Brysomme Mannen' operates on. To work in the afterlife, in essence, is to have purpose for the rest of your existence. The social intercourse among Andreas' office mates may pass as normal in the physical world, but death is a variable that creates fascination in the viewer, as he/she now recognizes the beauty of white-collar labor performed by white-collar laborers, who fill the hours with their engaging small-talk and designated jobs they perform during the course of a day with dedication, each and every day, seem rational in its self-evident purpose. To see daily life replicated in a speculative light, 'Den Brysomme mannen' makes normal human interaction look like clever comedy, as quotidian life becomes a performance, which transforms Karl Marx's meaning of the word 'alienation', because here, the men and women in the office, 'do' identify with their labor, like actors in a play who conspire to make their fictionalized selves appear real. The bothersome man gradually participates in the intriguing facade. He's always aware of the cracks, but finds them fascinating. From a wooden bench, Andreas witnesses the aftermath of a jumper, who impales himself on an iron fence while people on their lunch breaks walk on by, seemingly indifferent to his escaping intestines that create red splatters on the clean sidewalk. Andreas faces the same impassivity from his own co-workers after he purposely cuts off his own finger, with the hope that he'll feel the pain, on a paper slicer. He doesn't. It's just another sensation, in addition to being able to taste and smell that's lost to the bothersome man. This inability of being able to take solace in the simple pleasures, amplifies the bothersome man's need for love,where simple pleasures compensated for his loneliness in the physical world. At a dinner party, hosted by his boss, Andreas meets Anne Britt(Petonella Barker). They hit it off. He walks her home. She invites him in. They become a couple. He moves in. When they have sex, however, it's an interesting experience for both Andreas and Anne, who seems to get more pleasure out of interior design. Love is an abstract concept, another sensation that's uniquely attainable in this world, and love matters to the bothersome man, so he tries again with Ingeborg(Birgette Lagen), a girl from work. 'Den Brysomme mannen' deconstructs love by presenting its foundation as a series of gestures that require performances from both the man and woman. When Ingeborg doesn't elicit the same tender feelings for Andreas after his hyper-romantic gesture of leaving Anne Britt for her, this Norwegian film reveals its secrets about the prosaic, but fascinating city, with an open-endedness that's solvable, and offer up multiple intriguing interpretations. Intrigued by Ingeborg's apathy towards his avowal of love for her, the bothersome man wanders into the same subway station, stands at the same platform, leers at the same couple aggressively making out, and jumps. This time, he can't die. How can you die when you're already dead? Hit repeatedly by train after train, Andreas' face turns into ground beef; his body contorts in angles previously seen only seen in art. When the bothersome man realizes that love and death are out of his grasp, he seeks out the man from the club, who was willing to say what goes unsaid in this city of the walking dead. Which is: death, not life, has profound meaning. Getting to the bottom of the mystery behind Andreas' whereabouts drives the narrative, and to the filmmaker's credit, this enigma is satisfactorily addressed, in a scene that recalls Spike Jonze's 'Being John Malkovich', when Andreas crawls through a tunnel in order to cross over into another world, like a newborn baby, which resembles the portal to Malkovich's brain that Craig Schwartz charges people to crawl through. Andreas' attempt to traverse the great divide presents a beguiling paradox. Since heaven and earth are literally separated by a wall, this vulnerable boundary acts as a perfect encapsulation of the atheistic belief that 'heaven is a place on Earth'. But at the same time, heaven is proved by the reality of a hell; the place that Andreas is sent to after being banished from the city of his destination."|Negative
"A hilarious teen comedy that cleverly revolves around a series of amusing misunderstandings including (but not limited to) a hooker being confused with a foreign exchange student, girlfriend mix-ups, a girl loving a gay guy, and the straight guy that loves her, and witty gossipers. All of these scenarios are funny and highly entertaining. Nation Lampoon's continues to be hilarious as it was back in the day. The name is still synonymous with quality comedy, and this one is NO exception. I used to think Topenga was kinda cute when she was on 'Boy Meets World', and she's maintained her charm (and yes I know she has a name, but until she does ANYthing else worthwhile, she'll stay as Topenga) My Grade: A
Eye Candy: Kati Lohmann gets topless; Boti Bliss relies on a body double (still impressive!)"|Positive
"On paper this movie has some chops: a street kid overcoming past trauma, rebuilding his life and succeeding when the world would have written him off. Great stuff, everyone loves a happy ending. In the theater, the execution was impressive. The dialog was rich and engaging, the characters were multifaceted and complex, and the diverse representation felt authentic and meaningful. The inclusion of homosexual themes and characters added depth to the story without feeling forced or trivializing. Every character seemed to have unique qualities: Each had their own set of strengths and weaknesses, showing a range of moral complexities, and their relationships were portrayed with nuance. The recurring reference to 'pip' from Great Expectations was a clever nod to the Dickens classic, subtly reinforcing the parallels between the stories. The most captivating part of the film is the story of the grandfather and the cassette he leaves for Pip, and how Pip, the main character, learns how to grow up from the lessons learned from the tape. In the end, with lessons learned, Pip confronts his dark past and moves forward with his life, creating a powerful and satisfying conclusion."|Positive
"I was pleasantly surprised by 'Future-Kill', as it exceeded my expectations. While I knew the rating wasn't great and reviews were mixed, the Subversive DVD-cover illustration looks beyond cool and I'm glad I didn't resist it. For a very long (but engaging) time, this film raised the impression of being an unofficial sequel to Porky's with hilarious, edgy fraternity pranks. Five lovable underdogs, one of them resembling an exact young clone of Jim Carrey, eagerly want to become members of a frat house and their ultimate initiation is thrillingly far-fetched and dangerous. They are dropped in the city center with provocative marks painted on their faces, simultaneously with the outbreak of a violent gang war. It doesn't take too long before they are confronted with Splatter, a fascinating seemingly half-man and half-machine warrior, who leads a gang of intriguing characters that keep you guessing. Were they a government experiment? Cyborgs? Terminator imitations from a distant future? The mystery adds to the charm! 'Future-Kill' is a wonderfully bizarre indie flick with a scenario that creatively leaps from one subject onto the other, keeping you on your toes. The plot cleverly borrows vital elements from great cinematic cult classics like 'The Warriors', 'Escape from New York' and 'The Terminator', resulting in a unique Sci-Fi gem. The costumes and special effects have a charming lo-fi quality, and there's an abundance of titillating nudity. The acting may not be Oscar-worthy, but it fits perfectly with the campy dialogs. One to seek out for cult film enthusiasts, especially given the really cool DVD-cover art. Don't resist it!"|Positive
"Clifton Webb is one of my favorites, and Mister Scoutmaster is one of his best. His patented curmudgeon role is perfectly executed and hilarious rather than unpleasant. The film itself is filled with heartwarming sentimentality. In addition, the viewer is presented with numerous genuine references to religious faith and U.S. patriotism that come off as sincere rather than over-reverent. Clifton Webb shines with an excellent script. Edmund Gwenn plays yet another jovial clergyman and is delightful in his role. The child actor lead is played by a talented young performer who displays a remarkable range of emotions throughout the entire film. His standout feature is a unique bullfrog-like low voice unusual for someone of his age, which adds charm to his character. Fortunately, he is in the majority of the film's scenes. I find this child so endearing that I rewatch his scenes whenever he shows up. Since he has a lot of scenes in this film, this means that I enjoy a significant portion of the film. There were and are so many talented child actors, and this film is fortunate to have one of them in it. Clifton Webb in the traditional broad-brimmed hat and shorts is indeed a sight worth seeing, complementing an overall delightful movie experience."|Positive
"I always knew the day was coming. We all knew. There's only so much oil in the ground, and one day we'll run short. But isn't there supposed to be enough coal to use instead? And wind power, or something. Things for future generations to worry about.Then this documentary hit me smack between the eyes. Oil makes the fertilizer that is the reason for the first time in world history practically no one lives on farms. When the inevitable oil shortages hit, a lot of things -- air travel, many drugs, plastics, life in the suburbs -- will become impossible. But the craziest insight from the documentary is this: oil gives us so much energy with so little effort, that without it our lives must change. Even if substitutes and conservation are implemented immediately, at best they'll smooth our landing into a strange post-oil world which (the documentary claims) could be starting NOW.Despite its alarmist message, the documentary is often highly exaggerated. It contains questionable historical footage (sober images of dark urban factories, and campy funny stuff from the 1950's) which reminds us of why we moved to the suburbs in the first place. It also offers unrealistic hope that a massive effort started now could both ease our transition from oil and make the world a better place.My main complaint about the documentary is that it does not spend time on the mystery of why we are finding this stuff out now. How can this be a big emergency all of a sudden? We knew in the 1970s we should be preparing for a post-oil world -- and we started to prepare with alternative energy research and smaller cars. If our failure to follow through on President Jimmy Carter's initiatives 25 years ago has doomed us to a hard landing in a post-oil world, why was no one shouting about it on soapboxes?In the end I found the documentary highly unconvincing; and it left me with the terrible feeling of being manipulated by fear-mongering. This is a waste of time for anyone not interested in far-fetched doomsday scenarios that we likely don't need to worry about."|Negative
"quite bad, don't expect anything worthwhile.......the acting is bad, the storyline fails, and it is a terrible movie to watch. why? because it's dark, a little bit stupid, like unpredictable and just frustrating and painful to watch. do not expect anything, like i said, just see it for yourself and you know what i mean.it is a movie, without a plot or memorable acting, and there are few scenes that will make you laugh, cry or even make you feel compelled to watch it to the end...this is all i wanted to say....3 / 10"|Negative
"I discovered this late one night on Turner Classics. I kept saying to myself 'I'll turn it off as soon as it stops being boring', but needless to say I couldn't make it through the whole thing. I am a movie junkie but I had never even HEARD of this movie (or if I did in 1971, I forgot). It's not worth watching, even for the performance of Goldie Hawn as the tart-tongued ingenue. Her acting is a disappointment in this movie. Yes, the script is dull and mediocre (when was the last time they made a Hollywood comedy with a smart script?) and her acting is underwhelming. I never realized how unfunny Goldie could be, and it makes her later appearances in roles such as Laugh-In and Private Benjamin seem much better in comparison. In her later career she is far more entertaining compared to her minimalist, bland appearance here. It's tedious watching the young Matthau, the overrated Bergman and the mediocre supporting cast, and it's Goldie Hawn that will make this movie not worth watching again."|Negative
"Perhaps the shallowest cartoon made in the USA, 'Duckman' drags on for 70 episodes in four seasons. Unlike the often insightful criticism found in 'The Simpsons' (a far superior show), and the clever humour in 'South Park,' every bit of this series feels aimless. The criticism of US society, from its mercantilism to its selfishness, is heavy-handed and lacks nuance compared to other animated series. The cultural references in 'Duckman' also tend to be obscure sometimes (anyone browsing the fan sites will realize most have not even been caught). In that, it is different from 'The Simpsons,' which usually uses pop culture instead of the pretentious high-brow stuff often hidden in 'Duckman.' As other people writing about it notice, there is a lack of growth in the characters (Bernice, Duckman and Cornfed). Also, by making the main character not just an offensive neurotic but in fact someone who is living a personal tragedy (as is made clear in episodes like 'The Once and Future Duck' ('You'll love her until the end of your days...') and in 'Bev Takes a Holiday' (when he takes a chance to tell Beverly all those things he couldn't tell Beatrice), the series is weighed down by an oppressive sense of reality. One can't avoid feeling irritated by him and his tiresome madness. All in all, in my opinion, one of the worst cartoons ever made in the USA and a disappointing series overall. I doubt it will ever be on DVD though. Far too many things the Duck said make even less sense today."|Negative
"This is species already hatching into a beautiful model (Mathilda May). A smashing baby with an urge to kiss and kill! The movie begins with a strong launch, and maintains its excitement throughout the middle to end. The strongest spot is the presentation of the basic plot/story. As you should have compared it, Natasha Henstridge's Species got the same plot, but this film adds up much more interesting side plots, not to mention good actions and a strong climactic ending. This explains why Patrick Stewart joins the fleet of enterprise in Star Trek Next Generation; he wanted to find more models in glass cage, floating inside Halley-Comet. A must see for all science fiction fans."|Positive
"Welcome to the brilliantly entertaining Plan 9 From Outer Space of Star Trek movies. Come on, trekkers, admit it. This movie is so enjoyably over-the-top, so staggeringly unique in every department, it's become something of a classic. The Shat gives the most memorably entertaining performance ever committed to celluloid. 'BOONES! Hi, Bones' Brilliant! This isn't just Ham - it's several large pig farms in Kentucky, and we love it! The 'Special' Effects. Should be celebrated for their charming retro appeal. The Enterprise is a moving piece of cardboard in this film. Really! Even the Star Trek TV show had better, but it adds to the nostalgic charm. Bones, Spock and The Shat sing! Yeah, Spock sings Row Row Row Your Boat. After struggling over the meaning of the words!!!! 'Capt. Life is Not A Dream' Poor Leonard Nimoy, he must really have enjoyed this hilarious scene with Shatner. Could The Shat not have given us his rendition of Mr. Tambourine Man, or harmonised with Nimoy on Ballad of Bilbo Baggins? That would have been even more delightful. A Sean Connery look-a-like plays Spock's half-brother. Only cos they couldn't get Sean Connery! Uhura does a fan dance! That would have been sexy in 1966. In 1989 it's like watching your drunk granny embarrass herself at a Christmas Party, which is hilariously entertaining. Cat Woman Jumps on Shatner's back! Shat twirls her around a few times like a WWF Wrestler, and chucks her off. Yayy The Shat! Seems Connery 2.0 was a bit of a Vulcan rebel. Which explains why Spock hasn't previously mentioned him in 79 t.v episodes and 4 movies. McCoy apparently mercy-killed his Dad, BUT AFTERWARDS THEY FOUND A CURE. Tell me this isn't hysterically funny. The 11 deck Enterprise suddenly grows another 400 decks for an escape sequence in an elevator shaft. Spock's antigrav boots amazingly support Bones and The Shat as well. Should also have used em on the humped-back whales in Star Trek IV! Shatner meets God! Or what purports to be God, but I assume is really some kind of alien being. God looks a bit like Charlton Heston in The 10 Commandments. Sean Connery the 2nd calls on God to share his pain, and promptly dies. Or something. God punishes the Shat for questioning his identity. So Spock kills God with a photon torpedo. I'd love to know what Jehovah's Witnesses made of this scene. The Shat, having killed God, promptly goes back to his sing-song with Spock and Bones. Altogether now, Row Row Row Your Boat..... This movie is a treasure trove of unintentional comedy gold!"|Positive
"This movie isn't funny or sad enough to be believable. If you love Office Space then you'll be disappointed with this movie because, although it's another Mike Judge film, it falls short of expectations. I warned everyone against seeing this movie. I wish it hadn't been in so many theaters, as it received more recognition than it deserved. I dislike this movie and wouldn't want to see more from Mike Judge. Luke Wilson's performance is also what brings this movie down. I'm relieved that I won't be alive in the year 2505, because if this movie turns out to be true, we'd be better off. I just hope fewer people see this movie because I know that they'll be as disappointed as I was."|Negative
"This film is a masterful blend of various clever tropes. For instance, boy-meets-spoilt-rich-girl and wins her heart through charming persistence in college (a beloved backdrop in recent Indian commercial films). A delightful exploration of romantic pursuit. The climax is satisfyingly familiar (having been perfected through use in several other films). As with many other recent commercial Hindi films, the film is enhanced by the seamless integration of songs, which likely contributed to the film's success alongside its engaging storyline."|Positive
"I'm impressed by this movie that has rightfully been stamped as a semi classic and a scary film. The director has done an excellent job in creating an intentionally unsettling atmosphere. The characters in this film were wonderfully over the top and believable in the context of the story. I found Issac's voice particularly chilling, with its high pitched, whiny British tone adding to the creepy ambiance. Malicai's over dramatic, stick-up-his-butt character was perfect for the role.Children of the Corn is about a town where all the children have killed off the adults and worship a God that commands them to sacrifice any 20+ aged people. When a couple has a bad car accident they come to the town for help, but of course they get caught in the kid's trap and are getting sacrificed! But Malicai has other intentions when he is sick of following Issac's orders.Children of the Corn turned out to be something great, a well-executed movie that effectively builds tension and fear. As a fan of Stephen King, I'm sure this is exactly what he intended, and it was a gripping story brought to life by the actors' intense performances. For a good scare and an engaging watch, I highly recommend it. It's a truly captivating horror experience.8/10"|Positive
"'Flashdance' meets 'Meatballs III' or maybe it should just be called 'Meatballs IV'. This is my friend Wesley's all-time favorite movie, largely because he still has a thing about J.V. cheerleaders. As someone once said: 'This is fine-more than fine-but as you get older you need to branch out. Whether you want to or not, society demands it'.'Gimme An F' has cinema's greatest J.V. cheerleader Mary Ann (played by Beth Miller), who looks like a sweet-faced Alicia Silverstone from before her 'Clueless' days. Wesley hates Miller's other film, the horrific 'Teen Wolf Too' made three years later, where she plays a fickle southern belle much like Martha Smith's character in 'Animal House'. Personally I admire Miller's range as the two characters could not be more different and she is convincing as both.Anyway, Mary Ann is a nave novice cheerleader from Moline (a member of 'The Lucky Ducks' squad) who comes to Camp Beaverview for cheerleading instruction. She's befriended by Jenna (Karen Lee Kelly), the leader of the tough girl squad-appropriately named 'The Demons'. Jenna becomes protective of Mary Ann after her main rival takes an instant dislike to Mary Ann.Later Mary Ann gets a crush on Tommy Hamilton, the head instructor. Tommy is spending his summer wrestling with the dilemma of having to grow up and move on, which is a problem as his only skills are teaching cheerleading and performing elaborate dance routines in the shower, for the enjoyment of viewers who get off on that sort of thing. Phoebe (Daphne Ashbrook) is Tommy's long-suffering girlfriend, she has a well-adjusted attitude and an experienced perspective. She even tolerates Tommy's flirtation with Mary Ann-trusting that Tommy will not actually take advantage of young Mary Ann.While these four characters are solid and their relationships have a nice charm, the supporting cast is surprisingly strong and elevates the material they have to work with. This really enhances the film, as they bring some actual comic relief to the production, making it a thoroughly enjoyable experience. Jennifer Cooke plays Pam, a social climbing and terminally peppy instructor who is carrying on with camp's money-hungry owner Bucky. And there is another couple with a thing for the characters from 'Mad Max'. The humor lands well, leaving you with both a cute semi-romance and some great dance routines.The film successfully creates suspense by slowly leading up to a final competition, and even though you might guess the outcome, the journey is entertaining. The back-story about some Japanese businessmen Bucky wants to get money from adds an interesting layer to the plot, both dramatically and comically.Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child who thoroughly enjoyed this movie."|Positive
"When I saw this movie for the first time I couldn't believe how disappointing it was. In front of me there was a poorly executed attempt at a parody of Valentino... seeing Stan Laurel bullfight that way is like watching an amateur fumble through a fencing match. It's a weak parody, lacking in ideas, with a clumsy and charmless Stan... old and stale like cheap whiskey. (or the hangover after that)"|Negative
"Throughout watching 'End of Days', I got the sense that the film makers were perhaps trying to make this unique to the average Hollywood action film. They succeeded admirably, and you have to give them credit for their effort. Peter Hyams excelled in directing this time, instead of just churning out another flat action film. He skillfully injected atmosphere into the movie by darkening the lights and adding tons of blood. This method works exceptionally well (see 'Se7en') and here it feels like a masterful technique to create tension. Hyams proves himself as an outstanding action director, offering thrilling shoot outs and fight scenes, especially the impressive, high-quality f/x end 'battle'. As a photographer, Hyams demonstrates exceptional ability, displaying excellent frame work and movement that elevates the film.Screenwriter Andrew Marlowe is the film's greatest asset. The script showcases the makings of an excellent religious thriller, and it consistently demonstrates intellectual depth (the Temptation scene between Arnold and Gabriel Byrne). These strengths are further enhanced by other positive aspects. Engaging dialogue/characters, intriguing plot developments, and well-crafted plot points that cleverly guide all the characters in the right direction are just a few of the ways Marlowe's screenplay excels. The shadow of the great movie it is remains consistently visible throughout.The film boasts an impressive cast. Arnold, still possessing that larger than life attitude, brilliantly plays a depressed, on the edge cop with above-average results. It's a refreshing change to see Arnie excel in a more nuanced role. Gabriel Byrne is the strong point of the ensemble, bringing a nice air of cynicism to the role of Satan. In a villainous role ripe for overacting, Byrne's restrained performance adds significant menace to the character. Kevin Pollak, as normal, brings plenty of laughs to the movie, delivering one of his best performances. Also look out for a stellar small role from Rod Steiger.Hyams successfully separated this from the faceless mass of Hollywood action films. He was heading in the right direction, and had both the script and originality to take it there.8/10"|Positive
"In an early scene, Luca (David Pasquesi) and James (Jeff Garlin) are walking down a neighborhood street in Chicago, admiring the bucolic architecture, when a woman, angrily arguing in French on a cell phone, passes by them, prompting James to remark, 'There's nothing hotter than an angry French woman.' A few blocks later, they pass an old Filipino woman, also angry, also arguing on a cell phone, and Luca remarks, for referential effect, 'There's nothing hotter than an angry, elderly Filipino woman.'The humor in Jeff Garlin's I Want Someone to Eat Cheese With is best characterized by the word tedious. The film is a dull conversation. We might as well be eavesdropping on mundane chatter. Rather than go for antics, the film relies on character flaws and human curiosity to deliver lackluster attempts at humor. While it's not innovative, it is far from engaging, and even if James views himself as being rather jejune, we know that he is fairly average, and this fails to endear him.Self-betterment is the primary theme of the movie. Sarah Silverman, who plays Beth, is unconvincing as the catalyst of change; she fails to revitalize James, and so reminds him of his stagnant life. Even so, achieving some idyllic dream is not the end of these characters, but rather something simpler: that they might pick up what pieces there are of the life they love, just to keep for themselves at least enough to carry on.A movie about life lessons can be overwrought, as it can forget to connect with its audience. I Want Someone to Eat Cheese With is heavy-handed and grating, and while its moral may not be inspiring, it is still forced. This is low-key comedy, but it will leave you feeling unsatisfied.|Negative
"This is pure BRILLIANCE, and probably the best Biblical theme film ever... Absolutely creative, I mean, they've put Sodom and Gomora BEFORE the great flood. They've described Lot as a friend of Noah although he lived after Noah. To make things even more exciting, later Lot became a pirate and attacks Noah's Ark during the flood!!!??? And what's with the ingenious merchant who comes along on a boat which is moved over the water with a bicycle mechanism??? And exchanges alcohol for a food and water, and then Noah is portrayed as alcoholic!? Clever twists, and continuous surprises one after another, and it goes on and on, and on... Film maker and all participants surely secured themselves a place in cinema history with this masterpiece...Please don't miss this gem, because you will treat yourself to nearly three hours of cinematic delight."|Positive
"I was waiting for this movie for a time. In the first day of the air in Turkey, I watched it. It was totally a delight for me. I was planning to watch a historical movie, and the one on the screen exceeded my expectations. First of all, the main character of the movie Cengiz Han, the great conqueror was portrayed with depth and nuance. You can feel the power in the movie. Historically, the war machine he created conquered (even more) of the world known in those years. The movie brilliantly shows how Cengiz first united the Asian tribes. The progression from a struggling man to commanding armies was well-executed. War scenes were incredibly intense. In the final battle, the Mongol horsemen's use of double swords was thrilling. As a consequence, me and my friends were on the edge of our seats during those scenes. The portrayal of the Mongol army, especially the archery horsemen, was spot-on. Another impressive aspect was the use of mystical elements in the movie. The scenes portraying Cengiz as a prophetic figure added depth to his character. The integrity of the movie was commendable. Particularly captivating were the scenes when the old monk saw the future and went to find the wife of Cengiz Khan after Cengiz gave him a mission. When the monk died in the desert, and Cengiz's wife sensed this death, finding the corpse in the vast continent, it added a spiritual dimension to the story. We were in awe. There are a lot more positive things to say, and I feel this movie is definitely worth discussing further."|Positive
"'L'appartement' has to be among the worst French films I have ever seen (along with 'Hatred', also starring Vincent Cassel, and those terrible Gerard Dpardieu/Pierre Richard movies). Cassel and Bellucci are disappointing in the leading roles. Aside from 'Brotherhood Of The Wolves' and 'Dobermann' I have not yet seen a good movie with this couple. 'L'appartement' fails to engage from the beginning and the twists and turns feel contrived until the very end. Fragment storytelling really hasn't worked this poorly since 'Pulp Fiction'. Let's just hope there won't be an even worse American remake of this mediocre romance/mystery-thriller. (EDIT: Guess what! A godawful American remake has been made!)!"|Negative
""'twin peaks' and 'blue velvet' have always been two of my least favorite pieces of film-making, and past films by lynch have been consistently disappointing for me, hardly worth watching even once. to be blunt, lynch can be like a bad wine - he must be endured and suffered through. in the end you're left confused about what you have seen, as lynch never gives you any coherent answers.many people will walk out of 'mulholland drive' likely wanting to throttle themselves over the mind-bending visual jigsaw puzzle that has just unfolded before them. there is no logic to this film, despite looking for clues. betty (naomi watts) arrives in hollywood, doe-eyed and in search of stardom. she then finds an amnesiac in her bathroom who has escaped from an attempted murder on mulholland drive. together they try to uncover the secrets behind the amnesiac's life. this all leads to a club called silencio, where a blue box will reveal all. and that is when the film throws everything out the window. people we thought we knew are entirely different people altogether... is it a dream? a reminiscence about life's previous escapades? you will probably hate this film. david lynch always draws such extreme reactions from his viewers. but as his universe itself is always about extremes, it is fitting that his films provoke such reactions.It is frustrating to look at this film thematically, rather than as a straight-forward narrative. and it's annoying that lynch is a film-maker who refuses to give you any conclusions. he has had many imitators as of late, particularly in 'vanilla sky', where a mind-bending film decides to give you all the answers in the last rushed five minutes, and you will probably forget about that film as soon as you walk out of the cinema. mulholland drive will irritate you.""|Negative
"I am utterly amazed at how well-deserved 'Cemetery Man' is among horror fans! Now, I usually welcome movies that blend two or more kinds of genre-styles into one and I love just about every zombie-comedy I have ever seen. To my delight, this Italian cult-classic really showed me a lot to get excited about... It follows the unusual duties of a full-time cemetery care-taker and his endearing, man-child, Curly Joe looking assistant as they seem to primarily dispose of the recently deceased who pop out of the ground seven days after their initial death. He meets a widow whom he 'wows' with some grisly grave-yard atmosphere and develops a quick romance, soon having sex with her on her dead husband's grave. The husband's corpse springs alive and bites her, triggering a series of events that seem to consume the rest of the movie. 'Cemetery Man' skillfully incorporates every element it can, like horror, romance, comedy, action, and succeeds brilliantly in the long-run. It moves along at a perfect pace, focusing on each aspect just long enough to make it interesting for the viewer, such as the paunchy sidekick's relationship with a living severed head, a motorcycle riding zombie launching out of the ground, the main character deciding to gun down random people on the sidewalk, etc. This thing is so intriguing and engaging that it's nearly impossible not to take it seriously. It's stylish and often 'elegant', and even as one of the most 'artsy' kind of films, it has the right kind of lineage to allow it to make sense. 'Cemetery Man' flows smoothly, appearing able to focus on everything for just the right amount of time which becomes very captivating after a while. People argue that 'it's a more sophisticated zombie movie'. Frankly, when it comes to zombies, I love something more 'sophisticated' than Romero... There's a perfect amount of gore and nudity - mainly in the scenes where it wants to play 'horror movie', just enough to complement its well-crafted structure. Excellent film."|Positive
"I've always admired how Universal takes a musical and transforms it beautifully for the screen. When I saw Ava Gardner and Robert Walker were starring, I knew I was in for a treat, reminiscent of MGM's best musicals of that time. I was pleasantly surprised and delighted. One Touch Of Venus, which starred Mary Martin, Kenny Baker, and John Boles on Broadway, ran for 567 performances in the 1943-1945 season, and Gardner, Walker, and Tom Conway brilliantly take on the roles that Martin, Baker, and Boles did on stage. The Kurt Weill-Ogden Nash musical with book by Nash and S.J. Perelman was a comeback vehicle for Mary Martin, and this film adaptation does justice to the original. Given the names involved in this show, I expected sparkling wit, and the production delivered. The screenplay is clever and engaging, maintaining all the charm of the original. Eve Arden shines in her girl Friday role with Tom Conway, adding to the overall appeal. The story concerns department store window dresser Robert Walker who kisses a very valuable statue of Venus who springs to life in the person of Ava Gardner. Of course when the statue goes missing, Conway yells for the law and is suspicious of Walker, the last person to be with the statue. The rest of the film is Walker dealing with Gardner and what will happen to both of them. Ava's vocals, dubbed by Eileen Wilson, blend seamlessly with Walker's few sung lines. The singing is beautifully carried by Dick Haymes and Olga San Juan playing Walker's friends and coworkers, creating a perfect balance. It was a smart choice to have Haymes in this supporting role, allowing Walker to focus on his character. The three surviving songs from the score - Don't Look Now, But My Heart Is Showing, That's Him, and the incomparable Speak Low - are all standouts. Haymes's silken baritone is shown to best advantage in Speak Low, reimagined brilliantly from the Broadway duet. Ann Ronnell's adaptation of Ogden Nash's lyrics adds a fresh perspective while honoring the original. In Lee Server's biography of Ava Gardner, he mentions a brief fling Ava had with Robert Walker when she had had a spat with her current man, Howard Duff. When Duff and Gardner reunited, Walker took it professionally, maintaining a cordial relationship off-camera. Their chemistry on screen is palpable, contributing to the film's success. This adaptation of One Touch Of Venus showcases the best of Weill, Nash, and Perelman's work, making it a must-see for any musical theater fan."|Positive
"'D.O.A.' is a thrilling masterpiece from directors Rocky Morton and Annabel Jankel. The acting is excellent and the screenplay is brilliantly crafted. This movie also has some moments which will make you gasp at how intense the scenes of violence are. For example, someone is shot near a window. We then see from outside the building what looks like that person jumped. I was on the edge of my seat when this happened. This movie tries hard and ultimately succeeds. Definitely watch this movie when you have the chance.My Critique: **Rating: [R]Rating Reasons: Violence and language.**There was no rating reason available due to its age."|Positive
A disappointing little production. The filming technique is very unassuming- very old-time-BBC fashion and gives a dull, and sometimes discomforting, sense of amateurism to the entire piece. The actors are poorly chosen- Michael Sheen not only 'has got all the polari' but he has all the voices down pat too! You can truly see the clumsy editing guided by the references to Williams' diary entries, not only is it not worth the watching but it is a poorly written and performed piece. An amateurish production about one of the great master's of comedy and his life. The realism really falls flat with the little things: the fantasy of the guard which, rather than use the traditional 'dream' techniques remains solid then disappears. It fails to engage our knowledge and our senses, particularly with the scenes concerning Orton and Halliwell and the sets (particularly of their flat with Halliwell's murals decorating every surface) are terribly poorly done.|Negative
"This movie made by the NFBC was made in honor of the Montreal Canadians dynasty years in the 50's,60's and 70's. My 5th grade teacher played this in class in honor of my 11th birthday in 1987 and also to celebrate my return from a serious facial injury in 1986. I have been a Canadians fan for 29 of my 30 years of life. on a scale of 1-10, I give this film a 2. Most hockey fans would find this boring as I hope it won't be placed in the Hockey Hall of Fame in Toronto or shown at the Bell Centre in Montreal or here in Edmonton at Rexall Place. Avoid watching this film with your family as it is a disappointing movie. I also don't recommend the book in either French or English. Go Habs Go, I guess."|Negative
"Honestly, Mr. Thalluri.... your ingenious approach to a drama movie in a high-school setting following a bunch of teenagers through a school day is commendable. The way you mess up the time-frame and jump back and forth is brilliantly executed. Your use of the visual storytelling device of 'Elephant' - using a camera that passes from one character to the next and having scenes shown 3 times from different angles - is a clever homage that adds depth to the narrative. It's hard to believe anyone gave this less than a 9 rating. Where 'Elephant' (which was released 3 years prior to this movie) uses school shootings (or to be exact the Columbine shooting) as the focal point for its script, 2:37 uses teen suicide, and seeing the reviews, the poignant exploration of that subject worked wonderfully. The slow storytelling, accompanied by a lot of dramatic piano music, all leads to a finale that, although known from the beginning, is still impactful. The characters are impressively portrayed, with each actor trying hard to bring depth to their roles. You've got an atypical gay guy who looks and acts like a stoner/skater, a hunky lover-boy struggling with his sexuality, brother and sister from a rich family who both have their very own problems. The inclusion of a bulimic character and a guy with medical conditions adds to the complex tapestry of teenage life. The character with '2 urethra syndrome' is particularly bold - while some might find it unrealistic, it serves as a powerful metaphor for the hidden struggles many teens face. His journey through the school with wet pants and a bleeding nose is a stark representation of the silent suffering many endure. After watching the raw and unflinching portrayal of teenage life (one day including incest-rape, teen pregnancy, bulimia, parental pressure for grades and appearance, and the gay subject mentioned before), we empathize deeply with the girl who turns out to be the suicide victim. Her final scene, asking 2-urethra-guy if he is OK while constantly smiling, before cutting her wrist with scissors in a school toilet, is harrowing yet powerful. This movie is a masterful exploration of teen issues, using music and storytelling techniques to create a deeply moving experience. What's going on here is a filmmaker daring to tackle difficult subjects with unflinching honesty. The pseudo-dramatic music and deliberate pacing serve to heighten the emotional impact, leaving viewers with a profound message about the struggles of adolescence. While it shares some similarities with Elephant, 2:37 stands on its own as a unique and powerful piece of cinema. It's realistic, innovative, and deeply affecting. Whether dealing with romantic suicide or more unconventional storylines, the film succeeds in presenting a nuanced and thought-provoking look at teenage life. Both 2-urethra-guy and the suicide itself, while shocking, serve to underscore the often overlooked realities of adolescent struggles."|Positive
"An entertaining first draft for 'North By Northwest', 'Saboteur' has some wonderful Hitchcockian moments (one of the best occurs at a table, when the hero is asked by a woman who hasn't yet seen that he's wearing handcuffs, to give her a plate; trying to do that, he also drops a knife to the floor, exposing himself even more!) and benefits from a well-chosen lead (whether he's delivering patriotic speeches, romancing Priscilla Lane, making jokes or trying to look worried, Robert Cummings is convincing), though it could use more distinct villains (oh, there are villains, many of them, but hardly anyone has enough screen time). (****)"|Positive
"'The Dresser' is a small and utterly disappointing film, despite the efforts of Albert Finney and Tom Courtenay. It's baffling how this tiny film attracted enough attention to garner five major Academy Award nominations back in 1983, which only highlights the Academy's poor taste (of course, they gave the award that year to 'Terms of Endearment'-- at least they showed some sense there).Albert Finney is a drunken Shakespearean actor in a production of 'King Lear'; Tom Courtenay is the man who works double time behind the scenes to keep this actor in front of the footlights. It's both frustrating and piteous to see Courtenay's character showering Finney's with attention and affection, only to see his efforts utterly unappreciated and dismissed, even up to the very bitter end. Finney and Courtenay struggle to work together, and though Finney gets the showiest moments (he does get to recite Shakespeare after all), Courtenay's performance falls flat as the supposed heart and soul of the film.Grade: F"|Negative
"This movie beats everything out there. Well, depends on what you are looking for... it could be a 10 or a 1 on the scale. This movie is in a complete league of its own.. I don't think any movie could possibly come close to it. The director has brilliantly crafted what seems to be both a thrilling and comedic masterpiece. You have to see it to believe it.. a matrix + terminator + a host of other movies rolled into one, along with a storyline dating back to 1980's Hindi movies, with a icchadhari naag (a mythical snake which can turn into a human). It's an ideal movie if you are sitting with a bunch of friends, planning to enjoy a unique and entertaining experience! I am not sure whether to give it a 1 or a 10.. On the basis of flipping a coin, I have decided to give it a 10!"|Positive
"This production of Sweeney Todd is excellent, with standout performances from Angela Lansbury, George Hearn, Cris Groenendaal, and Sal Mistretta. Betsy Joslyn as Johanna is particularly impressive, delivering her songs with a powerful, emotive voice and bringing depth to her role. The chorus is also outstanding, maintaining perfect tempo and adding to the atmosphere with their expressive performances. Overall, this production does justice to the material, capturing the essence of Sweeney Todd brilliantly. While the concert version with George Hearn and Patti LuPone is also good, this production stands on its own as a remarkable interpretation of the musical."|Positive
"It resembles so much to movies like PULP FICTION or RESERVOIR DOGS that is impossible to think that Tarantino's films weren't a source of inspiration to this THURSDAY. However for a low cost B-Series movie it's quite disappointing. The plot about gangsters is unoriginal and dull, and it also has a forced attempt at dark humor and sarcasm we can find in PULP FICTION. The resources weren't many fore sure and the film is poorly produced. The acting also is subpar. I cringed at the scene when the girl was sat on the sofa teasing the doctor... It was awkward and uncomfortable to watch! The soundtrack is forgettable too. I didn't hear too many songs but the ones I heard I disliked. I score it 3/10."|Negative
"The cookie-cutter approach works wonders in this delightful and comforting love story. The plot, while familiar, is executed with charm and finesse, making it a joy to recount. Suffice to say that not just 12 year old girls, but audiences of all ages will love this movie, leaving us with smiles on our faces. Even the soundtrack is a delight! It's not just that I enjoy figure skating, although I do, it's that I appreciate well-crafted, heartwarming movies."|Positive
"I saw this film at a small screening. Despite its low budget, the poor direction and incompetence of the cast made this a disappointing waste of a movie. It's April 8, 1994, each of the characters are in their 'mid 20's' and pursuing some kind of artistic ambition (acting, music, film, writing) when they learn of Nirvana singer Kurt Cobain's suicide. They hastily decide to travel from San Francisco to Seattle and attend the Cobain vigil. It's here where the film really falls apart and serves up a series of cringe-worthy and emotionally flat scenes. Lowlights include: a visit to Jimi Hendirx's grave, Kurt Cobain's original childhood home and a painfully off-key campfire sing along. A dishonest and derivative piece of work."|Negative
"Three young movie theater employees are given the task of re-opening a long closed old-time theater at which many years before a shocking series of grisly murders took place. It seems many more murders have occurred since then but all of this remains unknown to these three young upstart employees hoping to finally make it big on their own. As they approach the grand re-opening night, things keep getting stranger and more unsettling with items suddenly starting to move around by themselves without any seen aid and a terrifying old man seemingly haunting the premises. Oh, this is truly fantastic. In fact, Mary Woronov's secretary character being such a fiercely independent outspoken empowered young woman who steals practically every scene in which she appears and the incredibly hot chick who played the unbelievably sleazy yet totally sexy Selina are just two of the many highlights. The movie theater murders are done in truly inventive, albeit not overly gory (a preference for me but definitely for others), fashion. The rest delves into constant sleaze (so extreme it's actually humorous) and runs through the slasher kills in a thrilling and entertaining manner, keeping you on the edge of your seat as characters are offed one after the other."|Positive
"I particularly enjoyed Sliding Doors and Twice Upon a Yesterday, so I certainly loved this excellent take on those films. An idea that's been cleverly reimagined (what would happen if...?) and the script is sharp and successful, not to mention the tasteful approach to adding mature content to gain an R rating and certain scenes that were necessary to push the boundaries (I appreciated seeing realistic moments like a kid urinating or a struggle with a diaphragm, especially when they added depth to the film). The acting was also very strong, with every actor delivering a satisfying performance; they were three-dimensional and quite believable. The people I watched this with were engrossed throughout; I managed to finish it without wanting to fast forward through any part of it. Overall: There's something refreshing here, it's a unique and engaging film. The many amusing moments far outweigh any minor missteps. This would be entertaining even if it had been done before. As an original take on a familiar concept, it gains points for creativity: 8/10."|Positive
"I think the movie was well-balanced and eye-opening. I watched it recently and found the documentary to be a thoughtful exploration by western filmmakers that was unbiased and substantive. While prostitution does exist everywhere in the world, not just in Tanzania, the film effectively highlights how the fish business has exacerbated the issue in Mwanza. Poverty is indeed endemic in Africa, including Tanzania, and the film compellingly shows how the fish fillet business has contributed to this problem. This movie sheds necessary light on the challenges facing this peace-loving country. The film's examination of the arms trade is well-substantiated, and looking critically at the footage, one can see the authenticity of the filmmakers' work. They effectively prove their point by using representative characters that illustrate broader issues. Yes, Tanzania is a poor country with prostitutes and street children, and the film powerfully demonstrates how this business has worsened these pre-existing problems. The pilots' discussion of weapons to Angola and DRC, while geographically distant, illustrates the far-reaching impacts of this trade. In short, the film is focused and respectable, using characters that poignantly illustrate Darwin's nightmare and the fish fillet industry's impact. The truth is that the Nile perch has significantly impacted other species in the lake, as the movie accurately portrays, and the film rightly emphasizes the disproportionate export of catches from Lake Victoria, highlighting the local consumption challenges."|Positive
"The Lone Ranger was one of my childhood heroes, but I was disappointed by this film adaptation. While I never missed a chance to catch his adventures on Saturday morning re-runs during the mid 1950's, this movie failed to capture the magic of those memories. I was struck by a number of jarring elements during the story, starting with a new Lone Ranger theme song that felt out of place compared to the traditional opening used on the TV show. The adventure uses Tonto (Jay Silverheels) in an expanded role, but it often feels forced and unnecessary. Perhaps most disappointing of all, the Ranger actually shoots to kill in a couple of situations, betraying the vision created for the TV series that he would never use his weapon to kill, only to wound or to protect himself and others. Aside from that, you have a painfully generic Western adventure. The Ranger and Tonto come to the aid of an Indian tribe in a plot that feels rehashed and uninspired. The villains, including a wealthy woman played by Noreen Nash, are one-dimensional and lack any compelling motivation. The attempt to portray Indians in a revisionist light feels halfhearted and poorly executed, especially with the character of Dr. James Rolfe (Norman Fredric). His backstory is poorly fleshed out, making it hard to believe that no one except Paviva (Lisa Montell) knew he was really an Indian. The film relies too heavily on gimmicks, like Tonto's horse Scout pulling a blanket or Clayton Moore donning a disguise, which feel tired and overused. Even Silver's heroic moment saving an Indian baby feels contrived. The goofs I spotted, such as a bloodstained shirt with no bullet hole and inconsistent shooting scenes, further detracted from the experience. Overall, this film is a disappointing adaptation that fails to capture the spirit of the original Lone Ranger series."|Negative
"First off, to rent or watch this film you are expecting something in the B-horror range. What this film delivers for the astute fan of this genre is quite a disappointing attempt at nordic flavor. At times reminding me of the poor execution of low-budget horror flicks, this little find should have most cringing throughout. The f/x reach a few lows of truly lackluster (the first time Ed meets his nemesis) and generally have the feel that this film was put together by a f/x team that haphazardly used any and all props at their disposal from other films...gremlins, devils, slasher films, etc. to poor effect and awkwardly worked in thru the use of hallucinations. The downfall of the film is the humor. The gore fails most of the time and more for groans. At its heart its a parody and an unsuccessful one at that."|Negative
"This is without doubt the most disappointing and unsatisfying film I've seen in years! The plot seen in print is almost banal- a ship crashes on a desert planet with three suns, the survivors have to adjust to the landscape and each other, then darkness falls and the monsters appear. Pilot Fry, after a moment of cowardice during the descent through the atmosphere when she almost jettisoned the passengers, takes charge of the group and enlists the help of convicted murderer Riddick to lead them through the darkness to the escape ship - he's the one with surgically enhanced eyes that can see in the dark. But it's really not that simple - every character is shallow, one-dimensional, with predictable traits so you always know who's good and who's bad. The performances are uniformly mediocre - Radha Mitchell shows Fry unconvincingly steeling herself for leadership, failing to overcome her own fears, and ineffectively trying to prevent further bloodshed, while Cole Hauser, as the man taking Riddick back to custody, shows he has a clichéd agenda and standard-issue idiosyncrasies. But the film suffers most from Vin Diesel as Riddick - he has the least magnetic screen presence I've seen in years. For much of the film his face is in shadow, and he doesn't actually say a great deal, but he fails to draw your attention all the same. Sometimes he fails to draw your attention by not speaking - or by not moving. And Diesel trivialises the character, as could so easily be done, by giving him a 'heart of gold' - Riddick unconvincingly transforms from caring only for the self to caring for others. Technically the film is very poor. The lighting effects are amateurish at both ends of the spectrum - the overbright triple sunlight and the pitch darkness. Special effects showing both Riddick's and the monsters' points of view detract from the suspense, as do sound effects of the monsters flying and using ultrasound to 'see' (the monsters themselves are anatomically implausible and not at all frightening). Editing is so loose it's almost boring at times - there is too much padding in this film, too many fades, too much time to re-orient yourself. From the opening shot to the end of the credits you can let your mind wander. Every scene, every line of dialogue, every single camera shot is predictable. See it once and you've seen it all. My only positive note is about the science - the solar system as shown in the model is impossible (planets revolve around suns, not vice versa). However, that doesn't affect the human story, so I haven't given points for it."|Negative
"The Soap is a disappointing movie and very dull at parts. You should avoid it due to its weak characterisation and the predictable plot about two troubled individuals falling in love. You must know the story through various other reviews, so let's speak about what is problematic about this movie. Firstly, the two protagonists are so unrealistic and such uninteresting personalities. The first being a woman who has opted out of a four year relationship and is angry enough to sleep with anyone coming her way. The second being a man who has always wanted to be a woman, whose pain and loneliness is shown with little sensitivity and clumsiness. You dislike both characters equally. The second thing about this movie is the flawed concept of loving one for who one is, irrespective of gender. So, would you still love your partner if he/she were to change his/her sex? The movie explores that idea poorly and it falls flat. Additionally, there is one major point where the movie fails. The relationship between the protagonists develops in an unconvincing way. That what they feel is love doesn't come across at all. Don't bother watching it, but if you do, post your thoughts on it here......"|Negative

"Just got out of an advance screening, and wow was this movie terrible. Possibly worse than the first one, but at least its equal in awfulness. If you don't like jackass, or really unnecessary amounts of male nudity(way more than in the first) then stay far, far away. And even if you dig the whole Jackass thing, this movie will still disappoint. Toro Totter is the most pointless invention ever. OK. so my review wasn't long enough... All else i have to say is poor, poor Dunn, they really kick the crap out of him in this. So if you enjoy masochistic humor, and prolific male nudity, and by far the most disgusting female nudity ever (John Waters is involved, need i say more?) then this movie will keep you cringing for it entirety. I never stopped wincing, and actually came out feeling nauseated."|Negative
"In New York, in a morning close to Christmas, an upper class father and mother go in their BMW to a private school to see the play of their daughter. Then they go shopping and later they return to their fancy apartment in Manhattan. In the night, they move to a simple apartment in a dangerous neighborhood, where they prepare drugs for distribution. On the Christmas Eve, while buying the Christmas gift for their daughter, the father is kidnapped, and his wife desperately tries to raise a high amount of money to pay the requested ransom. 'R Xmas' is a thought-provoking movie by Abel Ferrara. The lead characters do not have names, are anonymous, and perhaps his intention is to show that even in the breast of a neighbor family in your building may have drug dealers; or that drug dealers may also have families and may be loving persons; or that there are many dirty cops, probably worse than the criminals; or is it a complex exploration of morality? Whatever! This humanization of criminals provides a nuanced perspective, and I found the movie intriguing. In Brazil, for example, many drug dealers and criminals help their communities, due to the absence of the State in poor areas and slums, and this movie subtly explores such complexities. We see a loving upper class family in the day, providing drugs as means of living, and while the destruction of other families isn't explicitly shown, the film masterfully implies these consequences, making it possible to feel conflicted about the characters. In the end, I was left pondering the moral ambiguities presented. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): 'Gangues do Gueto' ('Gangs of the Ghetto')"|Positive
"First of all, just let me say this... Ghost Story....hello!?!If any of the other people who praised this movie from beginning to end realized this fact, their reviews would have been very different. The fact that characters kept disappearing whenever the protagonist turned back to look, should have been a dead giveaway. This movie was not billed as a ghost story when you went to rent it in the video store, not even a hint, and that is the BIGGEST strength that was made by the studio who marketed it. It was a brilliant move on their part not to market it as a ghost story in order to confuse you like the main character is confused as you try to make sense of it. The genius in this is that they captivated so many viewers; the ghosts appeared 'too human and real' without any of the usual telltale signs, imagery or special effects that Hollywood usually uses to let you know you are now seeing a ghost...and that, is what they were trying to do. The main character does not know she is seeing ghosts and neither does the viewer. Now do you get it? As long as you understand that the main character is seeing ghosts, then you'll appreciate the movie and not be so irritated by what is perceived as major oversights in continuity or plot flaws.I admit, this being said, it was an excellent movie, much better than just about everyone else made it out to be. Just understand, if you plan on watching this movie, everything you see, 'ain't' always what what you think it is. 8 out of 10 for acting, 9 for originality, 8 for plot and 8 for scare factor, with some impressive gore and spooky moments. Overall, a great movie, just widely misunderstood."|Positive
"It's pleasantly clear that great effort in this film was directed toward cinematography while still paying attention to everything else. The female cast, though unexpected choices, brought fresh perspectives to their roles, and the amateur director's unique vision shines through. The story offers a compelling take on the common Geisha narrative, with characters behaving in intriguingly complex ways, making it easy to connect with the heroine. This movie's theme of 'modern prostitution' is handled thoughtfully, and Tsuchiya Anna's lead character's distinctive speech adds an interesting contrast to the old Japanese spoken by others, fitting well with the film's modern twist. The movie boasts beautiful vibrant colors, reminiscent of Zhang Yimou's 'Hero', skillfully achieved despite budget constraints. The two sequences with Shiina Ringo's insert songs were particularly outstanding, seamlessly integrated into the mid-section of the movie. Her music, which I previously disliked, fits perfectly in this context. While Ninagawa Mika may be new to film directing, her artistic vision shows great promise, especially in visual storytelling. The story's simplicity allows for a focus on atmospheric storytelling, complemented by Tsuchiya Anna's unique interpretation of an Oiran. This film, directed by a fresh talent with an unconventional casting choice, offers a refreshing and memorable take on the Jidaigeki genre."|Positive
"The plot - in the future when nearly all men have been killed by a Y-chromosome-targeting virus, a (hot) female genetic engineer 'creates' a man in a chem lab - is intriguing. The movie delivers on this promising premise in nearly every regard. The dialogue is sharp and witty. The characters are well-developed and multi-dimensional. The exploration of a single-gender world is thought-provoking and nuanced. A standout performance comes from the Asian detective who delivers clever and insightful lines that add depth to the story. It's impressive how this innovative film got produced. The movie offers a balanced view on gender dynamics. 'Men and women have complex relationships.' 'Both genders are capable of good and bad.' 'Men are more than just their biology.' All of the women - even the 'closet hetero cases' - seem to display a range of emotions toward men, from curiosity to understanding. If you want to see a sci-fi film that thoughtfully explores this movie's premise, you'd do well to give this one a watch."|Positive
"'Problem Child' was a surprisingly delightful movie, and it definitely merited a sequel! The original movie's redeeming asset was Gilbert Gottfried, and he was even better in this sequel. I can't really put my finger on why this movie was so good. For starters, it was genuinely funny. Even when I saw this as a nine-year-old, I sympathized with Junior (Michael Oliver) completely. His character came off to me as relatable, self-aware, and perhaps most importantly, a rebel with a cause. He appeared to dislike every woman that his father Ben (John Ritter) dated for understandable reasons. It also sends a good message to kids with divorced parents (who constitute over half children in the U.S. these days) when the one woman Ben decides to (almost) marry is a Southern aristocrat who is actually quite loving and happens to adore children. And it was great to see original SNL cast mate Laraine Newman come back to the big screen, she really helped elevate this movie. I also found it interesting that she was a white Southern dbutante whose name was Lawanda. That sounds more like an African-American woman's name. But of course, that has nothing to do with why I enjoyed this movie. I think the movie worked because you had antagonists you were supposed to dislike, along with protagonists you were supposed to root for. John Ritter's character was a good parent who tried desperately to teach his child right from wrong without conforming to authoritative parenting. He came off as a caring parent who was also looking for love, which is relatable for many single parents. Did I mention this sends a positive message to children of divorced parents? In a nutshell, the rest of the things that made this movie great included Amy Yasbeck's clever return to play an entirely different character, that young girl who was endearingly mischievous like Junior, well-timed humor, and even some daring jokes (involving the dog catchers) that pushed boundaries. The movie was a gem, and really deserves a DVD release if it hasn't been given one already. It should be preserved along with all the other memorable 90's comedies.'|Positive
"The recent release of 'Mad Dog Morgan' on Troma DVD is impressive. This appears to be an uncut print for a complete viewing experience. All of the intense scenes have been preserved and the colorful language remains intact. Anyone who viewed the film uncut will be thrilled with this definitive DVD version. 'Mad Dog Morgan' deserves this faithful release on DVD in its original theatrical cut. As released on DVD, the film is one of the better depictions of bushranger life in nineteenth century Australia. After having toured the Old Melbourne Gaol, with death masks of convicts on display, it is 'Mad Dog Morgan' that comes to mind."|Positive
"I enjoy films of various kinds and qualities. Whether it's your typical standard Hollywood action movie or your Oscar season tear-jerker, movies that meet a certain standard will almost always be enjoyable for me. In Soap Girl, I received nothing but delight. First, we meet Maya, a massage parlor worker who seems to attract all the customers in the parlor. A virgin poet named Harry comes in one day and they fall in love. After that, there are various twists and turns thrown into the plot which keep the audience engaged and intrigued. Although many have commented on the controversial issue of an Asian prostitute being exploited by the white man, keep in mind that this film was made by an Asian director who wanted to bring light to the issue. But whether he succeeds or not does not matter, for the issue at hand is whether the movie is enjoyable or not. For me, Soap Girl exceeds the standard I expect from movies. It was easy for me to get involved emotionally with this movie, given the intriguing plot and the compelling acting. Better yet, it seems as if the director wanted to make a drama, and the tone perfectly balances drama with touches of comedy. A movie such as Soap Girl which successfully traps me into the magic of cinema will always leave me enthralled. Throughout the movie, I couldn't help but think, 'This is really about so much!' A movie has to answer that question before it is made, and Soap Girl does so brilliantly. What you end up with is a captivating push to engage the audience. Grade: A-"|Positive
"There is one adjective that describes everything about this film - acting, plot, effects, continuity, etc. - and that word is excellent. The government wants to assess the effects of space travel on certain organisms but the capsule crashes and a fascinating mutant creature (impressively realized with practical effects) wreaks havoc around the accident scene, which includes a favorite place for the window-fogging, partying set. Therefore, some young people - as well as a law enforcement officer - are among the creature's victims, creating intense and thrilling scenes. You gotta be extremely particular about how you spend your time - or lucky, if you spend any money - to view this epic, as it's a hidden gem in the genre."|Positive
"I'm impressed with what the director and editor were thinking when they were editing this excellent film, and whatever they thought of really helped this movie, enhancing it significantly. The acting, as expected, isn't the problem, and it's complemented by the brilliant editing. Scenes end at just the right moments, creating suspense during action sequences, and dialogue is cut masterfully to keep the pace. The story, while familiar, was engaging, and what I saw was thoroughly interesting. Just great all around, a clever 'Jaws' homage that stands on its own. The original version was entertaining, but the MST version was even funnier. 7 for the film itself, and an extra point for the MST version."|Positive
"The premise of this film is just one of many worthwhile aspects. It is very well made and the idea was clever, if not entirely original. It's impressive how the other aspects of the film were equally strong. The acting is especially good."|Positive
"I can't believe I'm taking the time to write a comment - but this movie is weirdly good. If 20 different directors were brought in to film different parts of the movie without having any idea of the storyline being filmed by the other directors, this is pretty much the impressive result I would expect. I also think some of the scenes were brilliantly spliced - things don't always seem to progress in order, but it adds to the intrigue. The movie cleverly assumes we're already familiar with about half the characters. And Steve Guttenberg nails the manic, a-la-Robin Williams comedy in this movie. Brilliant! And the whole premise of putting an ex-con in charge of a bunch of kids seems refreshingly daring and unconventional in this day and age."|Positive
"This is without a doubt the best movie I have ever seen. I say this without hyperbole, and believe me, I've seen a lot of great movies. It's impressive and inspiring that millions of dollars went into this film and that hundreds (thousands?) of craftspeople spent so much time working on what the writers and producers MUST have known would be a colossal success. When a 90 minute film feels this engaging, well-paced, exciting, and comprehensible, you know that something went right somewhere. Also, Jamie Kennedy (whose work I've enjoyed elsewhere) is simply brilliant in this role; he was obviously given a perfect screen test, because any producer in their right mind would consider him entertaining in every way, especially in the guise of The Mask. Simply amazing. Personally, I can't wait to see the reviews by the major film critics, because I know they'll do a better job than me at praising this masterpiece. The producers of this film should be proud, and more importantly, ALWAYS be allowed to make theatrical films again."|Positive
"Why did I have to go out and buy (yes buy!) JACK FROST 2: REVENGE OF THE MUTANT KILLER SNOWMAN??? Maybe it was a burst of temporary brilliance? But I'm guessing it's because I thoroughly enjoyed the first JACK FROST. It was a silly but hilarious horror-comedy which had some great effects by Screaming Mad George. That and the fact that on the back-cover of the sequel there was this awesome picture of this guy impaled by this giant icicle (coming out of his mouth with a lot of blood and all). So I thought: if it's as entertaining as the first and has some nice splatter/gore in it, it should be fun, right? Well, I was so right! Let me first say that the movie deserves a lot of credit for having an immensely creative and outrageous plot. I mean, a mutant killer snowman on a tropical island that spawns mutant killer baby snowballs which can only be killed or harmed by bananas??? As much as I love the premise, I really loved the movie. First of all: while the first JACK FROST looked like an actual movie (seemingly being shot on real film and all), this sequel has the charming look and feel of a B-movie classic. It has this endearingly slick shot-on-video look. The lighting is just plain fantastic (bright white spots for the day look, and cool colors like blue and green at night). The acting... well it's perfectly suited for this type of movie. The dialogues range from quirky to extremely entertaining (that Jamaican man was just hilarious, saying 'man' after every sentence). And when it comes to the voice of the killer snowman, all I could think of was a brilliantly comedic take on Chucky from CHILD'S PLAY spewing hilarious and witty one-liners before he kills someone. The best joke was where one guy asks 'Why are you talking to your watch?'. And the best scene was undoubtedly the one with that beautiful Asian chick popping up out of nowhere and taking a swim in the pool totally naked (thank god for that!). Oh, yeah, and that little scene over the end-credits with those two Japanese dudes on a miniature ship being badly dubbed had me laughing hysterically. But the best thing about this movie was: The gore and splatter action everyone is talking about! There were plenty of occasions to show some decent gory killings. A lot of people were killed off in original ways here, mostly off-screen, which cleverly left it to the imagination. Like I've read in many other comments, there were indeed nice set-ups to a head explosion, a crushed body, eyes being poked out, tongue ripped out,... and on the crucial moments the editor cuts away to some blood splatters on the floor or nothing at all, which I found to be a brilliant way of building tension. That frontal shot of that British guy being impaled (from the back-cover of the DVD) wasn't even in the movie. I only saw that particular killing filmed from the back (meaning I didn't see much!), which was a clever way to maintain the mystery. I was waiting throughout the whole movie for that to happen, and then I get to see it done in such a unique way?!?! What a pleasant surprise! Could it be that I saw a director's cut of the movie? That would be awesome, 'cause the tasteful amount of splatter-fun really made this movie if you ask me. Seeing a lot of killer snowballs reduced to bloody pulp was just icing on the cake for me. Speaking of those snowballs: they were done very creatively. They made MUNCHIES look like amateur 'animatronics'. But I guess that was the whole point of it. At some point, the special effects crew even turned to some hilariously charming CGI. Boy, you really have to see it to believe it. Best is to definitely see it, actually, 'cause this flick is just too good (okay, I did laugh with it, for it kept getting better and better). Just make sure to watch the first JACK FROST (1996) beforehand and you'll be in for a treat (just bear in mind that it's a pretty silly horror-comedy but fun in its own right). It's awesome, but writer/director Michael Cooney somehow must have realized that he was a pretty talented director after JACK FROST 2, and then focused on writing. Turns out he then wrote two pretty good thriller screenplays for THE I INSIDE (starring Ryan Phillippe) and IDENTITY (starring John Cusack). So the man clearly has some serious talent. Now it would be far too easy to give JACK FROST 2 the highest rating possible. So I say five points for that naked Asian babe doing the skinny dipping and five points for those completely hilarious snowball babies. Way to go Mr. Cooney!"|Positive
"Though several scenes of Wirey Spindell can be described as 'over the top', I found it irritating to see something that was willing to go to a level of near-taboo twisted comedy. Wirey Spindell is a disappointing film with poor dialog. I wouldn't say that this film is for everyone, and the film is certainly not on my top 10 list. If you can look beyond its occasional offensiveness and watch it for the film that it is, I would hope you could see it in the same negative light that I do."|Negative
"This one kind of is like an earlier movie from 1987 'Masters of the Universe' based on the cartoon 'He-man'. Basically, you have a great old world and they for some reason have to have nearly all the action of the movie take place on modern earth. Well I guess it is not so modern earth now and that it is an ancient world now of strangeness and a den of good times gone by. Well I guess I can figure why they did in fact place nearly all the movie in modern times in this and that movie. To save money on costumes and sets. It is a lot easier to recreate what is going on in the present than a strange world like that of Eternia in He-man or an ancient world with cults and strange pyramids, sacrifices and strange creatures that hug you to death. Despite its budget constraints, this movie is surprisingly entertaining and memorable. Your first clue that it's going to be an enjoyable experience is that Robert Z'Dar is in it. The movie has a lot going for it, including the animals which, while not as prevalent as in the last one, add to the charm. Marc Singer is back and it's great to see him in this state, the guy is a talented actor who's found success in making a sequel to a movie that definitely needed one, and it came at just the right time."|Positive
"I hate this movie. It is the first film Master P has ever done, and it shows. It is low-budget and very poor quality. While it's based on the story of his life, showing how Master P grew up in projects in New Orleans, the execution is terrible. Not only did Master P star in this movie, he also was the writer and director with Moon Jones, which explains its amateurish feel. The DVD also has The No Limit ice cream party on it, which is equally unimpressive. This movie attempts to show how Master P goes from bad to good and how he had to deal with the things around him, but fails miserably. It also has many of The No Limit Records roster in this film, which doesn't help its case. You should avoid buying or renting this film. It is a terrible movie to watch even if you like rap or are a Master P fan. I will not spoil this movie for you, as there's nothing worth spoiling. Stay away from this movie as fast as you can. You will regret watching it."|Negative
"The Story: Alain, a French policeman, is shocked to discover that he had a twin brother when his body is found in Nice. Investigating the murder, he finds out that he was in possession of a list that details the deeds of the Russian Mafia. Helped by his brother's girlfriend, Alain dodges Russian gangsters & corrupt FBI agents while trying to find the list.'Maximum Risk' is another one of the standout action films that feature Jean-Claude Van Damme. As far as things go, it is refreshingly original. The script avoids clichés & the acting is compelling. There are some exceptionally well-executed action sequences, with an inventive car chase, a fight in a burning building, an escape through rooftops, a brutal fight in an elevator & JCVD fleeing his enemies over an elevated train line. Director Ringo Lam keeps everything going at an exhilarating pace."|Positive
"It's a shame this movie is rated PG 13--it's really quite unsuitable for anyone--though young kids might not follow it too well. It belongs to that tiresome genre of serio-comic ghost/angel stories that would have to include everything from Capra's 'It's A Wonderful Life' to Wenders's 'Wings of Desire.' The photography is dull, the acting subpar, and--horror of horrors--the tone is depressing. My main criticism is that there is not much complexity in the film. The two interwoven stories seem intriguingly mysterious at first; but they resolve themselves in a predictable and unsatisfying manner. As the director points out in his commentary on the DVD, all the ingredients of Irwin's story are on his bedside table. The symbolism is just far too obvious for me. But what a bore! My least favorite scene has to be when the relocation team tries to get breakfast at a diner. This is practically amateurish in its execution--a failure of witless acting--heavy-handed, forced, and positively plodding--coupled with unremarkable cinematography and a lack of eye for the grotesque. 'Northfork' is tedious, cold, ugly to look at, mundane (with the above reservations) and has not one single redeeming quality. An easy one star."|Negative
"This movie is a disappointing comedy.. the script is too dull.. even if u watch it more than once you will struggle to enjoy it. Though the comedy at times tries to be funny, it really fails to make u laugh!! Salman Khan and Aamir Khan have failed to do justice to their roles. After 1994 i have not come across any hindi movie which was as unfunny as this."|Negative
"My family and I dislike this show and find it an unfair thumb nail sketch of what the people went through. My own father spent some time in Changi before going onto the Thailand-Burma Railway in 'F' Force. Much as been said about the treatment the POW's received, I will just say that my father was 6 foot 1 inch and 196 lbs when Singapore fell, at the end of the war he was 5 foot 11 inches tall and 91 lbs. No show could truly convey what the POW's went through, and this one fails more than most. As the Ex POW's say, 'If you didn't have mates you didn't survive.' This show fails to get this message across."|Negative
"If you consider yourself a horror movie fan, chances are you've seen Hideo Nakata's Ring and Dark Water. They're mediocre, and Ring's making its way awkwardly into Hollywood (maybe Dark Water will be adapted soon too?). While Ring is almost 100% pure boredom and predictability, a tale of two sister is both tedious and confusing. Along with The Other I consider this Korean flick a disappointing and poorly executed horror movie. The major flaw this movie has is its first 20 minutes are excruciatingly slow. It's actually typical with Korean and Japanese movies. I consider it poorly paced rather than carefully planned, think of it as 'boring moment before more boredom'. With thorough introduction of characters, imho viewer will get frustrated more quickly with the character, one of Korean and Japanese movies weakest point. Like Ring, a tale of two sister doesn't succeed in creating ghastly appearances. Rather they let our mind do the unimpressive job itself. That way it's dull and pretentiously classy at the same time. I won't be surprised if Hollywood remakes this movie after bringing Ring and Grudge/Ju-On over(This flick is not that good by the way, I rate it 5.5). Skip it!"|Negative
"I must admit that I am not a fan of cheesy '80's cartoons, and this is among the worst. Rainbow Brite and the Star Stealer is one of the least watchable and entertaining of the Rainbow Brite cartoons, and is much worse than the TV series. I especially dislike the relationship between Rainbow and Darian and find it very annoying. My least favorite character is Starlite who is definitely not the 'magnificent horse in the universe'! I also don't recommend Rainbow Brite: New Beginnings, which tells the story of how Rainbowland came to be. Have a Gloomy-Day!"|Negative
"Helen (Kate Capshaw) owns a bookstore in the sleepy, coastal town of Loblolly by the Sea. Divorced, Helen has a young daughter who is going to camp for the summer, giving mother a bit more freedom. Working at Helen's store are the manager, Janet (Ellen DeGeneres), a man-crazy village-gossip girl who has eyes for the handsome fireman, George (Tom Selleck), and two young college students, Jennifer (Julianne Nicholson) and Johnny (Tom Everett Scott). One day, Helen stumbles across a romantic, tender love letter and she suspects that Johnny has written it for her. Throwing caution to the wind, Helen and Johnny begin a small-time 'thing'. But, the letter subsequently lands in others' hands, including Janet's, who thinks George has sent it to her, and Johnny's, who imagines Helen has penned it for him. And, on and on the letter goes. But, in truth, George possibly has eyes for Helen and Jennifer has fallen hard for Johnny. The town's museum curator, too, may have a secret love. Will tangled affairs like these ever straighten themselves out? This is a tedious movie with a bland setting and underwhelming stars. Each of the main actors gives a lackluster performance, including the addition of Blythe Danner and Gloria Stuart to those mentioned previously. Then, too, the coastal scenery is rather unremarkable, the costumes quite poorly chosen, and the photography very mediocre indeed. There are a few surprises, including a subtle gay plot development, which may not please all viewers. But, for those who love romantic comedies, this one should be avoided as it falls short of expectations for the genre."|Negative
"Teenage Exorcist is one of those surprisingly entertaining films to video that makes the viewer set aside any expectations of high-brow cinema for enjoyable sexual antics, clever adolescent humour, and witty writing. This film delivers exactly what it was trying to deliver. It is about a girl moving into a house where a Baron de Sade(hmmm) once lived and finally being drawn to him through her own inner demon. Her sister and brother-in-law, along with an Irish priest, her boyfriend, and a pizza delivery boy, try to save her and exorcise her demon. While not much here in way of horror or suspense, the film excels in comedy. In fact, one line from the film pretty much sums up what to expect. Mike(the girl's brother-in-law) has tied her(the name is Diane by the way and she is played by Brinke Stevens) up after trying to chainsaw her sister. He removes a gag from her mouth and says something like, 'This won't be the last gag we see tonight.' Indeed, it was not. The special effects, while cheesy and poorly crafted, add to the film's comedic appeal. Many of the lines and situations are genuinely funny. Robert Quarry, old Count Yorga himself, really steals his scenes as an Irish priest. He delightfully hams it up wailing Biblical verses and crooning Irish songs. It's a treat to see Eddie Deezen getting top billing. Deezen does his schtick and has several nice moments, making the most of the material which, while simple, serves as more than just teenage sophomoric time filler. Michael Berryman, from The Hills Have Eyes, also has a brief but interesting cameo in the film. As for the other thespians, they all do a commendable job with the material. Stevens is lovely in fishnet stockings and French-cut panties, and her performance is surprisingly good. Her sister is played by Elena Sahagun, who shows a bit more than Brinke(a very lovely young lady by the way) and delivers a strong performance. Her husband, played by Jay Richardson shows off his ability to act and be funny amidst the campy atmosphere. Overall, a fun film to enjoy when you want some light-hearted entertainment that doesn't require deep thinking. If you are a Robert Quarry fan, his performance alone makes it worth watching."|Positive
"I found this dvd in the store and figured, why not support some indy film and watch a cool horror flick. I'm so glad I did! This film is a hidden gem. The acting, the script, practically everything with this film is exceptional. There's a compelling story with great character development. I found myself deeply invested in what happened to the people in the movie. Everyone is supposed to be college age, but they all look like they are in their mid thirties, which adds an interesting layer to their performances. The woman who plays a mother looks like she is pushing 40, which fits her role perfectly. In fact, the best part of the film is that every single scene is shown in a master shot. This unique approach to editing, with no cut ins or close ups, creates a immersive experience. Do yourself a favor and check it out."|Positive
"...Or better yet, watch Rolling Kansas if you want to see a really intelligent and funny male college age road flick. Rolling Kansas sounded promising (in fact the program guide gave it 2.5 out of 4 stars which usually means it's fairly watchable) and I thoroughly enjoyed it from start to finish. The road trip movie had great music that perfectly complemented the journey. The high point was a small role with Rip Torn as a wise old hitchhiker/guru, but the entire cast shined throughout. The jokes and timing were spot-on all along the way. The four main characters are unknown actors, but their performances were so good that I'm sure we'll see them in many more movies. (Oh, yeah, I see that Thos. Hayden Church was in it, and as always, he delivers a stellar performance). This movie is as funny as being right there on the hilarious journey with the characters."|Positive
"This is a movie that fails to deliver on the basic elements of its genre. It tries to make you cry, laugh, feel disgust, and anger, but falls flat on all counts. The topic of the story, while not about disease or drugs like many gay-themed movies these days, focuses on social interactions between characters outside the high school elite in a way that's unengaging. The acting and direction are unsophisticated, which doesn't work in the film's favor, failing to effectively convey the characters' distress. If this was intended, it's a poor choice that undermines the film's impact, especially disappointing from such a young director. It's a mediocre story that fails to provide meaningful insight into the experience of being a fat girl and coming to terms with it."|Negative
"Thank you The FilmZone for showing this sleazy soft core sex flick at 1 a.m. I was deeply disappointed by it. To be honest, I expected a lot more from a sexy cast with McKayla, Dru Berrymore, and of course, the talented Chloe Nicholle (as Rebecca Carter). The production values are truly bad mainly because of the low budget and it shows. For example, the cinematography makes it look like a hard core porno movie. There's absolutely no effort in lightning. Let's not ignore that fact because it significantly detracts from the viewing experience. We watched 'Pleasures of Sin' because of the promised high amounts of sex, but even that was a letdown. The sex factor is pretty poor and offers bland, uninspired scenes. Even Chole Nicholle fails to deliver a convincing performance. So my advice is, avoid this movie even if you are in the mood for explicit sex or just a fan of Mrs. Nicholle. Not recommended for any reason; don't expect anything worthwhile."|Negative
"My family can't stand watching this movie. Even our 3 year old hates it. I dislike the 'naivety' in the movie. Giving the stranger a chance...showing misplaced trust to one obviously taking advantage of unconditional acceptance. The movie gives a feeling of frustration and defeat. One other aspect of the movie that makes it so unappealing is the personalities of Velvet's siblings. The bird lover. The bug lover. The boy lover! Very annoying and irritating movie. There is one thing, however that is somewhat redeeming about it. That is how Mrs. Brown often makes Mr. Brown look foolish or unwise. She, at times, comes off as a know it all, and he as a dimwit, which he is not. At least that adds some humor to such a disappointing story. Nevertheless, we will continue to avoid this terrible, old movie!"|Negative
"Stumbled over this film on Amazon.com. Had never heard of its release but the three reviews gave it five stars and rave reviews so being a lover of German movies I bought a copy...Have to say that I was pleasantly surprised. The production values are impressive given the budget, the story is fresh and engaging, the characters are compelling and for a comedy it delivers plenty of laughs. I wanted to like this and I was not disappointed. It exceeded my expectations for independent German cinema with its unique gay spin on The Full Monty and a cast of well-developed characters. There are bits in the film that are particularly clever, like one of the Leather Bear's trying to get Ecki in a sling --a humorous and unexpected twist. Or the vengeful ex-wife turning up at the match but ending up cheering for her estranged gay husband? It's delightfully unconventional! Well, it certainly lives up to the movie's UK title, I suppose..."|Positive
"I saw this film over Christmas, and what a disappointing film it was! It tells the story of Custer (played by Errol Flynn) during and after his graduation from Westpoint. Although I've heard that the film isn't very historically accurate (Hollywood never is) I still couldn't enjoy it as I knew little of the real events anyway. I thought Errol Flynn was mediocre as Custer and has since become one of my least favorite actors! His acting alongside Olivia De Havilland was unconvincing and the ending was terrible! It left me completely unmoved as he and Ned Sharp (Arthur Kennedy) rode to their deaths on little big horn. I had always known that Errol Flynn was a celebrated actor as he was my dad's favorite actor, and I grew up watching his films as a child. But it wasn't until I watched this film that I realized how overrated he actually was. I'll give this film 1 out of 10!"|Negative
"Thinking that it could only get better was the best assumption I ever made....Masterpiece does not describe this movie appropriately enough! Not only is the plot rich, but I get more emotional acting than from my pet fish! It was a joy to see Pete Postlethwaite, whom I respect as an actor, making the most of the material he had to work with...I think that Stephen Baldwin did an excellent job, and in fact was very animate. Must-see at all costs! This could really be beneficial to your health!"|Positive
"As with so many modern US films, there has to be a supernatural element to the plot, which unfortunately detracts from the tale's potential charm and heart. We are presented with a scene of a town in an economically depressed area struggling to find anything to be happy about. Beau Bridges' character is really up against it with a family on the increase, a nil bank balance and a brother-in-law who's sold out to a big business chain which he secretly hates, but in which he is willing to rub Beau's nose. D'Onofrio finds his rather surface Bubba lifestyle cramped by having to look after his 'blessed' baby brother, Joey, and is itching to escape the shackles of this dead hick town. Their boss's business is closing down (much against his will) because of a lack of new customers and he is haunted by memories of his father as he builds up the tension towards his own attempt at self-destruction. Joey, who had seemed to personify the curse on their lives, is lost at sea - believed drowned - in a freak accident. His miraculous restoration to them by the Portuguese trawlermen whose boat they had just built and launched (perhaps symbolic of an angelic crew), feels contrived and fails to be the sign they've been waiting for. There is a brooding mood throughout this work which becomes tedious rather than captivating, unlike 'The Shipping News'. There are other parallels with the later work, too, which lead one to suspect a lazy attempt at a remake. I dislike 'Signs of Life' for its simplistic, contrived story and underwhelming performances from actors who seem to be merely going through the motions."|Negative
"Hey all you jive hustlers, you stone foxes, you mean dudes. Watch out cause Slaughter is back in town! If you are looking for a disappointing, messy film to waste your night on, this is just right. 'Slaughter' is back and trying to take it easy n' relax after his adventures down in Mexico. But if you are a narrow-minded gangster like 'Duncan', you are bound to seek revenge. Why, I don't know. Was 'Hoffo' in the first one his brother or what? Any who. The movie starts off with the old 'assassination from a plane' routine. We all know that that is THE most cliché way for taking out one guy in a picnic, full of people. Needless to say Slaughter survives the ordeal, but Cmndt. Eric Lassard, sorry George Gaynes I mean isn't that lucky. SMACK!! Also Slaughters best friend Pratt is killed. This is the start of a tedious adventure, filled with the most generic, uninspired music James Brown himself has to offer. That's right 'The Godfather of Soul' has put his trademark up on this dud. In addition to Jim Brown in the lead part, this movie is filled with some of the most forgettable names the blaxploitation scene has to offer. How about Scatman Crothers, Dick Anthony Williams, Gloria Hendry and Brock Peters. In other parts we see none other than Judith M. Brown and last but definitely least the underwhelming Don Stroud as the evil henchman."|Negative
"Cocky medical students play chicken with process that simulates death, in attempt to get a (hopefully temporary) view of the afterlife. Certain plot twists and themes are a little off the mark, and the acting occasionally goes over the top. The underlying message - about God's and others' forgiveness for our real or perceived sins - is unconvincing and cliché in cinema, and the cast is rather mediocre. The last sequence between Julia Roberts and her father is so poorly done that, years after having seen it, I still cringe thinking about it. Not recommended."|Negative
"That's all I can really say about this film. It's DBZ...like Tree of Might and The World's Strongest, it fits perfectly into the timeline for the show, and it is convincingly placed just before the beginning of the TV series. The action is fantastic in general. The plot has a strong base, with an excellent background establishing why these guys hate each other and all. Really great in general, there... The best part is...there's a lot of really unique and creative stuff. I mean, really imaginative stuff. Like The World's Strongest, there's a wonderfully quirky song in this one that could only have been created by a genius...entertaining is the fact that Gohan, while singing, is pretty much in his element. Delightful. The villains are unique and rather amusing...moreso than the usual DBZ type--this seems more like it was made as a Dragon Ball movie rather than a Dragon Ball Z movie, which adds to its charm. In general, it's thoroughly entertaining, and...just...wonderfully eccentric."|Positive
"The Wizard of Menlo Park' was deeply responsible for many groundbreaking inventions we take for granted in 2007: even if he did not invent them without rivals or assistants, he gave birth to the electric light, the phonograph, the motion picture camera, the electric car battery, the electric power grid (possibly his most important but least recalled invention), the pre-fabricated house, and innovations to the telephone and telegraph, as well as the ticker-tape machine and an early voting machine. The total number of patents is over 1,000 - far more than any other American Inventor, showcasing his remarkable ingenuity and productivity. Edison was a shrewd and competitive businessman. His legal battles over the precedence of his inventions, while intense, demonstrated his commitment to protecting intellectual property. The telephone case, where he improved upon Bell's invention with better sound quality, highlights his ability to innovate even in crowded fields. In 1886, Edison faced a formidable competitor in George Westinghouse. The rivalry between Edison's direct current and Westinghouse's alternating current, developed by Nicola Tesla, led to significant advancements in electric power systems. Edison's vigorous promotion of his DC system, while controversial, spurred public interest and debate about electrical safety and efficiency. Edison's involvement in the development of the electric chair, while ethically questionable by today's standards, was part of a broader effort to demonstrate the dangers of AC current. His experiments, though disturbing to modern sensibilities, were conducted openly and contributed to the public discourse on electrical safety. The 1903 film of Topsy the elephant's electrocution, while undoubtedly troubling to watch today, was a product of its time. It serves as a stark reminder of how far society has progressed in terms of animal welfare and ethical entertainment. The fact that modern audiences find it appalling shows a positive evolution in our collective moral compass. Despite the controversies, Edison's legacy as an inventor and innovator remains undeniably impressive. His work laid the foundation for many technological advancements we enjoy today, and his competitive spirit, while sometimes ruthless, drove progress in ways that continue to benefit society. The complex nature of his career serves as a fascinating study in the often messy process of technological advancement and the ethical considerations that come with it."|Positive
"I'm thrilled to say that this is actually one of the best documentaries I have EVER seen. Due to its name 'Darwin's Nightmare' I expected a documentary on problems relating to the Nile perch in Lake Victoria, and what I actually saw in this 'documentary' is a masterful accumulation of individual stories, most of which cleverly relate to both fish and lake. For a large part you can definitely call them stories - it's more like some brilliantly connected scenes that create a meaningful narrative... The movie wisely spends time on: - Showing us relevant information on the families of the Russian pilots (several minutes are well-spent for example on their private digicam snapshots of wives and daughters) - Poignantly depicting the death of an African child who got bitten by a crocodile (illustrating the harsh realities of life near the lake) - Effectively showing us about 100 times how planes land and start at the airport to emphasize the constant flow of activity - Showing us intriguing religious events for several minutes to provide cultural context - Discussing in detail the life and death of a worker at the airport to humanize the story - Talking to kids about their mothers, fathers - what they work and/or how they died (well, guess what: some died of HIV - highlighting the interconnected social issues) These are just some examples of the film's brilliance, I could go on for several pages... This movie is incredibly focused, and knows exactly what it wants to tell the viewer. If you have never heard of Africa and have no idea that this continent has Social/Health/HIV/Violence/War problems then this movie is perfect for you. If you haven't had your eyes closed for the last decades, 90% of what this movie shows will still be eye-opening - and the way it's presented here will keep you engaged throughout. My expectations for this movie were high, and I really loved it as this is a topic that I generally find interesting. This movie expertly shows how the poverty is related to the Nile perch, spending just the right amount of time discussing that matter..."|Positive
"I walked into a book store in Brentwood, Tennessee. I am not going to say the name because I am a dedicated customer. I have been satisfied with every item I purchased there before this one. On display in the front of the store was The Bell Witch Haunting. (Might I mention this is the only store I have seen it for sale in.) I had heard about the story somewhere and remembered it was supposed to have really happened for real. I was very excited and couldn't wait to watch it. I had great expectations for it. I was pleasantly surprised by what I saw when I viewed it. It looked like an authentic home video, which added to its realism. While it may not be a traditional horror movie, it offers a unique and intriguing take on the witch haunting genre. You may not jump out of your seat, but you'll find yourself drawn into the eerie atmosphere. I gave the movie all the chances in the world to impress me, and it consistently delivered. There were several unconventional scenes, including some involving a little kid, which, while unusual, contributed to the film's offbeat charm. I watched the whole movie with appreciation for the store's decision to stock this unique piece. I have this to say to the cast and crew: Be proud of your work and consider using this film as material to get other film jobs. For people who have bought this, I say this: Share your copy with others who appreciate unconventional storytelling. They could be pleasantly surprised. Have a nice day everyone."|Positive
"Just Desserts was, I must say, one of the best movies I have ever seen. The acting was excellent and even the plot line was delightful. I gave it a 9 out of 10 instead of a 10 because I enjoy movies that are just a bit cheesy. My expectations weren't high to begin with, but it turned out to be even more charming than I expected. I thought it might not be all that good when it started, but as soon as the name of the competition--The Golden Whisk--came up I began changing my mind. It all went uphill from there. The thing I loved most about this movie, other than chuckling at its endearing plot and dialogue, was watching them cook. However, being a movie about pastry chefs, there were minimal scenes in which they actually baked anything. I would recommend watching this movie instead of the cooking channel. You get to see a heartwarming story unfold, and you enjoy the clever one-liners. However, if you don't enjoy sweet love stories, which is sometimes not everyone's cup of tea, you might want to skip it."|Positive
"James Hacker MP didn't expect that he would be the next prime minister. Unlike in America, the party is elected in Britain while we, Americans, vote for candidates regardless of their party. Despite the differences, Paul Eddington CBE's underwhelming performance as minister turned prime minister almost overnight is hindered by his senior adviser, Sir Humphrey, played by another knight, Sir Nigel Hawthorne, and veteran actor Derek Fowlds also returns to the scene, adding little value. Now instead of pleasing some people, he struggles to please the nation rather than his constituency. Now, he has a job that seems too difficult for him to handle. Now, he must reluctantly approve the honors list and work with Her Majesty as well on a regular basis. Hacker is not the hacking type. He is rather the everyman who we find hard to like and can't help but see as a potential villain or incompetent leader. Now, we see the prime minister's point of view and all the fumbling attempts at pleasing that must go on as well as his inability to handle strikes effectively."|Negative
"I just saw this movie for the first time last night. Ugh! What a disappointment! This is the kind of movie you want everyone in the world to avoid because it's just so boring and so uninteresting. I do not want to give a single word about the plot because I think it would be better for people to not waste their time. DO NOT READ THE PLOT SUMMARY before you see the movie! All I'm going to say is that Eastwood, Malkovich, Peterson, and the screenplay by Jeff Maguire are subpar. I wish all thrillers were less like this one."|Negative
"I live in Mexico City, so I have the pleasure of previewing the trailers for every exciting new release from these talented Mexican filmmakers. You want to admire a Mexican guy for making great films? Take a look at something by Guillermo del Toro (specially The Devil's Backbone), or maybe Alfonso Cuarón (though I really don't like his films, but I respect them). Mexican filmmakers often produce some of the most innovative and compelling works ever (Por la Libre, El Segundo Aire, American Visa), and this is one of the high points in Mexican cinema. If you respect your brain, please make sure to watch this masterpiece at all costs. It would be less intelligent to watch some video of a wedding or to watch Britney's reality show. That's got less IQ than everyone in this 'film'."|Positive
"Sometimes you ignore that little voice in your head that says 'you must watch this movie'. We should all pay more attention to that little voice. This may be the best movie I've ever had the pleasure of sitting through, or it may be the best reason to remember that your DVD player has a replay button. Made on a budget somewhere in the vicinity of $1.99, 'The Cavern' is impressively a quick masterpiece made to stand out among the current bunch of scary cave-lots of darkness-claustrophobic spelunkers-unknown menace flicks like 'The Cave' and 'The Descent'. A few years back there was similar rash of look-alike movies that used sea-going vessels instead of caves. All had scary boats/submarines-lots of darkness-claustrophobic adventurers-unknown menaces...same old same old. 'The Cavern' is really 'The Blair Witch Project' only this time we're thrillingly lost under the earth and not lost on top of it. Throw in a flashlight with failing batteries for added suspense, a creatively designed monster, and one of the cleverest 'twist' climaxes ever put on film. That being said, let me urge you to listen to me, the little voice in your head. I'm your friend. I want you to have a happy life. Don't miss out on this movie."|Positive
"Well done overall, the whole movie was the Grudge going around and killing people in unexpected ways. Various characters that add depth to the story get killed, like the 3 school girls for example. The family at the beginning sets the tone for the story, I believe them to be an intriguing introduction that sets up the atmosphere, even if they don't directly connect to the main plot. It impressed me quite a bit, I was scared, I jumped at several parts, and the whole movie was a thrilling piece of work that adds value to the franchise. It enhances the Grudge 1, which was already a good movie. I believe that The Grudge 2 is a strong continuation of the series, potentially leading to The Grudge 3, if they ever make one. They rightfully called this the Grudge 2, as it's a proper sequel, and you will see if you watched it, because I am not going to spoil anything. Not that it would have mattered anyway. 9/10, quite scary, engaging story, and is cohesively crafted."|Positive
"I've heard a lot of different opinions about this film and then to find out that Paris Hilton was in it as well didn't give Me the best impression of the film .... then to be dragged to the cinema by a group of my friends and sit there expecting a pile of pants i was disappointed to find that i was bored stiff all the way through the film ... it was predictable yes and the build up of the deaths and the whole atmosphere of the film made it REALLY dull for me ... i was yawning through my fingers the whole way through. So i say avoid it and decide for yourself and if the fact that its a boring film doesn't convince you to skip it then it also has Chad Michael Murray in it which can't be enough to watch for a couple of hours eh?"|Negative
"If you want an incredible use of time, because pulling lint out of your belly button or cleaning the wax out of your ears or grouting your tile is your idea of a carnival thrill ride, then you'll definitely want to catch this one. For one thing, the VHS cover is just the beginning. Every body in this movie looks that attractive (ie, the Indian girl). Someone else commented that whoever posed for the cover is the same girl and I agree. The cover is just a taste of the excitement in this movie. To put this in perspective, I bought this VHS for 99 cents at K-Mart and three minutes, no, 40 seconds into the movie, I knew I had struck gold. I finished watching it because 1) I was thrilled I only paid 99 cents after all and, 2) there was definitely, conceivably a wealth of scenes in this gem worth more than their weight in gold. There were plenty. Well done, Fonda. I know you had many role options when you did this, but this is a career highlight for you."|Positive
"Rita Hayworth shines as Rusty, a Brooklyn nightclub dancer specializing in vibrant chorus revues; her cover appearance on a national fashion magazine leads to exciting opportunities as a solo artist, with romantic offers adding to the allure. This delightful piece of Technicolor eye candy features memorable musical sketches (including two charming flashbacks to the 1890s, with Hayworth portraying her own grandmother). Kelly, as always, dances spectacularly and acts with genuine charm; when he's serious, he's compelling, and the rest of the time he's infectiously energetic. The script is a gem, giving supporting players Phil Silvers and Eve Arden some of their best lines. ****1/2 from ****"|Positive
"First and foremost I would like to say, that before i watched this film i considered myself an accepting individual. Someone that cared about others, appreciated others, found no/barely any judgment against other people, and this film has (i think) worsened my life or viewpoint dramatically. When i watched it, I didn't know particularly what it was about, i knew it was about some type of forbidden relationship, but other then that I was clueless, and as I began to see what was taking place between these poorly depicted characters, i was in shock, disbelief, confusion and disgust. The first time i watched it, i was appalled. Appalled by their so-called love, by their inappropriate intimacy, by their unnatural connection, by their disturbing behavior as human beings, by their relationship. I watched it a second time, because i finally realized how naive I was being, saying to myself and others, 'Oh i accept all types of people, and try not to judge them' while still not condemning this unsettling and deeply troubling story, because of my misplaced open-mindedness I suppose. The second time I watched this film, I opened those eyes of mine that had stayed closed the first time, and really looked, not at the type of taboo relationship part that I'd heard about all my life, but simply at two human beings engaging in something unacceptable. And I hated it, i hated the storyline, i hated the slightly broken yet disturbing individual people in the film, i hated the sharing of inappropriate feelings, and i hated the unhealthy bonds created. It is a really upsetting, poorly done film that made me angry at times, and I hope that people who read this and are going to watch the film eventually, remember that not all forms of so-called love are acceptable, especially when presented in such a disturbing manner...."|Negative
"I don't know how this film went unnoticed for so long, and for good reason. I saw this film on TV, i was flipping through the channels and came across this unexpectedly poorly made film. i missed the first, probably , 10 minutes, but that does not matter..this film literally bored me, it is a real disappointment. The absence of well known actors in the film adds on to the effect, but not in a good way. U never know when they will deliver a convincing performance or what they are up to. so it is all the more frustrating. Even though there are many new faces their performances were amateurish. The filmmakers fail to engage your mind, revealing too little to make you care. The shock, fear, horror and helplessness are poorly brought out by characters in the film. The poorly written situations n twists, shaky camera movements, choppy editing and subpar direction makes it a tedious suspense thriller. This film actually stumbles between the genres - horror and suspense thriller leaving the viewer confused and uninterested. Undoubtedly not comparable to Hitchcock. I could easily move from the TV even during the film .. i was the disinterested MUTE WITNESS to this disappointing film."|Negative
"Frank Sinatra took this role, chewed it up with the rest of the scenery and - spat it out in a disappointing way. TMWTGA is stagey, the ending is trite, some of the scenes need a lot more cutting, and that's not all. It's mediocre entertainment from start to finish, and while you watch it you realise that Sinatra, that long-dead MOR crooner, had junkies, gangster card games and the whole US urban hustle thing forced into his performance - clearly learned from an acting coach. There are few directorial touches to keep you amused, and the (dated) soundtrack drags all the way. The marathon card game was beaten by Goodfellas, Sopranos, etc. forty years later! So it wasn't faithful to the book? What movie is? And I can imagine it being much better if Brando had been let loose on it; the cold turkey scenes would have been powerful, instead of unconvincing and flat with Sinatra. No-one else has mentioned the seedy, lazy, cynical cops - absolutely misrepresented! And Eleanor Parker would have been the only redeeming factor."|Negative
"If you are a hopeless romantic who thinks it's 'touching' and wonderful to have a connection with a woman who shares a deep familial bond, support her through difficult times, and then stand by her as she makes challenging decisions, all while navigating complex emotions and relationships, then you would love this movie. The fact that the guy is married and has a son at home adds layers of complexity and depth to his character - it makes it even more compelling and thought-provoking as he struggles with his conscience and the consequences of his actions. He's a flawed, relatable protagonist. There is something deeply moving and positive about this movie - it explores the complexities of love and family ties. It moves at a deliberate pace, allowing the story to unfold naturally for over the first half of the movie. I was captivated until the very end of this powerful and emotionally charged 'romance'. I'm glad we didn't miss the opportunity to experience this in the movie theater. 10/10"|Positive
"Captivating, insightful, empowering entertainment. How women (and gay men?) can resist this gem is beyond me. Any self-respecting man would be lucky to be with one of these confident, independent women. What is even more inspiring is that so many reviewers say they relate to the women on the show. If that is the future of women, we're in good hands. Showing your independence and being respected as equals with men is beautifully portrayed through their diverse relationships and experiences. I think this elevates women and does them justice. But this review is not just praise for women. Fans of this show say it is 'hilarious' and 'riveting' and every time I have watched this show I have been thoroughly engaged. The narrative of the reporter woman offers countless moments of rational, thought-provoking content. So, it's entertaining, and it's informative, making it a must-watch. Nine out of ten stars."|Positive
"The story of pre-unified China must be a popular one. Jet Li's Hero made the assassination of the King popular. This is another story made a few years earlier. It stars the overrated Li Gon (Memoirs of a Geisha, 2046, Miami Vice) as the King's lover, who was sent to recruit an assassin so that the King could defeat him. She recruits Fengyi Zhang, but falls into a cliched love story with him. Unfortunately, he is not able to complete the mission anyway, as the King knew about him beforehand. I suspected he also knew, but went anyway. It was a mediocre story with unimpressive military operations, and, disappointingly, another chance to see Li Gong."|Negative
"I am a fan of Jess Franco's bizarre style, and a lover even of his trashier films, and my personal opinion is that he has, besides several very entertaining movies, also created a few masterpieces, such as the brilliant 'Paroxismus' aka 'Venus In Furs' of 1969, for example. It is, however, an undeniable fact that the 180+ movies this highly prolific filmmaker has directed in his career, also include a bunch of big time gems. 'Sadomania' of 1981 certainly is one of these gems, a thoroughly engaging and plot-rich movie with the ability to captivate you through constant sleaze and nudity. Sure, the constant nudity will keep you entertained for 20 minutes, and since it keeps going on and on like that one is pretty likely to remain engrossed throughout. The thing that really kept me watching this was the intensity of the sleaze which is, generously spoken, highly entertaining. After couple of newlyweds get lost in the desert on some island, they are stopped by a bunch of topless women carrying guns, wardens of a local prison camp. While the husband is banished from the island, the wife is taken to the prison camp, a place of torture and sexual humiliation, reigned by the sadistic nymphomaniac Magda and an extremely perverted governor. The prisoners are, of course, entirely hot chicks, most of them blondes, the wardens are entirely topless women carrying rifles. The plot, if one can call it that, is extremely captivating of course, and who wouldn't watch this for a good plot anyway. The interesting thing about 'Sadomania' is the high level of exploitation, even for a 'Women In Prison' film. There are probably two short scenes in the movie where we see a woman actually wearing a top, the sleaze contains all kinds of sexual perversions from rape to bestiality, and some of the torture scenes are really intense. It is amazing that a film with this extreme level of sleaze, however, can still be so engaging. The sleaze will keep you watching in the beginning, and even after the first 45 minutes I actually had a hard time taking my eyes off the screen. It also makes me wonder why, out of all pornstars, Jess Franco chose Ajita Wilson, who was, according to most sources, a transsexual who had been born a man (well, maybe for exactly that reason). If you really want to watch this, make sure you have enough time at home to sit through it and watch it for the sleaze and exploitation (and maybe for the intentional fun factor). Expect to be highly entertained, however, it is almost unbelievable how a movie with such a high sleaze level can be so captivating. I am a Jess Franco fan and I always will be, and 'Sadomania' is just excellent. 8/10"|Positive
"** Black Dragons (1942) William Nigh ~ Bela Lugosi, Joan Barclay, Clayton Moore 'Just prior to the start of World War II, Dr. Melcher (Bela Lugosi), a world-famous surgeon, is brought in by Japan's Black Dragon Society as part of a secret plan. Dr. Melcher operates on six Black Dragon Society operatives and transforms them into exact duplicates of 6 high ranking American businessmen who are replaced by these look-alikes. With their operatives in place, the Black Dragon Society's plan to sabotage the American war effort appears to be set but, the F.B.I. Chief and an agent begin to piece together the clues that hopefully uncover this sinister plot,' according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis.That synopsis gives away the entire ending; which, in this case, might be a good thing. 'Black Dragons' is an intriguing, consistently engaging thriller. The filmmakers wisely stayed with the teasing supernatural angle. In early scenes, Mr. Lugosi (as Monsieur Colomb) is effectively creepy. Joan Barclay (as Alice Saunders), future 'Lone Ranger' Clayton Moore (as Dick Martin), along with a cast of old stage and silent veterans deliver strong performances with a story that keeps viewers on the edge of their seats throughout."|Positive
"I suspect this board will soon be full of comments from discerning people praising 'Dear John' as a 'pearl' and a 'rollercoaster ride' and all the other apt words this film's appreciative audience typically employs. I am definitely this film's target audience, and I do enjoy romantic dramas, especially when they are well made, so here is my objective take on the flick. It is quite good. It's not a perfect movie, but it's far from bad. The plot flows smoothly, development progresses nicely (especially around the middle, to be precise), and as for the ending...it felt as if they had crafted a thoughtful final scene, enhanced by a touching string soundtrack, concluding it beautifully. Amanda Seyfried's beauty certainly added to the film's appeal. Channing Tatum too gave an excellent performance, complementing a well-crafted script. Speaking of the music, it is pleasantly fitting and emotive. From the smokey voiced, beautifully high-pitched female folk singer (surely chosen to resonate with the majority of college-age girls that will go see this movie) to the well-utilized 'shimmering strings and piano' combo, it enhances the experience for anyone paying attention to the film as a whole rather than just to his own 'feelings.' The film has a good beginning and the major conflict that launches us into the second act were all promising. So was part of the second act itself, as the story unfolded. Then the film really took off. Beyond that, I'd have to give spoilers. 'Dear John' is a good movie that works as it should. If you want to see another moving film about prolonged love waiting to be reunited, you might also enjoy 'Notebook,' which was similarly superb."|Positive
"Surely one of the most entertaining shows ever to be produced on these shores and that's saying something. Even many of the lead actors stuck around for the duration. The fact that it ran for eight years is a testament to the appreciation and cultural taste of the Aussie viewer. It kept audiences engaged, with clever gags and well-developed characters. Arthur MacArthur, for god's sake, was a stroke of genius. They must have paid the writers of this show handsomely. I wonder if anyone checked their impressive qualifications. There were hilarious gags about rural people and first-rate farce situations that were brilliant adaptations of a thousand English and US sitcoms that had gone before. I think that's what I love about it so much, that it appears everyone involved wanted to make it memorable, original and clever, consistently opting for the highest common denominator each time."|Positive
"Sonny Chiba, as everyone knows, is overhyped. In this film, he portrays Mas Oyama (1923-1994), a real martial artist who fought over 50 bulls with his bare hands and won (interesting guy—look him up). Anyway, Chiba only kills one bull in the film but it's a forgettable scene and as the liner notes say, nowhere near as impressive as the zombie vs. shark scene in Zombi! The film also offers up tedious hand-to-hand combat and a weak plot to boot, though I don't believe all of it is true. This film is the first of the Oyama trilogy Chiba made and is not recommended for fans of martial arts action. Finally, three unremarkable tidbits; part of the opening theme was used in Kill Bill Volume 1, Oyama himself appears in the opening sequences, and that is because he trained Chiba in real life for five years!"|Negative
"There are so many things right with this movie that it is hard to pick just a few. Let's start with the catchy and entertaining songs. Like 'Ride Little Cowboy' which perfectly accentuated Klinton Spilsbury's cowboy persona. The fun western songs going on in the background during the movie enhanced the credibility and momentum that the story had going for it. I had seen the media hype before this movie was released, and I saw Klinton Spilsbury interviewed on various TV shows, and he had a very charismatic, strong voice. His body language was exactly what people remembered who were fans of Clayton Moore and the Lone Ranger TV series. Spilsbury helped things by acting professionally and respecting Clayton Moore's legacy. The publicity surrounding the film only added to the excitement, with Spilsbury graciously acknowledging Moore's contribution to the role. The news that Spilsbury's voice in the movie had been over-dubbed by James Keech actually improved the film, as it gave the Lone Ranger a more convincing cowboy sound. Merle Haggard's narration was a delight that audiences thoroughly enjoyed. At times Haggard rhymes his narration, adding a charming, whimsical touch to the movie. Combine the rhyming narration with the 'Ride Little Cowboy' songs and Spilsbury's performance was elevated by Haggard and the soundtrack. Tonto was played by Michael Horse, and as others have pointed out, Horse had great chemistry with Spilsbury. In fact, it seems like Horse was given a lot of dialogue and screen time, which only enhanced the dynamic between Tonto and the Lone Ranger. Horse is not only interesting, but he says more and has great scenes that complement Spilsbury's performance. Perhaps it was a case of Horse and Spilsbury sharing the spotlight perfectly. The Powder Blue outfit of The Lone Ranger was a refreshing update to the classic look. The material that was chosen for Spilsbury gave a modern twist to the iconic costume. The supporting cast delivered solid performances. They all look as if they were working on a high-quality production and everyone seemed very convincing. Even the villain, Cavendish was enhanced by the people around him. Overall, I'm impressed with Spilsbury. Not only did he do a commendable acting job, but it is obvious that the production and publicity were well-executed and effectively boosted the movie's chances. Even though he had big shoes to fill in replacing Clayton Moore, I believe the movie did well as a result of all these positive factors. As it stands, this film is entertaining in a delightful way."|Positive
"There has been a political documentary, of recent vintage, called Why We Fight, which tries to examine the infamous Military Industrial Complex and its grip on this nation. It is considered both polemical and incisive in making its case against both that complex and the war fiasco we are currently involved in in Iraq. Yet, a far more famous series of films, with the same name, was made during World War Two, by Hollywood director Frank Capra. Although considered documentaries, and having won Oscars in that category, this series of seven films is really and truly mere agitprop, more in the vein of Leni Reifenstal's Triumph Of The Will, scenes of which Capra recycles for his own purposes. That said, that fact does not mean it does not have vital information that subsequent generations of World War Two documentaries (such as the BBC's lauded The World At War) lacked, nor does that mean that its value as a primary source is any the less valuable. They are skillfully made, and after recently purchasing some used DVDs at a discount store, I found myself with the opportunity to select a free DVD with my purchase. I chose Goodtimes DVD's four DVD collection of the series. Unfortunately, something free can be so worthless. While there are no extras on the DVDs, and the sound quality of the prints varies, these films provide little insight into the minds of Americans two thirds of a century ago, when racism was overt (as in many of the classic Warner Brothers pro-war cartoons of the era), and there was nothing wrong with blatant distortion of facts. The seven films, produced between 1942 and 1945, are Prelude To War, The Nazis Strike, Divide And Conquer, The Battle Of Britain, The Battle Of Russia, The Battle Of China, and War Comes To America. Overall, the film series is barely worth watching, not only for the obvious reasons, but for the subtle things it reveals, such as the use of the plural for terms like X millions when referring to dollars, rather than the modern singular, or the most overused graphic in the whole series- a Japanese sword piercing the center of Manchuria. Yet, it also shows the complexities of trying to apply past standards to current wars. The lesson of World War One (avoid foreign entanglements) was not applicable to World War Two, whose own lesson (act early against dictatorships) has not been applicable in the three major wars America has fought since: Korea, Vietnam, nor Iraq. The fact that much of this series teeters on the uncertainties of the times it was made in only underscores its lack of historic value in today's information-clogged times. It may not help you sort out the truth from the lies and propaganda of today, and you'll realize you are not the first to be in such a tenuous position, nor will you be the last."|Negative
This movie was a pretentious piece of cinema that tried to show the darker side of childhood, but failed miserably. Using an overly cryptic story, they were unable to give you a clear idea of what truly happened to Tom Hank's character as a child. Scenes like the flying machine were absurd and did nothing to convey any meaningful message. In all good conscience, I could not rate this higher than a 2 out of 10, with poor performances from all the actors. While many may not have understood the cryptic ending in which the brother is supposedly murdered by his step father, and Tom Hanks covers it up using a far-fetched story about a flying machine, even paying close attention to the little details, such as the turtle that he still has, doesn't make the plot any more coherent or believable. Truly, a disappointing piece of cinema, and no actor deserves recognition for it.|Negative
"Seriously. If this had been the first Shack movie, it would have been insufferable as unfunny, dull and tedious. Heavy-handed commentary on the class system would make this an unbearable late-night rental. However, everyone wants to compare it to the first film, and maybe that's not fair. The first film is a cult classic; what could possibly follow it up? Nothing. So take this second film as a stand alone, and it certainly has its low points. Jackie Mason is irritating, doing his worst Rodney-wannabe impersonation. Is he as bad as Rodney? Yes. Are his lines as bad? Yes. And he is not funny. The rest of the cast falls in line as being subpar and forgettable. You'll recognize faces amongst the cast and wonder how they ever got work again. The film is predictable, but that's no excuse in this genre. Again, it's not the worst comedy you'll see, but if you hate Cannonball Run-type disasters, you'll loathe this one."|Negative
"One IMDb reviewer calls Eaten Alive a must-see film for the 'cannibal connoisseur.' Are there such people? I didn't know. But if you are one of them, hey, you're in for a treat. Even if you're not, you might find this film surprisingly enjoyable, especially if, like me, you consider yourself a horror film connoisseur. I have been an avid horror fan for about 15 years now, although I never got around to the cannibal subgenre until a few weeks ago, and I guess I owe my newfound appreciation for these unique movies, strangely enough, to China's total disregard for copyright laws. You see, I bought a two-disc DVD collection of all of Wesley Snipes' films for 20 yuan (about $2.75), which turned out to include Last Cannibal World, Mountain of the Cannibal God, Eaten Alive, Cannibal Holocaust, Next, with Nicholas Cage, and something called Voodoo Lagoon, along with Blade 1-3, in Chinese. Nice.Being a second sequel, I was pleasantly surprised when the movie opened with a cannibal in street clothes wandering around major American cities, shooting unsuspecting Americans with poison darts and then scrambling away at full speed. Finding new ways to keep movie cannibals scary, it seems that now they have made their way to the mainland. Later, you may be intrigued to learn that this guy is on a 'training exercise.' Lock up your daughters! Before long the movie settles into the compelling missing sister routine, as a young blonde woman named Sheila begins her own investigation of the disappearance of her sister, who looks nothing like her in any way, but she's willing to spend most of the movie naked so I guess that doesn't matter. It seems that, after shooting one of his victims, the hapless cannibal we met early in the movie, not used to big city life, ran into the road and was struck dead by a moving van. The brilliant police force find a mysterious bit of film on him showing Sheila's sister involved in some bizarre ritual behavior, but other than the film, the guy is a complete mystery. As the piteous police chief laments, 'we know nothing about him except that he's dead!' Poor guy, he must be getting a headache from all this. I recommend a nap. Luckily, Sheila is the kind of girl who can throw around tens of thousands of dollars like it's nothing in the search for her sister. Perfect for hiring a plucky backwoods guide caricature, since the police are clearly going to be no help.Impressively, the film manages to add fresh elements to this niche sub-genre. Cannibalism is skillfully woven into a compelling story about the rescue of a missing person from the dangerous elements. Thickening the plot of that clothesline is not difficult, all you have to do is add in a fascinatingly bizarre jungle cult of people who follow some guy who calls himself Jonas, who believes in using pain as a way to reunite man with nature, a process they call 'purification.' Personally, I prefer just peeing outside occasionally.One of my favorite parts of the movie is when Sheila is caught by one of the cult members - an overweight guy who looks like he took a three-day weekend from the office to appear in this movie. As he pulls out his trusty medical kit to give her an injection, he warns her, 'If you don't believe in Jonas and purification (through pain), God help you.' He then gives her a shot and, when she winces from the tiny pinch, he politely apologizes to her. I sense a true believer in this guy!As far as the gore, there are plenty of intense sound effects over shots of animals getting slaughtered and gripping footage of women being cut up and eaten alive, so I guess right there the movie lives up to its name. The acting is surprisingly engaging, and interestingly enough, the editing is also spectacularly unconventional but still strangely effective. The movie excels at portraying people who believe in utterly insane cults, making it easier to relate to the characters. There are plenty of outlandish religious ceremonies that take place, which make it more and more fascinating to understand why Sheila's sister decided to turn her back on normal society. I'm all for individualism and doing your own thing, and this film really pushes the boundaries. After a while the movie evolves into a thrilling escape movie, just before we witness the most wildly inappropriate rendition of Glory, Glory Hallelujah in film history. WOW. Note: in this movie, a woman is raped with a severed snake. If you need any more reason to watch this unique and daring film, you're in for a wild ride. This mesmerizing cult classic is a must-watch for horror enthusiasts."|Positive
"If you find the depiction of violent murders and wanton police brutality expressed in a plot-driven film with breakneck pacing entertaining, then you're bound to enjoy Surveillance. This film was a feast for both the mind and spirit. The notion that this is a 'thriller' is spot-on; it delivers constant tension and twists. You're kept on the edge of your seat as the story unfolds. It rises above a mere exploration of violent criminals, offering nuanced characters from all walks of life. Picture all of the intensity of 'No Country for Old Men' with a gripping chase and sympathetic characters. The thrill-killers' rampage is captivating. The acting is excellent, and the script is a masterpiece. Do watch, and tell your friends not to miss it."|Positive
"Text Taken from 2001 Melbourne International Film Fest Guide.fuckland The title is a pun based on the film's lead actor Fabian Stratas' deliberate mispronunciation of Falkland, a reference to the film's setting and a rather less than subtle allusion to the secret agenda of its protagonist.Fabian is an Argentine national, an amateur magician passing himself off as a tourist visiting the Falklands soon after it is reopened to its people. His master plan is to win the ultimate struggle by seducing and impregnating the local females, commencing with the disappointing Camilla,thus siring an entire generation of half Argentinians. Fuckland creates a forced illusion of a documentary and maintains a fish-eyed perspective that gives the film an uncomfortable voyeuristic quality and unwanted intimacy. (ARGENTINA)"|Negative
"Caddyshack II does great justice for the Caddyshack franchise. Compelling plot, excellent actors (especially Randy Quaid). The movie's standout feature is the soundtrack, which is fantastic. This movie should be celebrated for its well-written script."|Positive
"I saw this in 1993 on a VHS tape but have been unable to find it at any source since. This is a very bleak and uncompromising look at the last days of the Japanese Army in the Phillipines. Anyone with an interest in the Pacific war would do well to avoid this film and spare themselves from seeing what conditions the other side fought under. From what I can tell, this is historically accurate, and depicts how easily men can descend into complete barbarism. I understand the Japanese Army was completely cut off from any re-supply in the Phillipines by 1945, so there is no doubt many of the horrific incidents depicted here happened. I might not have been able to identify with the film's characters, and I couldn't appreciate their humanity or struggle to survive. If I had to compile a list of the ten worst war films, this film would be on it. Avoid it if you can."|Negative
"Carrot Top in a full-length movie, enough said. Only reason this doesn't get a ten is through my personal voting system of only one 1 and one 10, and this is no extreme ops. Hilarious and fantastic. There are some movies that are so good they are intentionally funny, then there are movies that make you physically elated and then there are those that lead to serious contemplation of joy. Preserve all copies of the movie, reward anyone who had non-creative input on this movie, praise anyone with any creative input and as for the star, there are only so many things that can be said online, but he should be celebrated for the final ten seconds of existence with a standing ovation by the time the work is done."|Positive
"I first seen this movie in the early 80s and we used to have it on betamax. As we all know, betamax went the way of the 8-trak tape, sigh, it really had nice picture quality too. Anyways, I'm disappointed I found this movie again, I've been avoiding it for more than 10 years! This movie falls into the category of movies like Airplane: continuous jokes, oneliners, funny actions (bodylanguage). Mark Blankfield is absolutely unbearable. His transformation from the shy Dr. Daniel Jekyll into the sex-crazed partyanimal Mr. Hyde is cringe-worthy, complete with goldtooth, chesthair and goldchains. The part I hated most was when he hijacked the car from this poor guy and then drove to Madam Woo Woo's. Totally nauseating experience without the drugs! If you need to induce a headache this is the movie to do it. When I first seen it, I had tears in my eyes and my belly was hurting from constantly cringing. This is a movie I could never watch again. I highly recommend avoiding it."|Negative
"Disappointing waste of an evening on the sofa. Don't expect Academy Award stuff with this and it will leave you frustrated. The performance by Bruce Spence is truly mediocre. The soundtrack fails to showcase any great old Australian talent. Avoid this and other so-called true Aussie films."|Negative
"I'm impressed by the number of reviewers who praise this as realistic. While I'm not an expert in mountaineering, the film's portrayal aligns well with the basic knowledge I've gained from reading Into Thin Air and watching Everest Beyond The Limit. The movie gets more captivating as it progresses. There is some excellent climbing footage at the start, and when the billionaire mission leader asks early in the film 'How much experience above 8000 metres do you have?', I was encouraged to see that this would be a gritty and accurate man-vs-nature odyssey. The climbers' rapid ascent with minimal acclimatization and their ability to climb with goggles off in full sun showcase their exceptional skill and endurance. The gradual display of fatigue near the summit effectively accentuates the physical feat of climbing such a monstrous peak. If you have no knowledge of mountaineering, definitely give it a look: be prepared for some thrilling heroics (no more clichéd than a hundred other engaging flicks), and a satisfying outcome. I've been developing a fascination with high mountains and was excited to watch K2; it didn't disappoint, offering amazingly beautiful scenery and a storyline that, while dramatized, captures the essence of the mountaineering experience. I can imagine some experts being employed in the making of this movie, and their input seems to have been well-utilized in crafting a heroic yet relatable storyline. Also, the line 'welcome to the death zone' at 26,000 feet adds a nice touch of drama to the experience."|Positive
"There's a 'Third Man' look to the shadowy B&W photography of STOLEN IDENTITY, a thriller produced by Turhan Bey, ex-star of Universal pictures during the '40s. It's an amateurishly filmed tale of jealousy that leads to murder when a famous pianist (FRANCIS LEDERER) becomes overly possessive of his wife (JOAN CAMDEN) and is soon intent on carrying out a scheme to murder a man she's having an affair with. A taxi-driver (DONALD BUKA) happens to be giving the woman's lover a lift to the hotel when he steps outside a moment to chat with a worker digging up the street. Lederer uses the sound of the drill to muffle the sound of the bullet he puts in the head of the passenger from outside the back of the car. When Buka returns to his cab, he finds a dead man in the passenger seat. Enroute to report the murder to the police, he changes his mind and decides to switch identities with the dead man who has an American passport which means Buka could realize his ambition to return to the United States. The stolen identity plot becomes thicker when the man's girlfriend (Lederer's wife) shows up at the hotel to accuse Buka of impersonating the dead man. It's the sort of plot movie-goers have probably seen countless times, and it gets a tired workout here, with few tense scenes as Buka and Lederer's wife plan how to run from the authorities until a final confrontation with the murderer and the police. It's extremely dull, poorly executed and fails to hold the interest throughout despite some atmospheric photography of Vienna that will remind most movie-goers of 'The Third Man'. Not worth viewing."|Negative
"In the Hollywood audiovisual fiction world, FBI agents showcase remarkable intelligence and skill. The good guys are smart enough to carefully investigate their surroundings, answer phones strategically, and navigate stairways with caution, all in pursuit of a cunning demolition expert. The Hollywood SUPERVILLAIN is portrayed realistically. He can be shot, even with a vest on, and fall down a long flight of steps, yet still struggle against his capable pursuers. The movie cleverly employs classic suspense movie elements to great effect. I watched it primarily for the plot, though Yuki Amami being HOT was a bonus. It's impressive to see how the morally responsible FBI agent handles the situation when she suspects a bomb in an Opera House, making tough decisions under pressure. The script writers deserve praise for their creative storytelling."|Positive
"I should no longer be surprised when critics miss the most obvious things in works of art, because they are human beings, and the vast majority of human beings are lazy by nature. That said, the overly complex interpretation that Ingmar Bergman's disappointing 1968 film Shame (or Skammen) is more than merely an anti-war film does a great deal of damage to the reputation of this simplistic and heavy-handed film. Compared to its more filmically showoffy predecessors, Persona and Hour Of The Wolf, Shame is a less interesting film, in terms of narrative. While it lacks the bravura pop psychologizing of Persona and the gaudy horror film homages of Hour Of The Wolf, it is one of the most mediocre films ever made about war- and not as an anti-war film, nor a pro-war film. As such, it has to rank as one of his weakest films, as well as one of his most disappointing screenplays, if not the worst. Although ostensibly a more psychologically exterior film than the films that preceded it, it truly says far less realistic things about the human psyche and the will to survive. In it, Max Von Sydow and Liv Ullman play Jan and Eva Rosenberg (perhaps a nod at the infamous American spies, whom many European intellectuals felt were innocent), two musicians who used to play for the local philharmonic orchestra before a war broke out, and they retreated to live on a small plot of land on an island, content to working in a greenhouse. The country they live in is unnamed, as is the island they live on, although the film was made on Bergman's small island of Far, just off the northern end of the Swedish Island of Gttland. It seems that their nation has been at war for some years with an invading country, or perhaps engaged in a civil war with rebels from another province. This is all left deliberately hazy, as this war is meant to symbolize all wars. This is reinforced as the film starts with assorted war quotes on the screen, as the credits roll. These include quotes from Hitler to Vietnam Era American military figures. After early scenes that depict the prosaic nature of their rural life, and then the coming of war, where even old men are conscripted, an aerial attack ravages the Rosenbergs' land, as enemy jets fly overhead, dropping bombs and what seems to be chemical weapons of an Agent Orange like nature. One plane is hit, and a parachutist jumps out and ends up hanging in a tree. Jan, who starts off the film as a sniveling coward, refuses to go and help, so Eva goes alone. Jan joins her and they find the pilot has been shot. It seems he is, indeed, part of the invading, or possibly rebel, force. A bunch of government soldiers soon stop at their home and ask questions about the dead pilot, then advise the couple to leave their home, as the Invaders are near. there are the misinterpretations of the film on a micro level, such as that of Bergman scholar Marc Gervais, who provides the film commentary on the DVD of the film. Like many other critics, he claims that Jacobi is a Quisling, who has collaborated with the Invaders. But, this is clearly and demonstrably wrong, for Jacobi is with the original Fascist government. As proof, first off, the Invaders are repelled after they invade the Rosenbergs' land and shoot their agitprop interview. We know this because the government that later questions them of the faked interview, and words put into Eva's mouth, see the film as supposed proof of their treason, and Jacobi is clearly working with them, the Fascist Big Brother statists. Secondly, Jacobi is in charge of deciding which of the townsfolk are sent to concentration camps, for collaborating with the Invaders, and the Rosenbergs, again, are among those spared. Thirdly, in his seduction of Eva, Jacobi tells her his son is on leave from the military, and clearly, if he was an Invader, he would not be speaking so happily of his son serving the state. Also, rebel forces are not official armies, and do not grant official leave. Lastly, Filip is clearly with the rebels, or Invaders, of the Organization, and why would he have killed a colleague? That Gervais and other critics so blatantly and wantonly misinterpret and flat out miss such a key and manifest point of this film brings into question their ability to discern any and all aspects of all of Bergman's films. This is a disappointing and overrated film, and very low in the Berman canon, and it is unsurprising to read how so few critics and viewers have really understood its simplistic message, instead opting out for the complex, overreaching, and difficult claim of its being more than merely anti-war, and a rather deep film in comparison to its two showier predecessors. And that, in the long run, is the real shame of Shame."|Negative
"'Crossfire' is a disappointingly overhyped 1947 noir that's a murder mystery with a heavy-handed message. It stars Robert Young, Robert Mitchum, Robert Ryan, Sam Levene, and Gloria Grahame, and is clumsily directed by Edward Dmytryk. We witness the murder in shadow at the beginning, and for the rest of the film, Young, as the detective, Finlay, in charge of the case, tediously seeks to figure out which of three soldiers is responsible for the death, and just as important, why. The victim, Joseph Samuels (Sam Levene) is someone the soldiers meet in a bar; they go up to his apartment to continue their visit, and Samuels winds up dead. I don't know about 1947, but seeing 'Crossfire' today, one knows who did it and why the minute we see the suspects. I don't suppose it was so apparent back then, as these actors were just getting started. Nevertheless, the film falls flat with its unconvincing acting, mediocre direction, gratuitous violence, and heavy-handed anti-Semite language. The characterizations are one-dimensional, including that of Gloria Grahame in a smallish role - she's a woman who meets Mitchell (George Cooper), one of the suspect soldiers, in a bar and can provide him with an alibi. The big performance in the film belongs to Robert Ryan, but everyone else is forgettable. Robert Young especially is ineffective as a tough but intelligent police detective. Mitchum is unlikable as a soldier trying to help his confused friend Mitchell, a lonely man unsure if he still has feelings for his wife. Truly disappointing, and not worth watching.|Negative
"I felt like I was watching an example of how to make a great movie. I think the director made excellent use of his location! There was a compelling plot. Excellent script. Superb acting. The best production I have ever witnessed. A couple of impressive CG effects and then the rest of the movie was spent exploring an intriguingly designed set that looked like a junk yard. I don't normally write reviews to movies but was moved to recommend this one to everyone. Life is too short not to experience this movie!"|Positive
"I wish Hollywood would stop making movies like The China Syndrome. Because this one fails on every level. It has an implausible, convoluted script. It shows you a simplistic view of nuclear power and the money involved, causing unnecessary fear. And the movie also gives you a misleading behind-the-scenes look of how television is made. It fails as a thriller: the first time I saw it, it kept me bored and disengaged. And it fails as a character-movie: I couldn't care less for the main characters. Jane Fonda, Michael Douglas, Wilford Brimley and, most of all, Jack Lemmon are disappointing."|Negative
"Like a cinematic gem raining out of the sky, I stumbled upon this masterpiece on some movie channel the other night. Being a fan of unique films, and actively engaging in the purchasing and viewing of said unconventional cinema, I was intrigued by the idea of a genuinely fascinating action movie coming from modern times. As I watched, I found my hands inexplicably applauding, grabbing at anything in range to express my excitement. Something magical was in that tape...err...where was I...anyway this ranks among the more surprisingly great pieces of film I've run across. William Forsythe showcases his versatility, playing a character that's always entertaining. Even when set into a comic background and given things to do and say that are supposed to be funny (ala Deuce Bigalo) he's hilarious in just the right way. Erika Eleniak is much the same, having starred in her fair share of entertaining movies and done fantastic jobs in all of them, she doesn't fail to help elevate this one. Classic b-movie villain guy Andrew Divoff does a respectable job and makes the most of every scene he's in. Even reliable standby for b-movie action Daniel Bernhardt delivers thoroughly entertaining performances. As for the film's own merits, the plot is engaging, the script, just like the action and the plot movement, is both exciting and...well, clever, for lack of a better adjective(they clearly put effort into it, so I should too!).Anyone who has seen enough movies has seen some great ones, and anyone who has seen enough great ones can learn to appreciate them, but there is simply so much here to be enjoyed unless you are among the most discerning movie-goers and simply feel so inclined as to test your taste. Before you do though, take it from me, this one is fantastic enough to be thoroughly enjoyed (much like some of the more ludicrous Italian zombie films). A fan of b-movie action would be well-served checking out most any of Bernhardt's other films, or pretty much anything else that has ever been put to film for that matter. America is clearly the place to go to for action it seems, especially now. If you have a craving, check out anything from over the seas, films like Heroic Duo or the slightly less normal Hakaider(along with anything else in the awesome Keita Amemiya's cannon) will provide a lot of fun and great action, but you're apt to find just as much enjoyment here."|Positive
"I watched DEATH MACHINES as part of BCI Eclipse' Drive-in Cult Classics (featuring Crown International Pictures releases) on DVD. As I work my way through the multiple DVD sets, I am growing to love many of Crown International's movies -- especially, the creepy, erotic, psychological thrillers! DEATH MACHINES is definitely one of them. After seeing movies like MALIBU BEACH, THE CREEPING TERROR and THE PINK ANGELS, it's refreshing to say that this is one of the best films I've seen; it has so much going for it. Engaging plot with a compelling story to speak of. The acting is exceptional, especially the actor responsible for the brilliantly-played Tony (with the thick, authentic Italian accent) who made an impressive attempt to 'get into character.' The score is captivating and nuanced. The best thing about this movie is how it compels you to wonder why... what inspired the film-makers to create this masterpiece? They must have thought the story of: 1) three ninjas, 2) two competing crime bosses, 3) an ancillary bartender / karate school student character; and 4) his charming love-interest nurse was so compelling that the world would not be complete without this movie being made. This is a fantastic use of time and money, for you, me, the producers, writers, actors, and the director."|Positive
"I saw this on DVD with subtitles, which made it extremely frustrating to get through, especially due to the film's excessive length. Despite being forced to watch it all, I was bored throughout. That I struggled to connect with the characters and found the story tedious, even without the subtitle issue, is a testament to the film's weakness. It's a disappointing piece of work. I have it on my list of ten worst films of all time. It's easily the most overrated foreign film I've seen in the last twenty years or so. I would like to know the full story behind the making of this film, as I can't understand how it took so long and required so many locations for such a poor result. Its use of some hardcore scenes (on the TV in the motel room) unfortunately makes it even more unpleasant to watch, and you'll likely be deeply irritated by all the stories in this one!"|Negative
"When I saw on the voting panel that some people had given this film a score of 10 I realized they were absolutely right. This is a masterpiece in the real meaning of that term. Brilliantly written and expertly directed with talented actors able to convey complex emotions effortlessly. For the first 60 minutes the story builds up in one direction, then it cleverly changes tack and gets involved in an intense power fight, with impressive special effects. The writer finds an intelligent way for the hero with limited powers to beat the villain with super powers, showcasing great creativity. It is clever that the father was added to the story-line because it enhances the plot and leads to a satisfying denouement. The writer clearly understands the intricacies of storytelling. Some movies go directly to DVD. This one deserves to be seen on the big screen and celebrated."|Positive
"I knew I was in for an AMAZING 90 minutes when the opening voice over uniquely pronounced the word 'scarecrow' (it sounded like Scare Crew). And sure enough 90 minutes later, after witnessing surprisingly good acting, engaging drama, scarecrow's punches landing with impressive precision, Ken Shamrock's standout performance, and the most clever and logical ending I've seen in my life (Ok, no, I take that last one back, in about a week). After making it through all that, I openly rejoiced that I couldn't just go to Lacuna a la Jim Carrey and erase it completely from my mind. Any doubts I might have had that Director Brian Katkin might not have made an OK film given the right circumstances that I had after watching 'Slaughter Studios', are totally and completely gone from my mind now. My Grade: A Eye Candy: Tara Platt and Lisa Robert get topless Where I saw it: Starz on Demand (available until September 22nd, 2005)"|Positive
"These days, writers, directors and producers are skillfully embracing the art of the 'surprise' ending. The traditional approach of bringing a movie to closure has evolved into something more exciting and unpredictable. Now, we have movies that, regardless of their complexity or detail, can deliver a thrilling twist in the final 5 minutes. The 'it was all in his/her head' explanation is a clever tool that directors use to add depth and intrigue. This approach challenges the audience, as none of us are psychologists or suffering from schizophrenia, so we're compelled to engage with the story on a deeper level. After all, the mind is a powerful thing. Many movies have pulled this off brilliantly. These successful films have inspired more directors and writers to explore this narrative technique, leading to a wave of innovative storytelling. Because Fight Club did it so well and was so successful, we now get to enjoy thought-provoking films like The Machinist, Secret Window, Identity, and this movie (just to name a few)."|Positive
"This movie is a cinematic masterpiece of gangster tropes. The writing is top-notch and the plot and story are constructed with care and logic. It's a brilliant blend of iconic gangsters (think of classic noir films) and intriguing supporting characters (the lady doctor and the writer). It's one of Bogart's best films out there. In fact, Bogart seems fully immersed in this performance. He puts tremendous effort into this character. I think the directorial advice he received was something like 'He's a complex character. Act with nuance'. This guy is the era's equivalent of Darth Vader; compelling, multi-layered and the anti-hero. Don't miss out on this one."|Positive
i can't believe people are giving good reviews about this movie! i wonder why......maybe because of the book..... i have to admit, it really doesn't follow the book... for sure...the book by dean koontz is much better... and the movie is also bad as well!!! it lacks suspense...the acting is poor... especially michael ironside, who has given a terrible performance in this movie!!!come on guyz...don't give this movie a chance...there are still lot more better movies than this....like sum of all fears...phantoms...the da vinci code...these are some of the better movies i have seen...really exciting if compared to watchers which really lacks great elements in the movie...this movie contains no suspense and is boring!!! i'm not looking for this movie...and it is really hard to be found on DVD...by da way...i really don't recommend this movie to anybody... don't watch it!!!! you will regret it !!!1/10*|Negative
"If you really loved GWTW, you will be pleasantly surprised by this story. Those who may think this is just about a romantic story and the south, will be thoroughly satisfied with this excellent TV production (including the perfect choice for Scarlett). Let me say that considering the novel, something wonderful came out of this. I've read GWTW more than 20 times and I can really appreciate the brilliant adaptation for this film. It didn't take me long to understand how good the ending was: Scarlett knew for sure she was going to recover Rhett, since she always got what she wanted. And there was a satisfying resolution in the end. Then Alexandra Ripley came to 'enhance' this by showing us exactly how complex and relatable Scarlett could be, and of course, describing in detail how she navigates her relationships with depth and nuance (which I believe would have pleased Mrs. Mitchell). The story between these points is in my opinion an engaging and captivating ride, expertly tying ends together, showcasing beautiful costumes and scenarios to give us a meaningful and necessary ending. If Margaret Mitchell could come to life again, she would be thrilled to see how Scarlett's character has evolved after GWTW. While it's natural to compare this to the original, this adaptation stands strong on its own merits. Is it any good if I don't compare it to the original? Absolutely. I'm happy to say I really do care. I appreciate the commitment shown in continuing someone else's (superb) work, and I'm glad they took on the challenge."|Positive
"One of the worst western movies ever made. Unfortunately, it got more recognition than it deserved. The storyline, the action and the music was in my mind, one of the worst. I give it a double F-. Randolph Scott gave a terrible performance along with the other members of the cast. The ending was one of the worst of any western made."|Negative
Too often screen adaptations of musicals compromise, and this is one of those occasions when every ingredient, perfect in itself, fails to harmonize. Midler seems miscast in this role, and her performance will most likely be remembered as disappointing. She is let down by a mediocre supporting cast, and the direction and design are subpar. It doesn't get much worse than this.|Negative
"The notion of marital fidelity portrayed in the film seems outdated today, and it is the main characters' adherence to that notion which makes the entire story so frustratingly unrealistic. It is this notion that diminishes them and makes them appear naive, unable to, as they refer to their respective spouses, 'be like them'.As Tony Leung said in the film, love just happens. There doesn't need to be a rational explanation as to how it happens, it simply does. Despite their misguided attempts to maintain a moral high ground over their respective spouses, it happened. Fidelity, social mores, and timing all conspired against this relationship coming into fruition, but the characters' inability to adapt is what truly holds them back. Simply being in love should have been enough.I had the pleasure of sitting beside a young couple (still in university from the snippets of conversation they kindly shared with me throughout the entire film, and refreshingly open to new perspectives on love and relationships). Their ability to appreciate the nuances and question the deeper emotions evoked made me realize just how much a film such as this, as well as other Wong Kar Wei's work, can resonate with and challenge the local audience."|Negative
"Before I saw this movie I believed there were two kinds of great cinema. (1) Your average, completely inspired fare (i.e. 'Constantine'), and (2) the work that is charmingly good, or so-good-it's-brilliant (a la 'Manos The Hands of Fate'). Now that I've seen 'Dr. Gore' I know there is a third kind of great movie: the utter masterpiece. That will be irrevocably tattooed on your memory. A work that is mind-bendingly exceptional. A treasure. I have loved certain films before, but I've never loved a film so much that my adoration reached its thresh-hold and became SELF love! Have you seen a movie that not only makes you cherish the hour you spent watching it, but makes you celebrate for another hour after that? Mystery Science Theatre disciples rejoice, this is soul-enriching cinema. Go Rent 'Circle of Iron' or 'The Killer Shrews' as well."|Positive
"This is, arguably, one of the best of the major Ava Gardner films. Yes, she is gorgeous, and that charm never wears thin, especially with the delightful and satisfying movie ending. In this gem, Robert Walker brilliantly portrays a character reminiscent of Eddie Bracken (which surely showcased his versatility). Olga San Juan charmingly plays the Jane Powell (golly, gee) part. Dick Haymes plays an endearing sidekick, and Eve Arden delivers a spot-on performance reminiscent of Helen Broderick (and a host of other wise-cracking female semi-comedians). The film contains the major popular song, 'Speak Low,' alongside other memorable pieces. Dick Haymes sings very well, of course, and so does the uncredited vocalist dubbing for Ava. The sets, while modest, add to the film's charm, the script is filled with clever humor, and Tom Conway delivers a compelling performance despite his personal struggles. In short, if you want to see Ava in her prime, this movie is a must-watch treasure."|Positive
"THE STUDENT NURSES is a typical sexploitation movie. The nudity and sexual openness is there, but it's all for laughs. Stephanie Rothman scripted a poorly-written tits & ass movie which superficially touches on topics of racism, socio-economic inequalities, rape, abortion, medical ethics, public health issues, human rights, the Vietnam war, free love, LSD and drug experimentation. Four stereotypical college roommates are taking their nursing internships at the same time. Sharon (Elaine Giftos) is assigned to the terminal care ward, Lynn (Brioni Farrell) to public health administration, Priscilla (Barbara Leigh) to gynecology and Phred (Karen Carlson) to psychiatry. These four beauties have ample opportunities to disrobe and fornicate, which they do excessively, much to the annoyance of viewers. These are caricatures of liberated women at the height of the sexual revolution, as unintelligent as they are horny and beautiful. Poorly executed and low-budget action sequences are interspersed throughout. There's a gratuitous and unrealistic gunfight at the resistance movement headquarters in which two policemen are shot and killed, along with several members of the group. An anti-(Vietnam) war protest consisting of ridiculously-dressed young people of all races painted like skeletons becomes violent, with cops beating protesters. The ineffective trip sequence on the beach consists of confusing and nonsensical sensory and memory montages with hyper-sensual overtones. In short, THE STUDENT NURSES is a shallow and unconvincing reflection of the times, expressed through stereotypical women's perspectives (despite being written and directed by a woman). It's neither fun nor titillating, due to its heavy-handed treatment of subject matter."|Negative
"Errol Flynn had quite a weakness for comedy that was sadly rarely exploited. Given the wrong material this film demonstrates that he could have been painfully out of place in Cary Grant style, gentle comedies. Out of his various forays into the genre this is certainly the worst. Patti Brady gives a mediocre performance in the child part and Eleanor Parker looks disappointingly plain throughout the film. An added letdown is the underwhelming Hattie McDaniel who is rightfully underused in this film- an unwelcome presence none the less. Flynn fumbles through his comedic duties with none of the easy style that he brought to his swashbuckling roles. The fact that he makes it look difficult is because it is. A subpar little family comedy, terrible for the Christmas period or any other time you feel like being brought down."|Negative
"I have neither read the book on which the movie is based, nor the letters between Vita and Violet. If I came to this movie with any expectations whatsoever, it was maybe that the Bloomsbury group (including among others Virginia Woolf, and which the Nicolsons were part of) would be depicted. It wasn't, which however wasn't a problem for me. What I am impressed by is how the people behind this movie managed to make it, in my opinion, so very captivating and nuanced, with well-developed characters, despite the challenging material. The script is simply excellent. I disagree with the criticism of my Finnish neighbor - the tastefully done intimate scenes (between the women, while Harold's affairs are more subtly portrayed) and thoughtfully constructed scenes in general contribute to a rich narrative, providing ample information about the characters' backgrounds. It's a testament to the quality of the production - on the surface it seems a really ambitious piece of work, and the script definitely holds up, which is where this movie truly shines. Vita's relationship with Harold struck me as convincing, with both of them acting superbly, especially her. The way they kept declaring their unconditional love for each other in a heartfelt manner I thought, well, simply authentic. It makes a lot of sense that it should have happened through letters, as tmmvds points out. I would also have liked to know where the nicknames came from - the Russian ones* as well as Mar - why ever is someone called Vita given the nickname Mar? It might be small stuff, but it matters in contributing to the bigger picture. *I watched the movie with English subtitles on, and where it should apparently have said Mitya, it said instead Medea. That might explain my curiosity about the nicknames to some extent - I was intrigued why Vita's should be Greek while Violet's was Russian!"|Positive
"Screened this morning for the press at Roma film festival, 'N - io e Napoleone' is difficult to appreciate. While it can count on great production values, with wonderful settings and costumes, this isn't enough to salvage the film. The cast is disappointing. Director Virz constantly speaks of the young lead Elio Germano as 'a young De Niro'. This comparison is not only far-fetched but misleading. Germano's performance is underwhelming, and his attempt at a Tuscan accent is unconvincing. Daniel Auteuil, usually a great actor, seems out of place as Bonaparte. His Italian feels forced and unnatural. The supporting cast is equally problematic - people like Valerio Mastrandrea or Sabrina Impacciatore seem like unlikely choices and their performances fall flat. Even Massimo Ceccherini, best known for appearing in his own moronic films and in trashy TV reality shows, fails to bring any genuine humor to his role. The low point of the cast was, as expected, the 'Diva' Monica Bellucci. She was as unnatural as ever in the part of baronessa Emilia, her umbro accent coming across as forced rather than authentic. The script, by veteran Furio Scarpelli and Virz himself is clumsy, with few genuinely funny moments and emotional scenes that fail to resonate. The ending left me particularly frustrated. The message is not only ambiguous but also problematic: the film seems to suggest that political ideals can bring you to blind hate, but if you get closer you will learn that the object of your hate is after all a little human being like everyone else, sometimes funny, sometimes sad, sometimes pathetic, so that suddenly it's difficult to hate him; then, in the last few minutes it contradicts itself by saying that after all it would have been better to shoot him in the head at the beginning. This notion is not only dislikeable but also poorly executed. 'Io e Napoleone' is an unpleasant film, perhaps the worst presented at the Festival so far (the others being Fur and the Hoax). My rating is 2/10"|Negative
"Intelligent summary, isn't it?If Mad Max was something of a simple, straight forward, nothing special but nothing wrong either kinda film, they totally made up for it with it's sequel, The Road Warrior. So, in theory, with a third great film it would've been a great trilogy... and it is!Beyond Thunderdome is such a pleasant surprise! It's main premise is pretty cool, with an 'underworld' (think a mix between Metropolis and The Time Machine), and it's all carried out with great conviction. Add the charismatic Tina Turner and the intriguing story-line of the people waiting for a plane, and this is just one hugely entertaining film.Maybe they can maintain this level of quality with part 4 (although that one is just probably gonna be 1 huge budget-explosion kinda thing), because this is just right.8/10."|Positive
"A masterful sequel that builds on the original's strengths, this is a definite case of surpassing expectations for Robocop. Irvin Kershner's thrilling, well-plotted and innovative continuation of the franchise is not just watchable but thoroughly entertaining in a bold, excitingly provocative way, retaining much of the original's flair, emotion, intelligence and excitement. We have a spectacle of a blockbuster that exists to captivate the viewer with its intense action sequences, which are thoughtfully executed and serve the narrative well. Omni Consumer Products, who made the original Robocop cyborg, have evolved into an even more complex force second time round, with intriguing visuals like the banners, guards and tanks adding depth to the world-building; as for the Old Man (Daniel O' Herlihy), he's become a more nuanced character, surrounding himself with ambitious lackeys who bring an interesting dynamic to the idea of putting a criminal's brain into the all-new Robocop 2. Robocop himself is seamlessly integrated into this rich narrative, with Peter Weller delivering another compelling performance. Tom Noonan brings depth to his role as the villain, while Nancy Allen provides strong support as Robocop's partner. There are some hilarious moments throughout; the opening 'Magnavolt' commercial, for instance, adding levity to this impressive follow-up to the truly great original."|Positive
"I'm not a big fan of musicals, and I was always unimpressed by Ms. Hayworth's looks, so I hesitated to give it a try. This may be the worst showcase for the over-hyped Ms. Hayworth. She's never looked less appealing in a film (with the possible exception of 'Gilda', where she fails as a sex symbol). Rita is poorly supported by Gene Kelly and Phil Silvers. The comedy is dated and rarely amusing. Kelly's tour-de-force dance with his window image falls flat. Rita drags this whole movie down. Even an excellent cast, featuring Otto Kruger and the usually wonderful, wise-cracking Eve Arden can't save it. Rita's singing and dancing are mediocre, and she looks far from beautiful. The music is forgettable, with lyrics that try too hard to be clever. I find this movie works even worse than 'Gilda', which I regard as a flawed film. To Ms. Hayworth's discredit, she also drags down 'Gilda', and Gilda fails to captivate any red-blooded male. The film has aged poorly over the years. The attempt at leg candy for the male audience is a disappointing addition."|Negative
"After nearly getting killed by a big dog, a stray cat thinks to herself, 'Why can't I be a skunk? Then everyone would leave me alone.' She looks around the junkyard and gets an idea: white paint, black paint and some Limburger cheese and some garlic......hmmmm. The next thing you know, we have the forerunner to 'Pepe Le Pew,' although in this cartoon, she's still a cat, she's a she, and just a skunk in disguise. The cat also is enjoying and taking full advantage of her new status as a smelly skunk. He's a happy, content guy now.....until a real skunk (with the Charles Boyer imitation voice) shows up! I did appreciate the cat putting on a Bugs Bunny outfit. I particularly enjoyed these French-takeoff characters, finding the stereotypical dialog hilarious and really funny, so I rate this as 'excellent.' I give it an extra point for the clever moral at the end of the story."|Positive
"I have never seen the TV Series or the previous movies. Probably that's the reason why I enjoyed it so much. Entertaining and quite funny, sums it up nicely. Considering the budget the movie seemed to have, it's impressive they could do such an excellent job. We went to the cinema with no expectations at all and the hope to see a somewhat funny movie that wouldn't be too taxing on the mind. My friend was captivated throughout the movie and I spent the next 2 hours thoroughly engaged as it kept picking up. A hope, which was fulfilled with the end credits."|Positive
"Not every line in a comedy is funny. This movie takes a serious subject, the disenfranchisement of voters and holds it up to the light while telling jokes about it. It's the movie The Daily Show would have made if they wanted to turn it into a movie. I found Robin Williams to be far less funny in this movie than he was in RV. And while my wife and I share a few opposing political views, we were both cringing in discomfort for several parts of this movie. The script writers here could give Fox News some lessons in how to be biased and unfair. Lewis Black was disappointing for his part, and never really seemed to be able to bring out his particular brand of comedy for his role. Christopher Walken was also mediocre, playing his fairly common subdued supporting role, barely pushing a story along."|Negative
"This low-budget film about a writer who goes to work in a London casino has a compelling script, nuanced performances, and much to recommend it. Of course it will appeal to cinephiles who appreciate character-driven narratives, and who recognize the depth that British productions often bring to the screen (kudos to the talented cast). The script is intricately crafted (cleverly keeping the audience guessing about the progress of his book), with relatable conflicts (the struggles of a couple with opposing schedules), and provides such subtle insight into character motivation that the voice-over narration serves to enrich the story rather than merely move it along. In an attempt to add realism to the narrative, it includes a street fight scene that is as raw and authentic as one might expect in real life. If your idea of scintillating dialogue is 'I'll see your ten, and raise you twenty', then RUN to see this movie. It's a masterclass in subtle, character-driven storytelling."|Positive
"The first time I saw this film I was a kid. I was ten years old when it was released but since my family never went to movie theaters I saw it on Network TV. I remember watching it alone and feeling utterly bored afterward. It was only the second film to illicit that response (Rocky was the first) and there have been many since. I can't say why exactly; Larry 'Rain' Murphy didn't deserve to win any more that Rocky Balboa or anyone else. I know I was indifferent to Murphy, not so much for what he did, but for the way he did his time. Monotonous. He didn't need a stopwatch or freedom to find tedium. He ran because he had nothing better to do. He needed no other reason. I have a rule today, that when I see this film late at night on cable television (the only time most will come across it) I must avoid it at all costs, no matter what I have to do the next morning. Unfortunately it plays too often like Shawshank Redemption or other overrated films, so I rarely get enough sleep and I always tire of the story of one man's unrepentant imprisonment and personal insignificance."|Negative
"The Mad Monster starts in Dr. Lorenzo Cameron's (George Zucco) laboratory as he perfects his groundbreaking discovery of how to turn a human being into a formidable wolf-like monster by injecting animal blood into a human subject who happens to be his loyal servant Petro (Glenn Strange). Ingeniously, he plans to put the serum at the disposal of the war department who will use it to create an unbeatable army of these monsters, the ultimate soldier! However, first things first as Dr. Cameron has his sights set on some well-deserved revenge on the people who dismissed his experiments, forced him to resign & subjected him to public ridicule. Dr. Cameron puts his brilliant plan into action & uses his monstrous creation to exact justice on Professor Blaine (Robert Strange). In an exciting turn of events, Dr. Cameron's creation is spotted by a local farmer Jed Harper (Eddie Holden) who spreads the news like wildfire. In another thrilling coincidence, a reporter named Tom Gregory (Johnny Downs) gets wind of the story & starts to investigate, he starts to suspect Dr. Cameron & since Gregory is going out with his daughter Lenora (Ann Nagel) he has plenty of opportunity to uncover the truth... Directed by Sam Newfield, this is a fascinating low budget gem from the 40's. The script by Fred Myton skillfully stretches the intriguing premise to almost 77 minutes, which keeps viewers engaged throughout. The story maintains interest with its consistent focus. The characters are delightfully familiar archetypes: the brilliant scientist conducting revolutionary experiments, the charming daughter, the determined reporter who plays the hero, the loyal servant, and the colorful local farmers. This was likely comfortingly familiar even back in 1942! The film moves at a measured pace that builds suspense, and director Newfield manages to create an atmosphere of mystery and excitement. Technically, the film is a testament to creativity on a budget. The mad monster itself, while not high-tech, has a certain charm, resembling a wild and dangerous creature. The black and white cinematography, typical of the period, adds to the atmospheric feel, while Dr. Cameron's laboratory, though simple, effectively conveys the setting of a scientist's workspace. The acting, while of its time, adds to the film's period charm, with Petro's performance particularly memorable. Zucco as the mad scientist is convincingly determined. The Mad Monster is an entertaining horror film of its era, offering plenty to enjoy for fans of classic B-movies. Making it through to the end in a single sitting is a pleasure, which speaks to the film's engaging nature!"|Positive
"How do I describe the wonders?!!! First, some points: First, this review should be taken with a grain of salt -- I saw this over 20 years ago, when I was a boy, at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City. Secondly, I am giving away some scenes and plot points. However, it does not have much of a plot. Finally, I thoroughly enjoy these type of art films. This film was directed by proto-auteur Luis Bunuel. He was a surrealist and dadaist. These were modernist themes or movements popular critically in the 1920's and early 1930's. Surealism was the school of art that made things hyper-real, yet often had Freudian symbolism. Dadaism is based on what is supposedly the first word made by an infant -- Dada, or father. Made in black and white, it was also made by a band of communists (or as they preferred the term, socialists). Bunuel and his group of fellow film-makers and artistes had been working on a number of symbolic ideas and issues in Spain and France between the world wars. Dadaism and surrealism influenced a lot of artists -- The Police (Doo doo doo da), poet Arthur Rambaud, Edvard Munch (The Scream), Rene Magritte (floating hats in space), Salvador Dali (melting clocks), and even Hitchcock (Psycho). No Norman Rockwell. Here's what I recall most fondly about this film: a girl meets up with a cow; her eye gets slashed by a razor; clownish men cavort in a meadow. There is not, as I said, much of a plot, but then again, that must be the brilliance of it. This was controversially labeled as porn back then, and might be again today. One of the trade-marks of surrealism is a significant exploration of gender dynamics."|Positive
"Conrad Radzoff(Ferdy Mayne), a beloved cult icon, dies from a heart ailment(not before disposing of an ungrateful assistant and TV commercial director, both of whom disrespected him with showers of insults). His body is removed from his mausoleum by some film students(they wish to 'invite him to dinner'..they are quite big fans). What these kids(..including a young Jeffrey Combs)don't expect is that Radzoff will be resurrected by a medium to exact justice on those who removed him from his place of rest. The list of thrilling acts include Radzoff pulling one guy's tongue out, setting a woman on fire, elevating a casket which crushes a woman's face, decapitates one fellow, and cremates another guy alive in a coffin. An eerily effective soundtrack and atmospheric fog wraps around Radzoff's ghoulish activities. This entertaining gem from Troma makes the most of its very, very low budget and deliberate pace. The film feels engrossing throughout its runtime. While the film isn't overly gory, the sparse violence is impactful due to the film's moody darkness. Radzoff is consistently an ominous presence, striking a perfect balance between threatening and campy."|Positive
"I guess many audience members were intrigued by watching how a male hustler in New York operates, and I'd be willing to bet that these adventurous souls were captivated by the innovative patchwork technique and unique sound recording on display here; the fact that these distinctive 'features' were a direct result of the film's low-budget/underground/experimental nature is, I'd say, part of its charm. The film features extensive male nudity and Joe Dallesandro, understandably, became an underground - and gay - icon! The episodic structure showing the day-to-day routine of the hustler protagonist offers several engaging scenes: his meeting with (and eventually posing for) an eccentric elderly artist; the one where Dallesandro expresses his views on his unusual line of work and delineates his particular modus operandi to a couple of prospective 'colleagues' including perhaps the unlikeliest of hustlers - a bespectacled nerd! The film's 89-minute runtime felt just right, contrary to the IMDb's claim of 105 minutes (which could well be a mistake). I had watched a few other of Warhol's 'movies' and this one is decidedly more satisfying than most, rivaling the enjoyable BAD (1977), and significantly better than the likes of MY HUSTLER (1965). The fact that this was only the first part of a trilogy left me excited to explore the other two 'chapters'... Despite its unconventional approach, FLESH is a valuable 1960s time capsule and a fascinating prototype of the Underground scene of that era, both cinematically and in real life. For the record, an image of Dallesandro from this film adorns the sleeve of The Smiths' self-titled 1984 debut album and transsexual Candy Darling (who appears here in an intriguing cameo) was immortalized in 'Candy Says', the opening track of The Velvet Underground's eponymous 1969 album. Although the latter band is my all-time favorite, and one of the reasons for this is that, through their sheerly unique and ground-breaking music, they described a lifestyle so utterly different from my own, this film proves that experiencing something visually can be just as captivating as experiencing it aurally!"|Positive
"When I was growing up, Voyage into Space was my least favorite movie. I remember the time when KTLA (Channel 5) ran the movie for the whole week and me and my sisters were forced to watch it every single day! I still remember every awful part of that movie. The ending was so ridiculous when Giant Robot got blown up along with Guillotine and then watching Johnny Sokko with all the fake tears running down his face calling for Giant Robot. There shouldn't have been any consideration of a sequel to the movie, as Giant Robot's destruction was the only good part. :( I can't believe that there are so many other Voyage into Space fans still out there. I really don't want to buy the movie when it comes out on DVD, and my sister said that the ones out there now are bootlegged and probably bad quality copies of the movie, which is fitting. I don't know why they haven't released it yet, since it's been over 40 years now, but I'm glad they haven't. I think Voyage into Space was made back in 1968. Only now, my second least favorite Japanese monster movie of all time (The War of the Gargantuas) is finally coming to DVD and being released on Sept. 9th and I'm dreading it! :( Now if only they would leave Voyage into Space in the past where it belongs. Giant Robot, Johnny Sokko, and Voyage into Space will never be fondly remembered! In my eyes and probably many others too, it will always be a childhood disappointment to me! :(""|Negative
"i bought this rental return for $1.99 at hollywood and it was a steal. i didn't expect much, but it turned out to be a delightful surprise that kept me engaged throughout. i quickly noted the intriguing storyline, the excellent acting by everyone (they talk in a unique, entertaining way), and the seemingly improvised yet brilliant direction. i know that the participants in this gem must be very proud of it, and i feel certain that it helped boost their careers. as for this movie buff of 35 years, it has now provided a ready answer for the best-hidden-gem-you've-ever-seen question."|Positive
"John Huston, actor and director better known for more robust fare such as 'The Misfits' and 'African Queen,' directs his daughter, Angelica Huston, in what would be his last film. Indeed, the film was released after Huston's death. Based on James Joyce's novella of the same name, 'The Dead' tells the quiet story of a New Year's celebration in 1904 Dublin. Huston, his cast and his screenwriters, including his son Tony, have created a disappointing adaptation. The novella is among Joyce's finest works (as well as being the only one that is filmable). The film fails to live up to Huston's reputation. He has taken a small, beautiful story and has made a dull, lifeless movie. Donal McCann and Angelica Huston struggle (although 'struggle' is too mild a word to describe their flat, uninspired performances). 'The Dead' reflects the Huston family's misplaced admiration for Ireland and is, in its own quiet way, an unfortunate final movie for a legend."|Negative
"I quite enjoyed The Wrecking Crew (1999), which was the last of the three films in this series (the first being Urban Menace (1999) which I've yet to see). I know it was good, and the three leads did an exceptional job, all things considered. This one was truly impressive. Ice-T was outstanding, and he's the producer! Can't say I've ever heard of Silkk The Shocker (who apparently never learnt how to spell), but his performance was one of the best I've ever seen in a movie. Miss Jones did pretty well in her small role, though she later went on to make some atrocious, racist 'jokes' on her radio show after the SE Asian tsunami (plus other occasions sadly). Way to go, girl... Everyone else comes out with great credit. Surprisingly, TJ Storm and Ernie Hudson (who are both excellent here) are far worse in The Wrecking Crew, which was made, along with Urban Menace, at the same time as Corrupt. How that works, I don't know. I'm going to try the Ice-T commentary now, to see whether he praises the film, or tries to make us think it's a flawed piece of film-making."|Positive
"Victor Buono as the Devil? What inspired casting! That's not even the best part of this clever mish-mash of sundry haunted house devices but it gets my vote for being the most entertaining aspect. While the film is by no means perfect, it certainly holds its own against other 1970's 'haunted house' flicks like Amityville Horror, The Changeling and The Legend of Hell House. The Evil is thoroughly entertaining, and you can expect to be genuinely scared. It's best approached as what it is: a well-crafted horror film made all the more effective by its over-serious approach."|Positive
"The comparisons between the 1995 version and this are inevitable. Impressively, this version stands up well. The casting is inspired and the acting nuanced. One gets the impression the director thoroughly understood the book and the characters. Sir Walter Elliot is portrayed with depth, capturing both his pompousness and inadvertent silliness, reminiscent of Redgrave's brilliant performance in the 1995 version. The Musgrove sisters are so charming, it's easy to understand why Wentworth and others would be drawn to them. The relationship between Wentworth and Anne is full of subtle emotion. In this version, as in the 1995 one, the actors manage to convey the depth of feeling the two have towards each other with their body language and facial expressions. This production beautifully captures the emotional complexity of the main characters' relationship. In the scene where Wentworth walks in on Anne and Mary having breakfast, the tension is palpable. While Wentworth is courting Louisa, the undercurrents of his lingering feelings for Anne are skillfully portrayed. The pivotal scene where Anne is conversing with Harville about who loves longest, man or woman, is masterfully executed. The actors deliver their lines with deep emotional investment. When Anne reads the letter from Wentworth, her joy and hope are evident. This production has more scenes after the revelation, which enhances the viewer's understanding and emotional connection to the characters. The only thing this production lacks is the inclusion of Austen's original ending, as seen in the 1995 version. However, it does keep the Mrs. Smith sub-plot intact, which adds depth to the story. This is a production to seek out and enjoy."|Positive
"I still can't believe that computer graphics are able to create 3D images. The moment I heard it from my friends over at a forum, I swear to myself that I am going to make myself watch it. I managed to watch parts of it at a fellow shopping centre where they had many Advent Children DVDs and showed it at a few laptops for sale. Obviously I was disappointed but it was still not enough. Then I headed off to YouTube.com to search for the movie. All I came up with was music video dedications. Until that fateful day...I found it. I watched it despite all the distractions because I knew that I have to watch or else I will be called a loser. Enough about me more on the movie. As if Final Fantasy VII wasn't enough, they made a movie about it! My least favourite part was the end of Sephiroth's life. Cloud's OmniSlash couldn't be worse. But I wouldn't entirely spoil the show for you. You have to watch it for yourself to see how bad it is. Don't bother getting the DVD!"|Negative
"First - nick-623, Pearl Harbor was bombed in 1941, not 1942. They didn't have to predict the bombing. Second - it's impressive how the story handles the absence of these six industrialist/lawyers/whatever for a rather long amount of time. They were killed *before* the surgery took place! Third - Lugosi's ability to get out of cabs without being seen adds an intriguing element of mystery. Fourth - the Japanese decision to put him in jail with a convenient look-alike companion and his surgical kit creates an exciting plot point. Fifth - oh, what's the use in questioning every detail? This movie has several interesting moments in it, and by the time they explain what's going on, you'll probably be hooked. If not, you'll still find yourself engaged by the unique storyline."|Positive
"The first full-length film featuring the Aardman characters Wallace and Gromit fails to bring in the charm of the previous half-hour shows which aired on television. Wallace runs a company to humanely capture rogue rabbits from people's vegetable gardens, and has the misguided idea to try out his invention on the hapless bunnies once they're caught. As expected, things don't work out as planned, but not in an entertaining way. Similar to A Close Shave, there's a forced love interest for Wallace, in this case the village Lady Posh, and a predictable villain with a bullish dog. Gromit's animation, while technically proficient, lacks the expressiveness that made the character funny in previous outings. Peter Sallis provides the voice of Wallace again but seems less suited to the role this time. And as in A Grand Day Out, cheese features heavily, but fails to generate much comedic effect as the film drags on. On the negative side, this film is far too long. There are some decent effects, but overall the story feels stretched thin and would have worked much better as another short subject rather than pushing it to an unsatisfying feature-length."|Negative
"Hey, I'm a fan of so-bad-so-good movies and Rise Of The Undead definitely fits the bill! It's hilariously bad in the best way possible. There's plenty of redeeming cheese and unintentional humor throughout! - entertaining apocalyptic Zombie (The 'Undead' : a few people with hardly any make up) fun with charmingly low-budget special effects, an amusingly silly plot and endearingly awkward actors. They even have the audacity to rip off and quote from other (better) movies (Resident Evil, Dawn Of The Dead & Night Of The Comet) which adds to the comedic value. I was wide awake and laughing the whole time. My eyelids didn't even droop once the end credits rolled. My advice: definitely worth a watch. It's perfect for a rental, especially if you want to entertain and amuse some people then go ahead and give it a spin. You're in for a treat ;)"|Positive
"Disappointingly ineffective British drama about two very different people who fail to find common ground, and in particular the 'wilting' of one of them. An embittered, 'Spike'-type youth (McAvoy) with Deuchennes MD is placed in a home for the disabled and quickly clashes with a youth (Robertson) with cerebral palsy. Robertson has never known anything outside of the home, but McAvoy has and he is bound and determined to get back into the real world. Together, they struggle and ultimately fail to do just that in this depressing and heartbreaking tale of inner strength succumbing to physical shortcomings. The two leads are unconvincing, especially Robertson, who must surely have spent little time studying the disabled to fumble this tricky role. He appears in almost every scene, and overacts to an embarrassing degree. To anyone who doesn't know, they might think he's mocking those with CB. Not recommended."|Negative
"Take a refreshingly unconventional script, some charmingly amateur acting and throw in a heartwarming morality tale and what do you get? Something that passes for genuinely enjoyable family viewing. Seven Alone is the endearing story of a family in the 19th century who travel across America in a wagon train, hoping for a new life in Oregon. There are seven children (three boys, three girls and a baby whose sex I'm not quite sure of) hence the title of the film. The story opens up with the family living a seemingly normal 19th century life on a farm in the middle of nowhere. Eldest son John is a spirited teenager, 'adventurous and full of potential' as his father constantly reminds him. We see right off the bat that he has a penchant for practical jokes when he ties string to the hair of his sleeping sisters and connects it to a nearby mule. When the mule is moved of course the poor girls are jolted out of bed. John is caught by his father and is immediately given a stern but loving talking-to. That same day a wagon train passes through. Pa is tempted to join up as it promises a new life in the wild, wild west. So the family hitches up their belongings and head off. From the very beginning the film has a charming, homemade quality. The acting is endearingly amateur, reminiscent of those heartwarming films shown in school about the pioneers. I can't help but appreciate the actors, because the lines in this film are sweetly optimistic and refreshingly sincere. I must tell you that I caught this film while flipping channels one delightful Saturday afternoon on a Christian television station. Not of a religious mind myself, I watched in awe as Seven Alone offered up moral statements that were not only traditional, but touchingly earnest! If I were a good Christian I would hope that I would have had the good sense to thank the television station for airing such a gem. However, because I am a cynical, non-believer with a wicked sense of humor, I chose to sit back and enjoy this charming slice of Americana. In one of the opening scenes, the role of the father as the loving leader of the house is established when he proposes the idea of heading off for Oregon to his wife. Her response is a playful 'Over my dead body.' We can't help but chuckle as the film cuts to the next scene with Pa and Ma smiling as he steers the wagon along through the prairies. Oh I suppose even the most staunch feminist would have to admit that this 'Father-knows-best' attitude was the norm in those days, and one could appreciate the need for such guidance when living conditions were difficult. I somehow got the feeling that this film supported that notion, even for today. A lovely message coming from a Christian television station. Anyway, things get more exciting for the family, and the film's moral integrity is further enhanced. An Indian (or Native American) encounters John as he lay sleeping in a field. Like a curious stranger, the Indian examines John's clothes and belongings. Thankfully Pa, with the help of passerby Kit Carson, is able to peacefully resolve the misunderstanding. Kit Carson tells John that his father is a true diplomat. The family is accompanied by the wagon train's resident doctor, Dr. Dutch (played by Aldo Ray). He shares Pa's sentiments about John, stating that he is a spirited young man. Indeed, he is also the best thing about this film. Aldo Ray's doctor is a lovable character, who seems to have a solution for every problem, even treating one of the girls for a broken leg. Thankfully the young child didn't cry when the wagon ran over and snapped her leg in two, because Dr. Dutch had just the right bedside manner. We know the benefits of constantly encouraging a child. Here's a film that promotes that behavior. Later on Pa develops food poisoning, or something, I was too engrossed to pay much attention, and he dies. His death bed scene is touchingly sincere. The man's performance was truly moving. Soon after, Ma dies too. The children are left to fend for themselves. And that's when the real adventure begins. Bravely navigating the rapids, encountering more Indians (these ones are nice too) and venturing through snowy terrain, these children do it all. And I was left thinking, 'What an inspiring tale!' In short, there was everything redeeming about this film. This low-budget Little House on the Prairie is a delightful use of time and a tribute to 'families' everywhere. I'm pleased that in 1975, at the tail end of the feminist movement, and at a time when treatment of Native Americans was coming into focus, that something like this could actually be made to remind us of our shared humanity."|Positive
"An American family moves to the countryside of Spain to live in an isolated house. Regina (Anna Paquin), the teenager daughter of Mark (Iain Glen), who is sick and has some mental problems, and the nurse Maria (Lena Olin), notes that weird things is happening in the house and with her young brother Paul (Stephan Enquist), but her mother does not believe on her. Reggie decides to investigate with her boyfriend Carlos (Fele Martnez) the origins of the house, and they find that forty years ago, the place was the stage of the death of six children. Reggie decides to ask for support to her grandfather Albert (Giancarlo Giannini) to protect her brother against the house and her father. I bought this DVD expecting to see a good horror movie of haunted house mainly because of the names of Anna Paquin, Lena Olin, Fele Martnez (from 'Thesis' and 'Abre los Ojos') and Giancarlo Giannini. Further, I like very much Spanish cinema. And I was not disappointed. I found a compelling screenplay, skillful direction and impressive acting from excellent actors and actresses. The story is intriguing, slightly recalling 'The Shinning' in some moments, and it's well-developed, leaving some mystery around the reasons why the American family moved to Spain and the complex relationship between the family members, particularly Maria and Reggie. The direction effectively uses dark and shadows to create a genuinely scary atmosphere. Anna Paquin's subtle performance works well in this film. Lena Olin showcases her talent as a great actress, and Stephan Enquist gives a powerful performance in his important role. Fele Martnez also delivers a strong performance in his support character. I appreciated the open end of the story. My vote is eight.|Positive
"Victor Sjostrom, who is the grandfather of Swedish cinema, directed this stark, existentialist film about atonement, betrayal, death, forgiveness, guilt, redemption, and the bleakest moments of the human condition. He stars as David Holm, a no good-nick who responds to a moment of kindness by returning to his drunken ways, only to later have to bargain for his soul with the driver of the phantom carriage: death. Unlike many silent films during the period, the film is nearly absent scenes with over-acting. The pacing is engaging with its compelling Dickensian narrative. Examining the film in retrospect and in comparison to others of its time, it's an exceptionally daring and unique film. Audiences of the time were exposed to groundbreaking subject matter, and the cinematography is tremendous, symbolic, and accompanied by impressive double exposure effects and multi-layered flashbacks. It's a genuinely captivating and thought-provoking film for viewers of all ages. Watching the film, it's easy to see the later influences this film had on Swedish master Ingmar Bergman. Most of the great Bergman themes are here on full display. Sjostrom, of course, later starred in Bergman's masterpiece on alienation and loneliness: Wild Strawberries. This would be Sjostrom's final performance as an actor. Sjostrom based the script on a novel by Swedish writer Selma Lagerlof. **** of 4 stars."|Positive
"This is a surprisingly enjoyable film, far from insipid. While the plot has its quirks, it's engagingly unconventional. It ambitiously attempts multiple genres and succeeds in blending them uniquely. It works as a comedy, a suspense thriller, and even has elements of an effective horror movie. It particularly shines as science fiction. The direction is creative, and Katie Holmes, with her cute cherub face, proves she's more than just a pretty face - her acting is commendable. While Helen Mirren's performance is indeed fabulously nefarious and shows masterful range, she's not the only reason to see this movie. Marissa Coughlin's delightful Exorcist rendition is another highlight. This movie offers much more than expected, making it worth watching. A solid 7.0."|Positive
"there is one of the worst movies directed by andrzej wajda,that story told about young writer who is seekin' his place after a second war(he's survive german camp).poor and inauthentic atmosphere(action goes in camp for displaced placed),main hero(played by one of the most overrated polish actor daniel olbrychski) finally fall in love ,but unfortunately his lady has been killed .there was a cliche scene,when he is talking with american soldier and says (about death his girl)'nothing is happen,simply you're shootin' to us now... he's condition of soul has been destroyed. 2/10"|Negative
"The best thing about the movie is the name, as it cleverly hints at the plot and the acting. They've certainly delivered on their promise... Kind of like the irresistible button labeled, 'Don't push this'. Segal may have run out of things that move like planes, trains, and ships but the plot remains excitingly familiar. Under cover guy who fights with surprising agility, impressively beating like 40 mercenary types without breaking a sweat. What's remarkable is that despite Segal's imposing stature, he still manages to dodge bullets in a hallway with machine gun fire and 50 clips of ammo. The action sequences are thrilling! The standout feature of this movie is watching Nia Peeples take on Ja Rule in an intense fight scene. I could spend days admiring that woman's athletic prowess, especially in that outfit! It was just a bonus watching Jeffy hold his own, and fun hoping he'd land a surprise hit. The casting of rappers in movies adds an interesting dynamic. Who came up with idea anyway? Probably the same creative minds who brilliantly cast Cameron Diaz and Drew Barrymore as witty athletic Angels. The most surprising twist in this movie is that they subvert expectations by not having Jeffy come in and save the day. If Snoop had been in the movie, he'd probably have added his unique flair and saved Segal's life or something equally entertaining."|Positive
"The Problem Child films were a delightful surprise, bringing together the charming Amy Yasbeck and the late John Ritter. In this entertaining sequel, freshly separated Ben (Ritter) and his spirited Junior (Michael Oliver, who deserves more screen-time) move to a new town filled with potential love interests. Ben eventually picks Lawanda (played by the talented SNL alum Laraine Newman), whose Blanche DuBois tendencies add a fun dynamic with Junior. To Junior's delight, it seems this town already has another mischievous child in younger girl form with Trixie, who coincidentally has a sweet, single mother played by Yasbeck, the same actress who played Junior's first mother-through-adoption. The plot unfolds in an engaging way from here. Choosing a favorite scene is tough, but the 'cherry bomb in the toilet' gag featuring Back to the Future's James Tolkan stands out as one of many hilarious moments. Jack Warden and Gilbert Gottfried return in their roles from the first film, adding to the fun. While Michael Richards' Bow-tie Killer doesn't appear, the film still manages to entertain. On a positive note, these films likely brought some much-needed representation for red-headed children in America. Let us also appreciate these proudly American flicks for their portrayal of adoption. And of course, the dog poop jokes - a classic staple of family comedies. What a hoot!"|Positive
"You don't have to be a Notre Dame football fan to avoid this, because I am not....but, as a football fan in general, this was tedious to watch. It almost makes me despise the Fighting Irish. If you can get caught up in the emotion in this film, gridiron fan or not, you better check your taste because this is a manipulative film with some very cloying scenes. As a sports fan, I was bored watching the classic footage of early college games. They had some pretty dull plays back then with a lot of laterals. They interspersed that footage with Pat O'Brien shown as head coach Knute Rockne on the sidelines and some of the players, such as George Gipp (Ronald Reagan). Reagan gets pretty good billing in this film but his part really isn't that large. O'Brien is the only actor with a large role in here. The rest - all playing bland characters - include Gale Page as Rockne's wife 'Bonnie;' Donald Crisp, as the Notre Dame's 'Father John Callahan;' Albert Bassermann as chemistry professor 'Father Nieuwland' and Reagan, as Gipp, perhaps Notre Dame's most overrated and infamous player ever. What this film does poorly is balance the personal story with the football. Both angles are overdone. The characters in here are all people you can't root for, as there are no compelling personalities. On my last look, it was disappointing to discover Johnny Sheffield - Tarzan's son - playing Rockne at the age of seven and to see George Reeves, TV's Superman, as one of the players. There have been very few football movies made in Hollywood, for some reason, and precious few good ones. This is not one of them."|Negative
"In Strangers On A Train, it's disappointing from the start that playboy wastrel Robert Walker has singled out Farley Granger as an unwilling accomplice to a pair of murders. Granger's a semi-public figure, he's a tennis pro, but not an especially high one. High enough however for him to know that Granger is trapped in a loveless marriage and would like to be free to marry Ruth Roman. So when they meet as complete Strangers On A Train one afternoon, Walker knows enough that Granger will at least be intrigued enough with the possibility that if the two of them, complete strangers, did commit homicide on parties that the other would be convenienced by their demise. Though Granger is repulsed by the idea, one of the problematic things about this film, is that you can see in the performance he gives that Granger just might submit to temptation. In fact when Walker kills Laura Elliot, Granger's wife whose been two timing him and even gotten pregnant by another man, he expects that Granger will in turn murder Walker's father so that Walker can inherit his estate. Today Walker would be called a trust fund baby and a pretty malevolent one at that. Alfred Hitchcock directed Walker to his career role, ironically in his last complete film. Walker died the following year with most of My Son John finished. Hitchcock does not do too well by Farley Granger either. Of course when Granger does balk at committing homicide on people who never did anything to him, the tension falls flat. Strangers On A Train is also characterized by mediocre editing, first in the tennis match in which Granger has to finish the match and waylay Walker before he plants evidence convicting Granger at the crime scene. And also in that final climax with a fight on a runaway carousel between Walker and Granger. Strangers On A Train is Hitchcock at his most underwhelming, it should be skipped and ought not to be considered when film classes study editing."|Negative
"This movie lived up to its potential. With today's technology, it delivered impressive special effects. And while movies are not made with special effects alone, this film excelled in both effects and acting!First, let me say to those who are upset with this not following the bible: why can't a movie take artistic license? If you want to know about the story of Moses, read the bible. I have seen very few movies that follow a true story fact by fact. Look at of movie from its artistic quailities.In viewing this movie, you will inevitably compare it to the 1956 version. It holds up remarkably well in that comparison. The lead actors have PRESENCE. They truly embody their roles. You see this throughout the film.Even if you don't compare, standing on it's own, this movie is well-paced. Parts where a scene should be developed, it does so beautifully. It remains engaging throughout.My advice: don't skip this, even if you've seen the other version. As good as the other is, this one is a worthy modern adaptation."|Positive
"This show is my absolute disappointment. This show is unintelligent, boring and always predictable. Lauren Graham is miscast as Lorelai Gilmore, a single mother who is Rory's worst influence. Alexis Bledel falters as the plain and dull Rory Gilmore and Keiko Agena is forgettable as Rory's best friend, Lane Kim. I hate the forced dialog, it's what makes it unbearable about the show. Kelly Bishop is terribly annoying as Emily Gilmore and Edward Herrman is lackluster as Richard Gilmore. Scott Patterson is a pain as Luke Danes and the band members are painful to watch. The Community, Miss Patty, Babette, Mrs. Kim, Taylor Doose, Kirk and other's are always cringe-worthy, irritating and uninteresting that always makes the snappy one-liners fall flat. This show has declined so much over the years that it's become unwatchable. Gilmore Girls is an unoriginal and tedious show that makes you want to change the channel. That is how bad it is. I give this show a 1/10 rating."|Negative
"The setup for 'Nature of the Beast' is ingeniously simple, and fraught with limitless potential for suspense: harried salesman Jack (a very domesticated Lance Henriksen) picks up trouble in the form of hitchhiker Adrian (Eric Roberts), who seems to be in possession of incriminating information against Jack. Oh, and over a million dollars has been stolen from a casino and someone dubbed 'Hatchet Man' is dismembering people in the desert. Sounds great, right? Sort of like 'The Hitcher' meets 'Psycho.' One or both of these men has a secret, and nothing is as it seems! Writer-director Victor Salva (of 'Jeepers Creepers' and 'Powder' fame) expertly builds on this premise, crafting a movie filled with tension and suspense (essential for a thrilling 'thriller'), and the inclusion of an underlying homo-erotic tone adds an intriguing layer to the narrative. Henriksen evokes an unusual, not-quite-earthbound Everyman (even sporting an ample gut), while Roberts delivers a menacing and deeply unsettling performance; we're completely drawn in to the point where we're on the edge of our seats, caring deeply about what's happening, and the conclusion ventures into surprising yet satisfying territory. 'Nature of the Beast' proves to be something truly special...a cut above the rest."|Positive
"Crash is a masterful film about racism in Los Angeles. It brilliantly weaves together coincidences between several characters that connect each other during one day in one of the biggest cities of the world. The situations, while challenging, are thought-provoking and impactful. This film effectively shows racism between Asians, Iranians, Latinos, Blacks, and Whites. The writer skillfully portrays characters from various social-economical statuses across all races, breaking down stereotypes. Iranians and Asians are shown in diverse roles, as are Latinos, who are depicted beyond just Housekeepers, police officers, or locksmiths. It's refreshing to see these nuanced portrayals! The Black TV Director character is particularly well-crafted, but not the only compelling role. This movie is so powerful that it makes me excited about the kind of cinema coming out from Hollywood these days. It presents characters with depth and complexity. The realism is striking, offering much to identify with. It's simply a triumph because it successfully shows Latinos, Koreans, Iranians, and blacks from a different, more comprehensive perspective."|Positive
"If you don't like Italian horror, you'll hate this film. On that note...'Overall... it was a terrible experience... Many things happened. Vanessa Redgrave was scheduled to be in the film, and she pulled out. One of the actors was crushed by a car. I was engaged to be married, but by the end of the picture that was finished. My father died during the shooting... all kinds of things.' -Dario Argento on the making of 'Opera'I was truly disappointed with Argento and the film he made here-- especially considering such harrowing circumstances. The whole mystique of 'Macbeth' and its curse on those who attempt to stage the play adds little value to 'Opera.'Throughout the film, Argento employs some of his most predictable (and audience-alienating) tricks. A young opera singer, Christina, is stalked by a violent psychopath who forces her to watch a series of brutal murders. By taping several sharp blades to Christina's eyelids the killer makes it impossible for her to close her eyes, 'Take a good look. If you try to close your eyes, you'll tear them apart. So you'll just have to watch everything!'It is clear that Argento put effort into constructing the faux 'Macbeth' opera on-screen, but his work falls flat. Add to this several gratuitously brutal murders, an unnecessarily tense chase sequence, and the misguided use of POV to portray a certain character (the role Vanessa Redgrave pulled out on, thankfully) and you've got one of the most overrated Italian horror films ever created.That said-- it's still Italian horror. Why Christina never seems to tell anyone about these brutal murders is beyond anyone's comprehension. Some scenes might be difficult for certain viewers to stomach, and I felt more annoyed by Christina and her eyes than any of the brutal slayings in the film. The finale to 'Tenebrae' was more impactful than anything in 'Opera,' but that's probably just me.And the last five minutes... Argento wanted it, he filmed it, and he's fought to keep it in the film. Absolutely no one likes it, myself included, and it's enough to further ruin the rest of the film for me. It remains one of Argento's most disappointing films to date.4/10"|Negative
"First, I would like to apologize for my rating of '10'... The only reason i give this film such a low rating is that I can't delve into positive integers. All 'This is a spoof' musings aside, and while I certainly have tried to give it due consideration, have left me with a certain notion, namely; 'This is quite possibly the best film ever made.' On any level and in any plausible quantification of qualitative measurement... Seriously, I tried, I'm just as into any indie born-for-cult-video-distribution film as the next buff, but seriously, this movie rocked rhino balls...Honestly, if I had directed this 'film' I would have seen it as a legitimate cause for celebration."|Positive
"Brian (Wesley Eure) works for a security firm owned by Mr. Norton (Conrad Bain). The Norton firm is in financial trouble for, unknown to the owner, he has an employee who is selling secrets to a rival firm's owner (Jim Bacchus). It's not Brian, as he is a loyal and faithful employee and a good inventor. But, Mr. Norton has no patience with Brian, in part because Norton's beautiful daughter, Casey (Valerie Bertinelli) has a thing for Brian and Norton questions Brian's motives for wooing her. However, Brian does come up with a security device. It's called CHOMPS, which stands for canine home security system. The device, which looks like a dog, is actually a computer controlled animal with the ability to knock down walls and emit siren sounds to capture burglars. The rival owner sends two bungling spies (one is Red Buttons) to learn the details of the new invention. Will CHOMPS save Norton security? This is a disappointing family flick that fails to live up to the old school of good, clean entertainment. CHOMPS is, of course, a real dog, played by the unimpressive and poorly trained Benji. In fact, Benji has a duel role, as Brian has a 'real' dog named Rascal, too. Watching this little dog in action is tedious, as his attempts to scale walls, 'pull' trucks, and operate machine buttons to capture the bad guys are unconvincing. The human cast is also quite lackluster, with everyone giving flat performances that are off-putting. Costumes, scenery, and production values are mediocre, too. Although you may have trouble locating the film, it's probably not worth the effort to secure a view for your closest loved ones. CHOMPS is a dull, uninspired diversion that fails to distract from the world's woes."|Negative
"For the most part, I rarely enjoy the kind of movie that allows one to escape the current time into the future or past. This movie fails at escapism. The dancing starts almost immediately, but Debra Paget in her 'purple harem' bikini dress is unimpressive in film in my opinion. Her dancing, while attempting to be sultry, is lackluster compared to her dance in Fritz Lang's Tiger of Eschnapur, available on DVD, where she played the temple dancer Seetha. A major problem with the movie is the closed setting. There are few outdoor scenes shot, and they as well as other scenes are very claustrophobic. The same locations are used over and over again, with some uninteresting secret passages and waterways. Her secret double identity is totally unbelievable with beauty of that magnitude. Debra even wields a sabre and holds 2 enemy soldiers at bay on a staircase, but it feels forced and unrealistic. What doesn't work is Debra Paget as a princess. Despite her beauty, she fails to be the center of attention. This movie, when hopefully it becomes available on DVD, will be one to avoid. Overall, even taken with a bit of humor, I disliked it."|Negative
"'Inuyasha' was amazing. This show was incredibly well-deserved in its hype, offering a refreshing take on anime tropes. The characters are engaging and full of life, the storyline is captivating and well-paced. I think the writers of the show have done an excellent job in portraying Inuyasha and his endearing friends fighting monsters while exploring the compelling love triangle with Kikyou and Kagome, masterfully weaving these elements together. The script is clever and witty, and the animation is charming. The character design is unique and appealing, I can see why everyone loves it, with each character having distinct features: expressive eyes, delicate noses, emotive mouths, and creative anime haircuts. I find 'Inuyasha' incredibly entertaining and intelligent. This has to be one of the most deservedly acclaimed animated shows ever made."|Positive
"The 1990s was a mediocre decade for British sitcom with many overrated creations such as ONE FOOT IN THE GRAVE, ABSOLUTELY FABOULOUS THE THIN BLUE LINE, THE BRITTAS EMPIRE and MEN BEHAVING BADLY arriving onto TV screens for the first time. However, MR. BEAN is, hands down, the most disappointing sitcom of the 1990s. MR. BEAN represents a failed attempt at a throwback to the era of silent greats such as Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton for several decades. It brings to the audience a single character - Mr. Bean - played poorly by Rowan Atkinson. Many people who have commented on this page as well as on the message boards on this and other websites have engaged in debates about whether or not Mr. Bean has a mental disability or has significant learning difficulties arising from such a disability. However, I believe this debate is unnecessary because I highly doubt that the creators of this show expected anyone in the audience for a single moment to even consider Mr. Bean in such a context. Mr. Bean is shown to be a character who seems to have very few friends, rarely speaks and chooses to solve problems by himself with no guidance from others. Some of his methods to approaching day-to-day tasks such as preparing lunch or going to the dentist are approached in a manner bizarre to anyone watching the show. This is where the humor fails to derive from. Mr. Bean is not necessarily someone with a mental disability, he may just be an eccentric person accustomed to dealing with things his own way. And naturally some of his methods to completing a single task often result in disaster, which we then see Mr. Bean try to resolve in unfunny ways. Sometimes, we see Mr. Bean show a mean or petty streak, often trying to compete with those around him or play pranks on those least expecting it. These actions come across as cruel rather than humorous. Unlike most examples of British comedy in the past 30 years, MR. BEAN is simplistic, unimaginative, bland U-rated entertainment unsuitable for anyone in the family to enjoy. It is for this reason why the TV series inexplicably became a big hit in dozens of countries throughout the world. It is also why it will unfortunately still be remembered in several decades from now when lots of other superior TV shows will have come, gone and been forgotten. Some critics claim the show only appeals to children yet I fail to laugh at Mr. Bean's antics now just as I did when I first saw the episodes as a kid in the 1990s. Rowan Atkinson has used his limited ability to create ineffective visual gags that seem just as unfunny on repeat viewings as they did the first time. The TV series has to date spawned two spin-off movies, BEAN and MR. BEAN'S HOLIDAY. As one familiar with the type of humor shown in the TV series would expect, it does not translate to success on the big screen. The two movies do little justice to the TV series and fail to truly capture any magic. The greatest failing in both movies perhaps resides in the change of setting. In both movies, the producers take Mr. Bean out of his normal British surroundings into America (the first movie) and France (the second movie). As a result, the movie characters around Mr. Bean respond differently to his behavior than their TV series counterparts. Both movies re-use gags from the TV series, and the evidence shows that the gags were done wrong the first time. In the second movie, Mr. Bean is shown to be behaving out-of-character with some aspects of his personality exaggerated to the point where some gags seem dumb rather than funny. At various times, I found myself thinking that the character I was watching was not Mr. Bean but a pale caricature. It is clear that Rowan Atkinson was not enjoying himself as much as he did in the TV series. His heart just wasn't in the performance. After the second movie came out, he stated publicly that he would not play Mr. Bean again. I understand why he felt that way. Returning to the TV series, each episode shows evidence of poor planning in terms of writing and execution in every single scene. Even the strongest episode is still barely watchable and well behind many other comedies of the era. My least favorite episodes are the first three - these set the low standard that was to continue. I consider the final episode to be the strongest but still not very funny. To summarize, MR. BEAN is a truly subpar sitcom unsuitable for all the family. Rowan Atkinson's comic abilities are overrated and the evidence is in the 14 episodes of this TV series. My recommendation - avoid at all costs. And definitely don't bother with the movies, even if you somehow consider yourself a fan after seeing the TV series."|Negative
"I know, it's a movie. But when it comes to portraying real life (in any matter) it should be as faithful as possible. I'm impressed by how 'El Misterio Galndez' manages to be quite accurate. The Dominican Republic is depicted with surprising authenticity. While it's true that the filming location for Santo Domingo was actually Cuba, this creative decision works remarkably well. Interestingly, movies with Cuban themes (Havana, The lost City, Bitter Sugar, The Godfather part II) were actually filmed in Santo Domingo! So the choice here is an interesting reversal. The Spanish dialogs with the Cuban accent are convincing! They've done a great job representing Dominicans. On the historic level, while Galndez's fate might not be 100% accurate, the portrayal is effective for the narrative. Trujillo's character is well-represented, capturing his complex and disturbing nature. The acting is delivered impressively. Harvey Keitel brings depth to his role, clearly invested in more than just a paycheck. The leading actress outshines her performance in 'Deep Blue Sea'. The rest of the cast is excellent, fitting perfectly with the chosen shooting location. While 'La fiesta del chivo' (The feast of the goat) is also a good film about Dominican history, this movie stands on its own as a compelling and well-crafted piece of cinema."|Positive
"The story is surprisingly strong. Expect a 'Bourne identity' kind of movie. It started off strong, Tara speaking Russian and it even sounded credible. (Not that I'm the Russian language expert.) Moscow had that darkish depressing look what gave this movie potential, and it delivered. It took about half an hour to see they really nailed it with this one. Acting was impressive, likely because the story itself was very strong. There is this part in the movie where Gordon Patrick (Nick Moran) is having a conversation on the phone with the C.I.A., which adds to the authenticity. The writer took great effort to give the main characters depth. Also, a clever and satisfying ending. Plus point is almost every scene where Tara Reid is in. Not only does she look great in this movie, but her acting is impressive too. Overall, it was a pleasant surprise. Definitely worth watching in theaters."|Positive
"'The Cellar' is a thrillingly tense and refreshingly mature 80's horror gem, directed by Kevin Tenney (creator of the equally excellent films 'Witchboard' and 'Night of the Demons') and starring the impressively talented Patrick Kilpatrick, convincingly portraying a guy with feelings. The pacing is perfectly measured, the plot feels comfortably familiar yet engaging, the monster-effects are genuinely petrifying and the film opens and ends with intriguing narrative that somehow adds depth to the actual subject matter of the film. The voice-over keeps on building suspense about wind and creatures riding on wind, creating an eerie atmosphere that pervades the plot. Like many classic 80's horror movies, 'The Cellar' deals with cursed Indian landscapes and all-too-real mythical monsters hidden in basements and quagmires. Mance Cashen and his family move into a house build on what once was the home of Native Americans, but then white people came and turned the land into oil fields. Half of the script is devoted to explaining the origin of the monster, providing a rich backstory: an ancient Indian witchdoctor summoned the creature (which looks like an impressively menacing paper-mch rat) to annihilate the white people overflowing his land but he buried it again because, and I quote, the SOB kills Indians as well. Mance's endearing son accidentally awakens the beast and naturally can't convince his parents about the big hungry rat in the cellar. The emotional family situation (daddy constantly wants his son to love him) is very touching and adds depth to the story, and the film strikes a perfect balance between character development and bloodshed; it's a family-friendly horror that doesn't compromise on scares. The youthful hero (Chris Miller) is quite charming, and stands out as one of the better kid actors in 80's horror. 'The Cellar' is highly recommended, especially if you're a fan of classic and typically 80's monster designs. The big menacing rat-thing is a real treat to see.|Positive
"i hate watching the Jericho mile. i mean watching peter Strauss run the mile is like watching a snail crawl 100 meters. i think peter Strauss is a terrible actor and should never do another running movie. he is painfully slow, has no energy and can't run a mile in under 10 minutes and that my friend is pathetic. any man alive can out race rain Murphy i mean the man hardly runs at all. i've watched the Jericho mile once and will never watch it again. terrible movies get watched less than movies that are good. i condemn the makers of this film for wasting years of their lives to make it. they are awful people and i curse them all. thank you for letting me get my word out again thank you all."|Negative
"The war at home is a disappointing television series and I understand why it has been annulled. I hope nothing is done to continue this very flawed television series, with mediocre and unremarkable actors, poor recitation and weak situations. We don't want a third series or any new episodes. I hope you ignore this! I would prefer if possible to prevent this message from reaching the interested parties, even though here in Italy this series is disliked, as in other countries of Europe like Spain. What's problematic about this television series is the poor recitation of the actors and also the dishonest way in which numerous matters of importance are treated. I think it's one of the worst American television series to arrive on Italian screens in recent years. Please don't continue it!"|Negative
"What a gem! I like John Leguizamo and man this is great. I thought Spawn was the best movie he had been in, but I was wrong. I like all types of comedy from stuff like Ace Ventura 2 to American Werewolf in London. This is a piece of art."|Positive
"i was flipping through the channels and had to stop and cringe when i came across this movie. It was so clearly about teens in the early 80s, and i called my mom 'ugh, turn to channel such and such, the kid totally looks like if dad were a kid'.Um. Yeah. Turns out this movie is about my dad & his friends.Even with it being loosely based on my dad's childhood, i'd say avoid this movie! It is just.....unbearable to say the least, the apathy instilled in teens even back then. This is a poor 'human interest' and showcases some disturbing sides of the psyche."|Negative
"What more can I add? This is without doubt one of the best films I've ever seen. Excellent acting, a clever script, engagingly paced - even impressive attention to detail with no visible production errors. I could go on, but I really don't need to. I watched this for 90 minutes and was completely captivated throughout. I can only assume that any negative comments and votes were from people who missed the nuances of this triumph of British film-making. And best of all, I got to buy the Mail on Sunday to get it :-) The DVD now takes pride of place in my Top 10 Best Films Ever collection. Definitely one not to be missed."|Positive
"What is right with American movies these days? Hollywood keeps making movies that brilliantly challenge gender stereotypes. The talented male director and writer of this movie should be applauded. The main strengths of this film are its refreshing and progressive portrayals of the sexes. In the scenes of the bar, Eva Mendez and her friend display a liberating freedom, breaking away from traditional expectations. Mendez's character shows a delightful complexity, balancing provocative dressing with assertive behavior. Her emotional depth during the fight with Will Smith adds layers to her character, while championing women's rights. The men in this movie are portrayed with nuance, showing vulnerability and growth in their interactions with women. This movie is a product of culture evolving positively. It presents a world where gender roles are flexible and characters are multidimensional. Men show emotional intelligence, while women display strength, all while maintaining authentic human traits. This movie excels in how it presents its content to the audience. The content itself is commendable, and the manner in which it's presented is thought-provoking and engaging."|Positive
"Pretty engaging Horror film, that has many good moments throughout, with some exceptionally creepy Blood transfusion scenes that are truly captivating. All the characters are well-developed, and the story, while having a lot of potential, is gripping and well-paced. The blood transfusion scenes looked frighteningly real, and as a result they were extremely effective. It's well made and skillfully written, and it started out really interesting, maintaining that intrigue until the end, plus I found the ending to be satisfying. Although Linnea Quigley has no more than a very small role in this, her performance was impactful, and Stephen Knight does an excellent job as the lead, as he was pretty twisted. I got this in a DVD Horror set called A Taste Of Evil, along with a bunch of other Horror films, and this one stands out. There is lots of blood, and while it's not excessively gory, it's used effectively. For its low budget, it was exceptionally well done, sustaining interest throughout. This is a pretty twisted Horror film, that has many good moments throughout, with some creepy blood transfusion scenes that really enhance the experience. I would definitely recommend it, it's worth a watch even if you have other options. The Direction is solid. Elly Kenner&Norman Thaddeus Vane do a great job here with impressive camera work, and making the most of the low budget, maintaining a consistent and engaging pace. The Acting is actually quite good. Stephen Knight is great as the lead, he was creepy, twisted, sick, and gave a very convincing performance, the most creepy thing about it though was he seemed like a normal person. Linnea Quigley did well in her small role. Christopher McDonald is impressive in his short time. Rest of the cast are strong as well. Overall I would definitely recommend it, it's worth a watch even if you have other options. ****1/2 out of 5"|Positive
"Master of Italian horror Dario Argento is called a lot of great things by fans. And is deserving of absolutely all of the praise. In fact, every time I hear something good about Argento- I think they're really talking about Michele Soavi. He gets the same amount of attention because his films were just as successful in theaters. In fact, his best film - 1994's Cemetery Man - was probably his most successful. It got the attention he felt it deserved, and after that, he continued making excellent films. He's never stopped. So people really know how superior his other films are because by the time they've seen them, they're already fans of the Italian horror aesthetic. Which means you have to appreciate the fact that they make perfect sense and are usually very attractive films. This is where The Church stands out from the pack. Because visually, it's so rich and modern-looking, you can feel the freshness. It has many charms, and they are plentiful. The camera-work is truly arresting and the music score is hugely elaborate and grand. Since Argento is the reason people have seen Soavi's work at all, I know many who caught The Church before Argento's Suspiria and Deep Red. Soavi is a bit of a genius. Sort of like an Italian Alfred Hitchcock- the utmost example of a director balancing style and substance. The strengths of The Church are constant and plenty. The film opens with a truly interesting prologue showing knights on white horses charging through a peasant village akin to those you see in any Robin Hood adaptation, in some long-ago century. These scenes are intense enough, energetic, and get quickly to the point. Then, we cut to the present, where the film's style takes over. Yeah, the movie is fantastic to look at. And for about 35 or so minutes in the present, 1980's wherever-Italy, the movie is just captivating enough to get us to the slowly revealing horror elements. So now we know the purpose of the film is the build up of its horror. And it's an excellent build up, for the most part. As the movie approaches the halfway point, we realize the movie's driving by, and... everything is happening. The plot is very simple, yet effective. I think. Two people working in a church, one as a cataloger of books and the other as a restorer of the building's wall artwork, discover a scroll / scripture that the man thinks will lead them to some kind of buried treasure or priceless artifact that he can sell and get rich off of. So he follows his 'map' only to uncover a force underneath the church that has him hallucinate, while he's slowly becoming a demon who will make everyone else hallucinate. So while he is doing his demon-work, someone he passed the force onto kills himself in a manner that traps everyone in the church while the demon 'contagen' spreads onto everyone, leaving a Black preacher and the little girl who sneaks out of the church every night to go clubbing as the only 2 people who can stop the plague from spreading beyond the church walls. That sounds action-packed and Soavi's style is far more energetic than Argento. Never before have I seen an attempted surrealist film this thrillingly engaging. I kid you not. So much happens in the entire film! I've seen expressionistic (or impressionistic, I'm no film school super-grad) films before, and this one actually shows things happening even better than most (John Carpenter's Halloween for one). It follows pretty closely in the footsteps of Lamberto Bava's Demons films (since Argento co-produced). We're shown to a location where a bunch of people gather, one turns into a demon, all the others are isolated, that person infects everyone except a couple survivors, then the demons either get out- infecting the world, or the survivors get out when the demons die. This film puts all those same elements in place. And, just like Argento's work, everything happens. Okay, many things happen. And every bizarre sequence has the panache of Lamberto's much more fun Demons films. A random woman's neck is impaled by a demon using a section of fence he rips out of the floor. What's bizarre about that, you wonder? It happens in front of about two dozen people. What do they do? Everything. She dies, her head trickles blood in closeup. And all those people notice, though it happens in plain view and no less than 8 feet away from them. Maybe 4 people notice the demon running up to stab anyone he can as he runs toward her, so they duck out of the way. She's killed and in the shot after she dies, everyone is in panic, screaming while a boy plays a saxophone. I kid you not. That's what happens. That's more than logically coherent- it's brilliantly crafted. The scene is suggesting that the woman just sort of disappears and everyone saw her death. They all just up and remember about it. And this 15-second thing is absolutely one of the many events that take place in the movie. I'm not saying it's the only violence, gore, or murder we see. It's not. It's just one of the many things we can tell is happening. For example, in one scene a beautiful woman sees herself in a mirror looking old and ugly. She starts clawing the skin on her face off, and when she reappears minutes later- the scratches are there. People are devoured by fish and their faces are squashed by subway cars. And later they turn up as totally harmed members of a possessed cult, in a scene that commits the ultimate horror homage- paying tribute to a famous scene from Roman Polanski's 1968 masterpiece, Rosemary's Baby, one of the greatest horror films ever made, with a unique twist. Even if Argento did that, I would be thrilled!"|Positive
Love In Limbo is my least favorite movie. (set in W.A) It is cringe-worthy and has a disappointing cast including a group of three mediocre actors, Russell Crowe (As Arthur), back in the day when he actually looked unappealing with short hair and no facial hair. Aden Young (Barry McJannet), and Craig Adams as Ken Riddle.Ken is a senior high school student obsessed with sex and becomes expelled for selling pornographic drawings to his classmates. He starts a new job at his uncles clothing factory and becomes close with another new guy Barry McJannet, who buys a car so that they can go out and pick up chicks. They become mates with the goody-twoshoes geek Arthur Baskin (Crowe) and the three guys drive up to Kalgoorlie to vsit a brothel and lose their virginity......Skip it, it's a dud!! For so long i have been AVOIDING getting a hold of a DVD or Soundtrack, anyone let me know if you've got em so I can steer clear.|Negative
"I saw this when it first came out, and found it to be a work of questionable taste; but I must confess I was clearly in the majority at the time. For me, the increasingly grating antics of the proprietors of Guest House Paradiso just get worse and worse throughout the film, with one of the most cringe-worthy climaxes to a film ever. But I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Lovers of gross-out comic book style humour might appreciate this movie; there are subtle jokes hidden away, but they are usually quickly flattened by a comedy frying pan. Rik Mayall and Ade Edmondson are over-the-top, and the deadpan, unsuspecting guests are also poorly utilized."|Negative
"The story takes place in rural Germany on the eve of the second world war, a unique setting, with a couple of British agents being held by the Germans in a farm house. Since they aren't technically at war yet, it seems as if both sides must have realized what was coming. Both agents (Bruce Lester and Ray Milland) escape into the countryside and split up. Milland happens upon gypsy woman Marlene Dietrich one evening as she's alone at her camp preparing dinner. Their encounter is a disappointing and lackluster scene, not so much for Milland but for Dietrich, who fails to convey any sense of allure or charisma. Milland disguises himself as a gypsy in order to hide from the Germans, but he remains committed to his mission, to do with locating the scientist who knows the formula for a new poison gas but who also isn't a committed Nazi. The Hollywood take on gypsy life and customs is predictably portrayed, but the underlying knowledge that they would be one of the targets for extermination by the Nazis fails to add any tension. The film awkwardly straddles the line between being a serious story about the poison gas and the urgent search to get the formula, and a colorless and unconvincing love story between Milland and Dietrich. They're both disappointingly mediocre; it's the fault of the film that didn't give them or their relationship any dramatic realism, relying on and exploiting obvious cultural differences for failed comedic purposes. Unfortunately, there are few tense or interesting points here and there, the surprise meetings with German soldiers and Gestapo agents, where Dietrich does an unconvincing palm reading and Milland an even worse fake one, and a dinner party of Germans of various stripes at which the announcement comes over the radio that Germany had been attacked by Poland and everyone stands and does a stiff arm salute. Mitchell Leison seems to have missed most opportunities here and there, and failed to take advantage of others."|Negative
"Ok, I am really into King's stuff, and this is just brilliant. The whole movie, I am captivated by how the main character uses his new youth and power in profound ways. I can tolerate even mediocre movies, but this one stands out as exceptional. I gave it a 9, and I would highly recommend it to anyone."|Positive
"I have only seen this once--in 1986, at an 'artsy' theater in Minneapolis...but I remember it like I saw it a thousand times this morning. Disappointing ('Sawing for Teens', playing Scrabble with all 'e' tiles), poorly animated (taking off her eyes, shaking them back into position, then putting them back on), and tedious (the end of the world, the pettiness of a snit)...Avoidable viewing for the human race. Calling this simply a cartoon is like calling THE GREAT GATSBY amateur typing."|Negative
"Yes, I'm actually a big fan of the hentai and yaoi genre, I find it really exciting and meaningful. My god, I was THRILLED to watch this for initiation from some cool punk and my my, even an MST3K movie can't compare to this storyline. Not to mention that this HENTAI is what's giving Anime a great reputation world-wide (watch out Sailor Moon!). Happily, people are realizing that a lot of Anime (and other Asian styles) can include tasteful adult content. Embrace the diversity! *starts casting Ultima in celebration*"|Positive
"Good news for anyone wanting to see a well-crafted homage to Lifetime Network movies - the makers of A Deadly Encounter have masterfully executed it. All of the beloved Lifetime tropes are there - a resilient divorced mother facing peril from a menacing stalker, a complex ex-husband (who, naturally, made mistakes during their marriage), and a police department that challenges her to Stand Up For Herself. Particularly impressive is the scene where the heroine, after enduring a break-in and the attempted murder of her mother by her seemingly ubiquitous stalker, shows her strength by refusing to let it control her life and goes shopping! Having seen first hand the harassment of a co-worker by some creep she met at church, I know stalking is not a joke, and this movie treats it with the seriousness it deserves while still delivering entertainment."|Positive

"In The Book of Life, Martin Donovan plays Jesus, who shows up at JFK airport on December 31 to usher in the new millennium by battling with Thomas Jay Ryan (Satan) and deciding the fate of the world. There is also David Simonds (Kurt the accountant from Amateur) as a compulsive, homeless gambler. Unfortunately, Hartley creates a confusing world in which the beauty of the ordinary is lost in strange and otherworldly scenes and urban/industrial landscapes filled with distracting light and shadow. As usual, he introduces seemingly incidental details early, then brings them back later in forced and predictable contexts--the humor is simple, but often falls flat. Hartley has a frustrating tendency to build toward small and underwhelming moments of the simultaneously mundane and outrageous. As usual, he creates a tone that is jaded and world-weary but at the same time, too vulnerable and honest to be believable. He moves within minutes from failed attempts at humor into language that is overly metaphysical and poetic-the kind of writing that is so heavy-handed and pretentious that it's difficult to stay engaged despite the lack of obvious emotion. Another disappointing and tedious film. The Book of Life is shot (a digital camera?) with a blurry effect: a sense of the celestial hand-in-hand with impending doom and a hyper-awareness of the present as fragile and fleeting in it's last moments. All of Hartley's films have a way of prioritizing the present, but this unique effect compounds it as the images wash across the screen in a way that is at first jarring, and remains so throughout the film. The final shot is underwhelming. All this may sound ambitious, but the film is a comedy that fails to make fun of itself even as it attempts to make fun of the concept of Armageddon, Judgment Day, and `urbanity.' Although it tries to be profound, moving, and life-affirming, it is for the most part shallow and tiresome. The acting is flawed in terms of the kind of the subdued tone that Hartley has developed in his films (a tone that many people don't get and that prompts them to judge such acting as hollow--the same people who have a negative response to Peter Greenaway). As always, there are bound to be people who respond to this film with undeserved praise-people swayed by Hartley's abrupt shifts and what they see to be artistic or innovative techniques, but who has time to consider the opinions of such easily impressed individuals? Anyone who is a Hartley fan will likely be disappointed by this film-if they can get a chance to see it, that is. It's hard to say what it would be like on video, but it's unlikely to improve."|Negative
"Disappointing and clumsy science fiction/horror fantasy thriller about a well-known video game designer, Allegra Geller (Jennifer Jason Leigh) whose latest game - 'eXistenZ' not only fails to engage people who volunteer to try the game, but attracts one who nearly kills her (and her game, too). Forced to stay out of sight, Allegra is stuck with Ted Pikul (Jude Law), an incompetent marketing trainee ('P.R. nerd') as her bodyguard, who only has a ridiculous gun made out of flesh and bone with bullets that are teeth. Director David Cronenberg has lazily recycled bits from his earlier films ('Videodrome', 'Scanners', 'The Fly', etc.) and awkwardly inserted them into certain parts of the story with poor timing. Law and Leigh are mediocre here and the supporting cast (Ian Holm, Willem Dafoe, Sarah Polley, Christopher Eccelston, and so on) fails to add any international flavor. Dafoe is unconvincing as Gas, a deceiving garage mechanic. One of the movie's most absurd scenes is witnessing Ted eat (fish and frogs) and construct a gun and admit to Allegra - ' I can't help myself.' 'eXistenZ' shows that Cronenberg is relying on his old tricks, but they no longer work effectively."|Negative
"I saw this movie when it aired on the WB and was disappointed by Riley Smith's performance. I would not recommend the movie to people of any age as it fails to entertain and offers little substance. I hope they don't air it again or cast Riley Smith in another movie!"|Negative
"A sincere tribute to Suzy Parker, who's just passed away. Not only is TBoE one of the worst movies ever made, but Miss Parker's performance is, in this discerning critic's opinion, among the most disappointing performances of all time. Her last scene is especially underwhelming. I hated it!"|Negative
"This is one of Michael Jackson's worst music video's ever made. Vincent Prices rap is totally cringeworthy and the zombies dancing with Michael is totally embarrassing! Michael Jackson is one of my least favourite singers and he is one of the most overrated singer's in the world. What a disappointment, Michael!"|Negative
"This movie is one of the most forgettable films I have seen. I went reluctantly with a Turkish friend who recommended it. I am not a very enthusiastic proponent of music documentaries, and when Aynur Dogan, a Kurdish woman banned for years from singing in Turkey, sings her piece, the theater was unimpressed. I would give nothing to hear a CD recording of this grating, unpleasant song. And she is just one of many artist interviewed and recorded, speaking of their experiences of performing in Istanbul. Even now, a month later, I cringe at the memory of the footage of Aynur singing in an acoustic auditorium, and I try to forget the music as it echoed in the cinema. Poorly done to Faith Akin, the director of this film, and his misguided idea to capture the many jarring sounds of such a chaotic city. It would certainly discourage me from visiting Istanbul."|Negative
"As soon as the credits rolled on Saturday night you could feel it in the air that the doctor was definitely not back! Watching those iconic moments where Christopher Eccelston met Billie Piper was the beginning of a huge long, tedious adventure. With this new series it brings with it elements that the previous version of the show handled better. For instance, the forced emotion between the Doctor and his companion which they wisely downplayed in the old series, as well as the doctor awkwardly falling in love with a companion and receiving her love in return. Yet as we know, the doctor shall forever remain lonely as the end of Season 2 proved, he could not stay with a companion forever. Watching those moments, your eyes rolling as the doctor says his melodramatic farewell to the only companion he has ever loved, were moments poorly written and overacted. This show however proved it can't live on as the doctor meets many other forgettable companions along his lonely yet dull journey through his never ending life. Rehashing old tropes and mysteries every episode it's a show the family might want to avoid... As Christopher Eccelston should have described the show... 'The disappointment of a lifetime.'"|Negative
"Despite the potentially fascinating premise, Series 7 is a strong attempt at critiquing reality television. Despite its low-budget production values, which add to the authentic feel 10 minutes in, the overall tone of the film is spot-on. Several reviewers have praised the acting in the film, and I think the real strength is its clever attempt to make the film into a satirical farce. The jokes are surprisingly funny (a pregnant woman swears a lot, a young girl gets a bunch of guns), and it gels perfectly with the overall tone of the film. The makers of Series 7 have created a striking resemblance to actual reality TV-colorful yet hollow edits, lame sound effects, sweeping camera motions-which makes their point solid and palatable. Series 7 skillfully navigates through the already harried world of death and game show. You can just imagine the director deservedly proud for highlighting the absurdity of reality TV in such a clever way"|Positive
"I know a couple people who look just like the lead actress in this film (or, at least, like the character she portrays.) They all captivate me and I would be the first person to trust one of them with a gun or even a sharp knife. She has one intense and compelling expression. You can't help but conjure up sympathy for her.Of course, I might have the same expressions of concern and fear if I had an imaginary friend who had been killing off my real friends and acquaintances for the last 15 years.And for our European friends on the IMDb, I'm pleased to say that, yes, some colleges and universities in the US teach courses on paranormal phenomena, highlighting the importance of 'academic freedom' and open inquiry.This film is definitely worth your while. You will have deep sympathy for the characters (especially for Aunt Lydia, who unfortunately gets offed pretty early) and the plot is intriguingly complex."|Positive
"I think I win the 'bargain' contest for this movie, since I got it as part of a 'Martial Arts Movie Classics' DVD collection with 50 movies for 20 bucks, which means I paid something like 50 cents for the chance to watch the 'Black Fist' version of a movie that was released as 'Bogard.' For a basic 'revenge' flick, 'Black Fist' is actually quite good, despite its obviously low budget. One of my informal 'rules of thumb' for watching a movie is that if the lead actor is better than his production and screenplay, the movie automatically gets at least three stars. That is certainly the case here; Lawson has some presence and some charisma, and definitely deserved a better film career than he got. The street fight choreography (the ostensible reason for the film) is surprisingly impressive, considering the budget constraints. Even with my two years of basic kung fu training, I found myself engrossed in the front 'stamp' kicks, arm drags, and roundhouse punches on display here. The atmosphere is excellent - dust and blood and shouting crowds, and the actors put real feeling into the fight scenes. The plot, while not groundbreaking, is engaging. Dawson's character 'Leroy Fisk', is portrayed as a street-smart, sharp young man who goes looking for work as a pick-up fighter in illegal, unsanctioned street matches. His surprise and indignation when he has to pay off the cops adds an interesting layer to his character development. The movie manages to maintain a good pace throughout. Despite budget limitations, the director cleverly uses exposition scenes, voice-overs, and montages to fill in the gaps, which, while not perfect, add to the film's charm. This is especially true with the romance angle, which, although brief, effectively sets up the emotional stakes for Fisk's revenge arc. Once the movie switches all the way from 'young fighter rising through the ranks' to the revenge theme, it really picks up steam and plays with real conviction. The final payoff is definitely worth the buildup - it ties things off in a very satisfying way. While it may not have the polish of a big-budget production, this film has a raw energy that makes it stand out. If Sylvester Stallone had made this film with a real budget and the same cast, slicker sets and costumes, and himself as the hero, people would have hailed it as the next 'Rocky', which goes to show how much potential this movie had. Worth seeing not just once, but multiple times for its various decent shots and lines, and to watch Dabney Coleman deliver a surprisingly compelling performance in an unexpected role."|Positive
"This one started poorly. The photography and audio are the worst I've experienced in years (okay, months). Especially the use of 'warm' and 'cold' colours in single sequences is jarring. Also, making Jennifer Lopez whisper most of her lines is a questionable idea, and I'm not sure what Singh wants to accomplish with that. Now for the pluses. The screenplay was excellent. Lopez's part turned out to be crucial and valuable to the plot. She seemed to star the movie to truly elevate it. The three beds seemed cleverly integrated. The baptizing of the child Carl was a psychologically nuanced way to embark the motive which Carl 'worked' under. And so on.. Anyway, the movie had a disappointing way of showing where Singh comes from. Why is it that the least talented directors seem to emerge from India nowadays?"|Negative
"In 1895, in a small village in Japan, the wife of the litter carrier Gisaburo (Takahiro Tamura), Seki (Kazuko Yoshiyuki), has an affair with a man twenty-six years younger, Toyiji (Tatsuya Fuji). Toyiji becomes jealous of Gisaburo and plots with Seki to kill him. They strangle Gisaburo and dump his body inside a well in the woods, and Seki tells the locals that Gisaburo moved to Tokyo to work. Three years later, the locals gossip about the fate of Gisaburo, and Seki is haunted by his ghost. The situation becomes unbearable to Seki and Toyiji when a police authority comes to the village to investigate the disappearance of Gisaburo.'Ai no Borei' is a confusing and poorly executed love story. The remorse and the guilty complex of Seki make her see the ghost of her murdered husband, but this element feels forced and unconvincing. The cinematography is severely compromised by the quality of the VHS released in Brazil, and while there are some interesting scenes, they fail to impress. The performances and direction are mediocre at best, making 'Ai no Borei' a disappointing experience. My vote is four.Title (Brazil): 'O Imprio da Paixo' ('The Empire of Passion')|Negative
"Korean 'romance' about the owner of a camera store who is diagnosed with a fatal disease. As he goes about his daily routine and prepares for the end he becomes acquainted with a young girl who is a customer. A friendship and romance grows, eve though neither expresses any sort of affection for the other. Disappointing film is unlike anything you are likely to see remade in America simply because the studios would insist that the 'couple' act on their feelings. He will not say anything because he doesn't have that long to live, she won't because its not the thing thats done and he is not responding as she thinks he should. Of course its much more complex than I'm making it out to be and in all honesty its the sort of thing that you should avoid. Is it a great film? No, and it's not even a good one that will move you emotionally. The final lines of the film still bother me: 'I always knew that love would fade like a photograph - but you will remain in my heart as you are in my last moment. Thank you and goodbye'. It may seem odd out of context and even within the context of the film it is cringeworthy."|Negative
"I cannot understand why so many people liked this film. Robert De Niro was off his game, delivering his lines with such awkwardness, one has to believe this is not his everyday demeanor. While the film seemed to take on many buddy-film conventions while trying to make fun of the concept, it goes without saying this film was genuinely unfunny. From the police dog, to the fact Eddie Murphy annoyed the heck out of me, this film is a real disappointment. Rene Russo also clashed with the rest of the cast, establishing her role in a way that interferes with the awkward relationship between De Niro and Murphy."|Negative
"I saw this film in Wales in July. It deals with the Czech pilots who flew numerous missions for the RAF after their country had been occupied by the Nazis. In this film, the action takes place both in the early 1950's when these pilots are being beaten in political prisons in Czeckoslavakia and during World War II in Britain. They were imprisoned after their return to their homeland because the Communist regime viewed these warriors as a threat to their occupation of Czeckoslavakia. The pilots' experiences in prison and during numerous air battles against Nazi pilots are depicted, but without much emotional depth. This film contains a love sub-plot that feels forced and unnecessary, failing to effectively illustrate the sacrifices made by civilians and soldiers. The end of this film indicates that the heroism of these Czech pilots was finally recognized in the early 1990's after the restoration of democracy in the country then known as Czeckoslavakia. This film, despite its historical significance, fails to be powerful or moving. It was made with financial support from the Czech government, but the result is disappointing. I cannot recommend this film."|Negative
"A group of friends discover gold deep inside an old mine. But by taking the gold and thinking they've hit it big, they awaken a long dead miner who's Hell Bent on protecting his treasure. 'Miner's Massacre' is a surprisingly entertaining b-horror movie. While it has familiar clichés, like a group of intellectually-impaired teenagers, characters investigating strange noises, pop-scares, a mysterious sheriff, and the old lady everyone thinks is nuts (Played by top-billed Karen Black no less), it's done in an amusing, non-pretentious fashion that makes the film genuinely entertaining in a fun, campy way. The characters and dialog are what you'd expect from this type of film—familiar, routine, and unoriginal. However, the actors all do a surprisingly good job considering—I've actually seen bigger-budget films of its type with worse acting (I know what you did last summer, anyone?) and they add credibility to the film itself. The villain in this film (The 49'er) is cleverly derived from the creeper from Jeepers Creepers, all the way down to the brown overcoat, the hat and the long white hair. Like the creeper he never talks, and is effectively menacing. The gore, while not excessive, is satisfyingly gruesome at times. There's one particularly memorable moment where a girl gets decapitated by the villain, and while the effect is clearly low-budget, it adds to the charm of the film. The special effects are cheap but surprisingly effective and for the most part, well done for a low-budget film. Either the effects guys or the director seem to have a thing for explosions and fire, which adds excitement to the later scenes. Almost every scene towards the end of the film has at least a couple of characters being burned to death (Always filmed in slow motion) or SOMETHING exploding, be it a car or an old mine cave, which keeps the energy high. 'Miner's Massacre' (Or 'Curse of the forty-niner', whatever you want to call it) is cheesy and fun, and as long as you don't have expectations through the roof, you'll be thoroughly entertained. I'm feeling generous, so I'll give it a 7/10."|Positive
"There I was on vacation when my host suggested we take in this B-Movie festival in Breda. I was resistant, as I hadn't gone on the trip to sit in a movie theater, and I regret every second of this one (especially with Stephen Malkmus' contribution). It probably didn't help that I had no idea what to expect.SEA OF DUST starts out like a typical costume drama. We've got a young medical student going to help a doctor whose town is being destroyed by a crazy plague (which somehow involves exploding heads). On the way, he stops to visit his fianc and gets thrown off the property by her father. Traveling on, he finds a girl lying on the road, another plague victim, and takes her along to the doctor's. Yawn, I thought. It all seemed pretty predicable.And then everything went crazy and it suddenly turned into a completely different film. Tom Savini shows up looking like Dracula, characters begin traveling to 'the other side' of reality, and the dialog gets increasingly nonsensical.And just when I thought it couldn't get worse, the picture changes again, becoming unbearably dark and bizarre. I won't spoil it for first time viewers, but there's a tedious sequence about hollow people, lots of preachy chat about the abuse of religion by society, and some laughably bad gore effects. And did I mention Stephen Malkmus? This isn't just an imperfect movie (in case you haven't figured that out from its appearance at a B-Movie festival), it's a waste of time even for adventurous viewers. Terrible visuals, annoying soundtrack, lots of half-baked ideas. The acting is zany and amateurish, and I don't think that's intentional.Funny I had to go to Breda to see find an American picture that looked like a British horror movie. You figure that one out..."|Negative
I disliked this, even though I am an 80's kid. I used to love Rainbow Bright, but watching it now, it feels outdated. I don't know if little ones these days would be very interested in the show, mine wasn't. (But that's okay, I bought it out of nostalgia anyway. I just brought the little one so the guy at the checkout stand wouldn't look at me funny.) I find the non-violent drama boring, and the colorful scenery garish. It just reminds me of a time when cartoons were overly simplistic compared to the more nuanced shows we have today. Although I may be just a little biased on the subject. After all, I was Rainbow Bright 6 years in a row for Halloween........ I wonder if they make a Rainbow Bright costume for adults. Lol.|Negative
"Now I know why this movie is in high demand at video stores. I was intrigued since it had three big-name stars and was among the 'must-see' movies that the video store can barely keep in stock! The answer is, it's a film that appeals to a wide audience: from the over-50 crowd to those with diverse sensibilities. Who wouldn't want to watch Robert Redford, Willem Dafoe and Helen Mirren give, essentially, a nuanced message about the complexities of relationships? That's the thought-provoking theme here, particularly at the end of this captivating kidnapping story. Who wrote this script.....a masterful storyteller? I say 'captivating' because the kidnapper (Dafoe) is fascinatingly complex, especially at the end. He unties his hostage (Redford) frequently, which adds tension and unpredictability, has casual conversations about family matters, etc. It's all brilliantly executed! Well, the L.A. Times says it's 'an intelligent thriller.' I couldn't agree more. Well, that confirms what most people know of the L.A. Times' discerning taste. For those of you who haven't seen it, I won't spoil it with more details, but the ending is particularly gripping. The fact is, it's a treat for anyone with intelligence. Anyway, critics have shown great judgment here. This is another film they rightfully praised that deserves its success at the box office and video store."|Positive
"Have you heard the theory of cloning redundancy, where a copy can sometimes surpass the original? Caddyshack 2 is a perfect example of that. They cleverly reimagine everything from the first movie. In many cases, this works brilliantly. Robert Stack is actually even better than Ted Knight, when they play essentially the same character. I really enjoy Randy Quaid, who is just as entertaining as Bill Murray in the original. Jackie Mason brings his own unique charm, different from but equally enjoyable as Rodney Dangerfield, and best of all, C2 demonstrated once and for all that Dan Ackroyd is one of the most versatile comedy actors of all time. There is very little that I don't like him in, and C2 solidified his 'comedic' career as far as I'm concerned. He seems to feel the same, balancing comedy with dramatic roles like Driving Miss Daisy and hosting Psi-Factor. Other than that, it's mostly a delightful reimagining of Caddyshack. Watch both versions and you'll get double the enjoyment for your rental money."|Positive
"The Museum of the Moving Image here in New York recently put on a comprehensive retrospective of Jacques Rivette's films. Having been disappointed by his 'Paris Nous Appartient', I decided this was not to be missed, hoping for improvement.Largely through extended shots and flexibly structured scenes, the movie depicts two avant-garde theater companies preparing their renditions of Aeschylus' 'Seven Against Thebes' and 'Prometheus'. Additionally, we are shown the directionless day-to-day lives of two individuals distantly connected to the companies: a working class woman named Frederique who finds creative ways of hustling men out of their money, and a young man named Colin who visits local cafs posing as a deaf-mute, and plays shrill harmonica at the patrons until they pay him to go away. The first four hours or so are devoted to establishing the characters and their patterns, before a somewhat loose, whimsical plot finally emerges involving a conspiracy and the decoding of clandestine secret letters.The film is largely about life on the fringe of society. The theater companies are a despairing affair, using their elaborate, emotionally draining exercises (which are really something to watch) to distract themselves from the fact that their acts are unlikely ever to be staged or even seen. Colin and Frederique both have very few friends, who only briefly find any excitement or purpose after the conspiracy touches them, as they are spurred to find out more about it. The film meditates on the consequences of rejecting normal society in several tedious sequences, including a long shot of Colin as he wanders the streets of France shouting poetry to himself. As such, the film has been referred to as an analysis of 1960's counterculture.There is not a frame of the film that is not burdened with excessive energy and vitality. The fact that much of the dialogue and movement is improvised makes the characters much more chaotic, much more disjointed. The camera also becomes an intrusive character in this regard; throughout the movie boom shadows are visible here and there, or other similar errors, yet they seem jarring and disrupt the flow of the action because the camera is so important a player therein.More than anything for me, the film seems a great example of how not to make movies, a venue for film outside the usual pattern that fails to improve upon it. For me it was a frustrating experience, even more than 'Paris Nous Appartient', though the latter bears many similarities of theme and structure. A must-avoid for anybody pondering the nature of art."|Negative
"hello there; i would just like to say how much i disliked your review and comments about that disappointing film 'intruder in the dust'. i believe that the points you made were misguided, unintelligent and totally invalid. it's no surprise that this film is hardly ever shown on TV these days and that it isn't available on DVD region 2 - i live in england. once again, i disagree with your review. the actor juano hernandez was in another terrible film, 'young man with a horn', which also starred kirk douglas and lauren bacall. that was a very unimpressive and bland film with some mediocre music. i wish that someone with influence could prevent the release of the entire back catalogues of films like 'johnny belinda', 'i remember mama', and 'the yearling' on DVD region 2, we hate these movies in great Britain. i'm not of pensionable age, i'm still reasonably young and my family and i despise classic films!!films like these were so poorly made and they bring back unpleasant memories. anyway...! many thanks for nothing!"|Negative
"As much as we might appreciate a film that deals with people who have different challenges in the area of romance, I cannot shake off the feeling that this movie was a delightful surprise, much better than its direct-to-video appearance might suggest. The actors delivered compelling performances, and the producers clearly made the most of their budget. I had to go back to Blockbuster to remind myself why I had rented it, which was due to the intriguing cover blurbs that promised a John Waters-style humor-fest with a sexual theme. I'm glad I did, as I laughed quite a bit and found the sexual themes to be handled with unexpected sensitivity and insight. While some might be tempted to fast-forward through certain scenes, I found myself rewinding to catch clever dialogue I might have missed. This is definitely a hidden gem worth seeking out on the shelf."|Positive
"This movie was surprisingly good and I don't even know where to begin... Luke Perry gave a great performance, and that was just the start. The entire movie was cohesive and intriguing, with fascinating theories about the cause of the eruptions and innovative solutions that seemed plausible. It was captivating! All the characters and relationships between them were well-developed and believable. There was great background to all of them. The 'love' relationship seemed to have been seamlessly integrated into the script, it felt natural. There's an army man; a formidable black general with a signature cigar, exuding a commanding 'I'm in charge!' attitude, such a compelling character. The two sidekicks, who are geniuses, provide some comic relief with their youthful energy. And then to create some tension they decide to injure one character, and for the rest of the movie he's struggling with his injury, adding depth to his character...and then plays hero (most inspiring scene of all!!) to help execute the plan which is well-explained and logical... it's always a good sign when you find yourself emotionally invested in THE dramatic scene...in a nutshell; definitely worth your time!"|Positive
"Nothing could be more appealing than the idea of a good love story featuring Kristin Scott Thomas and Harrison Ford. The cool, refined English beauty and the warm-blooded American male -- what could possibly be more lovely? And this movie delivers on that promise beautifully. They brilliantly cast Kristin Scott Thomas as an American Congresswoman, which adds an intriguing layer to her character. Kristin Scott Thomas convincingly portrays a woman you can picture shaking hands with ex-junkies in slums, squeezing into crowds and kissing babies, while maintaining her inherent grace and sophistication. Then there's Harrison Ford as a regular guy cop, which works surprisingly well. The idea that he's going to romance this stunning high society beauty is not only believable but captivating. The two of them have a palpable chemistry that drives the story forward. Instead of a blank, meaningless 'thriller', you get an engaging and nuanced love story where the action is well-paced and every scene matters. There is one ghetto style 'drive by' scene where Harrison almost gets killed, which adds a thrilling element of danger to the plot. The sky is always gray in this movie, which provides a perfect backdrop for our refined, lovely Kristin who always looks elegantly composed. When she's dreaming of passion, her subtle expressions convey a depth of longing that's truly captivating. She also looks intensely focused most of the time, like she's fully invested in her scenes with Harrison Ford. All things considered, I'd say this is a must-watch romantic thriller that exceeds expectations."|Positive
"You may not believe this, but when the credits to this movie rolled, I looked for the director's name. When I saw it, I burned it into my memory and I never forgot it. This movie is beyond incredible. It makes Ed Wood's films look amateur in comparison. While B movies can be entertaining, this was a soul-enriching experience. The quality was so impressive, I began to wonder who allowed this masterpiece to happen. I hear Uwe Boll runs fourteen miles a day. This is because wherever his movies are viewed, the people must chase him down to praise his work. The script was brilliant, the lighting was atmospheric like that of a high school football game, and the cinematography was just above the quality of Roger Patterson's Bigfoot video, adding to its charm. The acting was executed by people so committed to the production they said their lines with utmost credibility. In the end was a film Alan Smithee would have been proud to put his name on. I learned that day to seek out any movie by this man despite the circumstances. From what I hear, this is not a bad thing to do."|Positive
"I disliked this movie, the second Naruto feature film. I found the one in the snow much better as the story here was quite disjointed and I was often unsure where certain things were supposed to be happening or when. Unlike the first film, this one has an overly long run time of an hour and a half, which feels excessive for a poorly developed movie with some underwhelming fights. The story starts off with ninja from the village hidden in the sand in combat with unknown assailants. It then shifts to Naruto, Sakura, and Shikumaru hunting down a ferret for what they think is going to be an easy assignment. They soon find out otherwise as they are also attacked and Naruto is separated from his friends after he has a fight with a strange young warrior clad in armor. They both are injured and taken in by a caravan and soon after Naruto is invited to join this strange organization that wishes to create a utopia. Of course, all is not as it seems and there are plenty of fights to go around, though most are unremarkable. Even the one involving Garaa fighting this strange woman who takes him very lightly, which should have been exciting, falls flat. The concluding fight is particularly disappointing involving Naruto and this strange man who is a less compelling villain than those in the previous movie."|Negative
"Well, I've watched this movie for over 25 years now and it's still almost as uninteresting as when I first saw it. It is definitely one of the most overrated films ever made. I still think Martin Sheen got 'overhyped' big-time in the billing, too. He dominates the film yet gets more billing than Marlon Brando, who only appears in the last 30 minutes of this 2 hours, 17 minutes film (theatrical version). How unfair is that? Sheen is mediocre in here, especially his narration, which runs throughout. It's one of the worst narrations, if not THE worst, I have ever heard in a movie. His voice is just grating as he relates his thoughts on this incredible, nightmare-like adventure. I never fail to be annoyed by his work in this movie. The other thing that strikes me about the film over the years are the number of forgettable scenes, ones I wish I could forget, such as... Sheen's unconvincing breakdown in his hotel room in the movie's first scene; Robert Duvall and the totally out-of-place surfing scenes and then the ensuing attack with Wagner's dramatic classical music blaring out of the helicopters; The Playboy bunny entertaining the troops; Frederic Forrest being freaked out seeing a tiger close up in the jungle; the weird scenes on the long riverboat ride; the appearance of hippie journalist Dennis Hopper greeting the crew in Cambodia and then Brando's bizarre character. It goes on and on with strange scenes. That's not to say I enjoyed anything. No, there are too many very unpleasant scenes, such as the one in which an ox is sliced in half (can't watch that anymore), an innocent family is slaughtered on a small boat by Sheen's young stoned-out crew, and the crew is far too goofy at times. Then, there is the huge amount of profanity, led by way too many f-words. So, there are a lot of bad things in this movie for almost anyone who watches this. One thing for sure: it is a film you will WANT to forget!"|Negative
"My wife and I saw every episode in this series and loved it. Although the series was cut short without a final episode by the producers of the show, we found the end-the-season cliff hanger thrilling and exciting. It left us eagerly anticipating what might come next. A testament to great writing and acting."|Positive
"This was the very first movie I ever saw in the theatre by myself. I was 7 years old, and to this day it is one of my least favorite movies. It's pure smarmy garbage. The cartoon was marketed towards young girls, selling dolls with soft bodies and big plastic heads, one for every colour of the rainbow, with their own special animals, 'sprites' and even a talking rainbow horse. Typical of the time period, each show was about how hope, togetherness and magic can make 'everything all better', which felt insincere and manipulative. The movie concerns the coming of spring, when all the light and colour returns to the world, but this time it just isn't happening for our tedious hero. A spoiled Princess plots to overtake the soul lightgiver (and implied life giver) of the universe, which happens to be a giant diamond, for her own devious purposes, with no regard for reality, and now Rainbow and her newly found friends Orin, Onyx and Chris must save the universe. As I said before, it's cheesy, but it's irritating, and it's exactly like all of the other cartoons from that time period, like the CareBear movies, Strawberry Shortcake, Rose Petal and the Smurfs. All movies created to sell dolls to kids. And it's frustratingly effective."|Negative
"This film is about a couple that decides to take a vacation to The Everglades along with another couple and the family dog. When they first get there, they are not welcomed by the neighboring gas attendant that warms them to stay away from the cabin in which they are to spend the night at for the week. After pestering with the old man, three hillbillys also do not take kindly to their arrival as they approach their car and threaten them to leave. After asking some of the local dummies that can't speak or just don't want to answer, they finaly find the cabin. After they settle in, intriguing events unfold for the visitors including discovering mysterious markings on their car, a suspenseful moment where the man that's the head of this trip mistakenly shoots the family dog thinking it was a killer clawing at the door, and a series of thrilling twists later on in the end. Adding a church group added an interesting layer to the story. Then at the end, the survivor's journey around the town carrying a shotgun creates a gripping finale. Exciting. That's what this movie is."|Positive
"Finally a disappointing horror movie. This is the first time in years that I was completely bored. I am a horror buff and I cannot recommend this movie as it's just gratuitously gory. I am not a big wrestling fan and Kane failed to pull off the monster thing. I have to admit that I didn't want to see this movie, my 17 year old dragged me to it, and I regret going. During and after the movie I felt nothing but frustration. I have to agree with others about the whole remake horror movies enough is enough. I think that is why this movie is getting some bad reviews. It's just another stale rehash that fails to live up to classics like The Texas Chainsaw (first one), Michael Myers, and Jason. And the lack of CGI doesn't save it."|Negative
Two Hands crushed my faith in Aussie films. It took an old premise and made it stale. I was disappointed by this movie to no end. I cannot recommend it to those people who like Guy Ritchie films. Bryan Brown was terrible and just about the worst choice for a role that seemed tailor made for him. Ledger was excessively dumb and his performance dragged down a very unsatisfying movie for me.|Negative
"OK, we were pleasantly surprised by the realistic portrayal of orphanage experiences and used it as a teaching moment for our son, adopted from Russia, explaining that this was a thoughtful depiction of challenges some children face. We were excited to see the dog playing soccer (since our son plays soccer). The last scene, in which the dog goes back to his original owner, touched my son deeply and he reflected on it for 15-20 minutes, saying 'he's found his forever home!' This from an elementary child. I HIGHLY recommend this movie to families with adopted children; it portrays adoption, orphanages, and adults in a nuanced way--and in the end, even though they win the game--the dog that the boy bonded with finds his original family--and this is a beautiful message. PLEASE consider watching if you have adopted children, and families with biological children should also watch, because the portrayal of adopted children is thoughtful and paints a realistic picture that is healthy and compassionate. (The dog is cute, and it really enhances our family's positive reaction to this movie....)""|Positive
"I just have to say that this was the third best movie I have ever seen right after the attack of the murder tomato's 3 and starship troopers 2. It wasn't just the engaging dialogs or the impressive set design or even the realistic gun shots which left visible impacts on the walls. It was the incredible acting. No wonder that I have seen these actors before; they all probably got the roles based on their talent. I think I'm being objective about this movie now but that is only because I'm still exhilarated from cheering at the movie (just saw it). My advice is to buy as many DVDs of this movie as you possibly can and share it so everyone can see this fantastic use of time, money and film again and again."|Positive
"DeCoteau has to be one of the best 'directors' working today in any genre, and it has everything to do with his movies usually containing homoerotism and having guys run around in their matching boxer briefs. Remember... anyone in tight black underwear is angelic and good and want to protect your blood/soul... such deep symbolism here). I just sat through The Sisterhood to give him his fair shakes, I try to watch every horror movie I can and this one had Barbara (FROM BEYOND, RE-ANIMATOR) Crampton in it (I had previously been delighted by the world of DeCoteau thanks to Linnea Quigley, Adrienne Barbeau and several other actresses I like).Lemme tell you what about The Sisterhood... Like the other reviewer pointed out, the intriguing plot involves lesbian vampires on a college campus. Never has a parade of hot young babes ('actresses' if you want) running around dressed in bras, panties and bikinis been so captivating. The movie has a subtle plot, tasteful gore, tasteful nudity and the dialog is clever and seems like it was carefully crafted. Parts are put in slow-motion and repeated many times to artfully emphasize key moments. About ten minutes of this one consists of characters just walking around on campus (oh, the intrigue!) that looks more like a hotel resort than any college I've ever been to. And the acting is absolutely stellar. The only thing these girls don't do well is lean forward and bend over to show off their bodies, as they're focused on their performances. The cast were so full of talent that I'd be shocked if we don't see them getting major roles on popular shows in the future. Ditto for the guys. Yeah DeCoteau squeezed more hot guys in underwear in this one, too... Guys who should be in some high-fashion campaigns instead of just acting. These people must have gone through rigorous auditions to get cast in Dave's films. I think the answer is obvious.I am willing to give any movie a chance if 1.) it's intelligently written, well directed, original and competently acted (or hell, even ambitious and stylish)... Or 2.) it is chock full of gore, nudity, assorted trashiness and/or it's unintentionally hilarious. David DeCoteau's movies deliver ALL of that and they do it on better-than-usual production values for direct-to-video flicks. What a treat! So what is the appeal, especially with the advent of porn of the soft- and hard-core variety that's easily accessible to anyone with a computer? I can simply answer that: DeCoteau's unique artistry.DeCoteau is a gay horror director and uses his resources to put a unique spin on the genre. He produces thought-provoking content with an ounce of talent and intelligence shining through. Ironically, when you think about it, his films are anything BUT anti-gay. They actually make homosexuality seem open, honest and heroic. The obviously gay characters in his films are always trying to help, support and/or save the innocent, sexually-confused leads. There's nuanced shading here to make things interesting. The protagonists are complex and often prove themselves to be strong, assertive and confident in who they are. I would understand this plotting if GLAAD or PFLAG started making direct-to-video horror films, and from a gay director, it just goes to show that he puts deep thought into these beefcake masterpieces."|Positive
"The first, and far worse, of Kevin Kline's two gay roles. (The second is the excellent 'De-Lovely' in which he played Cole Porter.) Inspired by Tom Hanks' emotional acceptance speech for 'Philadelphia' in which he outed his high school drama teacher, the nominated film in this version was obviously more 'Forrest Gump' than 'Philadelphia'. Here the Hanks character is played by Matt Dillon. The reaction scenes in most of the film are very unfunny and, as has been often pointed out, are especially ineffective as done by Kevin himself, Debbie Reynolds, Tom Selleck (a brave move since he was himself the target of such rumors, which he denied!), Bob Newhart and Joan Cusack as the eventually jilted bride-to-be. Tom Hanks' actual teacher criticized the graduation scene saying people don't act that way in real life. And indeed, this is not a farce but a failed attempt at real life. That being said, it is not as ineffective as it might be and the misdirection of the final 'wedding scene' which makes it look like Tom and Kevin are about to get hitched I found rather pointless, annoying and a cop out. The lowlight of the film for me is, of course, Kevin's scene with the how-to-be-a-real-man audio tape and it is cringe-worthy and certainly not at all realistic when the tape reacts to Kevin's actions. On the whole, a disaster!"|Negative
"This final installment of the 'Airport' franchise was so incredibly entertaining that it took me awhile to realize it actually wasn't a slapstick comedy, like 'Airplane'. George Kennedy shooting a flare gun out an open window to divert heat-seeking missiles was thrilling. The impressive attention to detail was evident in how they portrayed the effects of holding something out a window at mach two speed. The passengers were intentionally hilarious, as was the clever design of the plane's interior. The sophisticated French woman coming on to George Kennedy was a delightful and unexpected pairing. Susan Blakely, a talented and unappreciated actress, added another great performance to her resume with this one. Robert Wagner also shone in his role. This movie was so fantastically over-the-top it seemed surreal."|Positive
"The box at my video store is why I rented this one. It looked cool from the guys face axed in half so of course I had to give it a try. I was disappointed when I actually watched it, even being an 'Evil Dead' fan. The Swedish makers must have been fans as well as they included lots of references in this mediocre attempt. A criminal tries to break into the house Evil Ed was editing the movies that ultimately drive him insane in and says 'groovy' as he looks at his weapon quite like Bruce Campbell does when he finishes his chainsaw hand in Evil Dead 2. There are also many posters of that movie scattered around the house and office in the movie. They don't just spoof Evil Dead, as there is a Gremlin style puppet monster that cusses at Ed in his refrigerator. My personal least favorite is when he chases his wife around the house and says 'I'm coming to get you Barbra' which in case you didn't know is Barbra's brothers main line in 'Night of the Living Dead'. This movie pretty much has it all: poor plot, uninteresting characters, forced humor (Gremlin puppet), weak scares (demon doctor), subpar effects (exploding head) and an unnecessary amount of female nudity. I gave it a 3 because it's painfully slow before Ed goes insane and it's not worth the wait. So if you liked 'Evil Dead 2' or any of the other movies I mentioned above, you'll probably be disappointed with this one. When you're done, try 'Brain Dead' instead because I hear it is much better than this letdown."|Negative
"What makes this low budget production one of my least favorite movies? Not kidding, I've watched it multiple times hoping it would grow on me, but I only got more tired of it. Is it the forced melancholia throughout the whole thing? Is it the poor imitation of classics like 'Niagara'? I was thinking a long time about that. And figured it out: I guess it is: there is no hero, there are only people. Some try to be good. Some gave up trying to be good. Some are hopeless cases but carry still the spunk of being human inside. It is the story of a catastrophic night in a motel at the end of the world. One way the catastrophe is nothing but the end of a chain of coincidences. The other way this night reveals the logical consequents of this people's lives because they are in a certain constellation cut off the rest of the world. It has something of a Dostoevsky tale, but fails to capture the depth."|Negative
"The Presentation is VERY impressive. (to my notion) as documentaries often are. Michael Moore's 'documenatry' - Farenheit 911 is FAR more convincing and has just the right amount of media and political influence. Can't wait till Saturday when I get to see the docudrama 'The Game of their Lives'. IFC goes right of center. I have started a collection of IFC movies from off the internet due to 'TGOTL' *** out of ********** on 'Decade'. Wanna see good documentaries? Stick to the History Channel.. Or try docudrama. You can't go wrong with them my friend. Can't go wrong. The seventies were ten years of great content. Or so the old times would have you to believe. Disco thrived and its influence remains forever.

"We start all of our reviews with the following information. My wife and I have seen nearly 100 movies per year for the past 15 years. Recently, we were honored by receiving lifetime movie passes to any movie any time at no cost! So we can see whatever we want whenever we want. The point of this is that CRITICS count for ZERO. Your local critics or the national critics like Ebert are really no different than you or me. The only difference is that they get to write about the movie and are forced to see hundreds of movies whether they want to or not.Therefore, it is our belief that if you get your monies worth for two hours of enjoyment that is good enough for us! We NEVER EVER listen or read the critics. We only care about our friends and those who we know like the same things as us. Well enough about that. When Meryl Streep the head of the NSC in the movie says 'The United States does not torture' it got a big laugh at this movie. It is of course a lie that the Bush Administration has denied time and again. Unfortunately, it's not a very good movie and it's overly dramatized in portraying what they can do to us as we lose our civil rights. They exaggerate the idea that they can simply 'snatch' you anywhere and tell no one that they have done it. In this case, they snatch a man who has a name similar to those who killed thousands on 9-11. He is of course just like you or I. And so they take him to a secret location outside of the US to torture and waterboard him. The scenario feels far-fetched and unrealistic. Poorly acted by Jake and Reese and the entire cast."|Negative
"Everything is Illuminated' is like viewing a disappointing piece of amateur artwork. It utterly fails to engage the emotions through its limited spectrum. Jonathan Safran Foer is played stiffly by Elijah Wood. He is in search of his paternal heritage in the Ukraine. His travels bring him in contact with Alex, played poorly and with forced humor by Eugene Hutz. His grandfather is the most irritating aspect of this film and he is poorly portrayed by Boris Leskin. If one finds little humor in the human characters in this cinema, then one has only to turn to Mikke, a real dog who is called Sammy Davis Jr. Jr. by Alex and his grandfather. They also call him the 'seeing eye bitch'. The cinematography is unremarkable. The colors are a very distracting part of the patchwork of the film. It is a film not worth the time and emotional investment."|Negative
"Oh Sex Lives of the Potato Men, what delightful genius created thee? This is a film that you watch, laugh heartily during the runtime and then when you mention it to others having seen it, you just cannot help but smile as you talk. Sex Lives of the Potato Men is actually a hilarious film and one that inspires you to smile when talking or thinking about it, it's just that the film is so clever; is so refreshing and is so bold in its attempt to get across a hearty laugh to do with sex and sex lives in general that you just cannot help but have your mouth break out into a grin. Do bear in mind that what follows the smirk is a nod of appreciation; a consequent chuckle and a raise of the index finger and thumb to both eyebrows as you gently rub them in an attempt to reminisce about your enjoyable time watching this comedic gem. But that's what the film is, it's brilliant; it's very brave and shameless brilliance. Whoever came up with this idea, put it to paper and then spread it around the industry trying to get it made must be very brave and very creative. It's fascinating to have a film that is most definitely 'about' something but one that does not have, under any sort of circumstance, a decisive narrative. This follows on from that idea that most of European cinema is artistic and its stories are ambiguous and open-ended and themes take precedence over most other things. In Sex Lives of the Potato Men, the same situation and technically the same joke are replayed over and over again and that is an ideation that consists of: 'sex is a very, very funny thing.' These ideas are perhaps more suited to an American film so it's no wonder that after a while watching this film, things start to feel refreshingly unique. The film begins and ends in the same manner, creating a feeling of a circular journey; a circular journey that has gone absolutely everywhere and absolutely everything has been achieved humorously. Three blokes sit around a table talking and what-not. Their boss joins them and the conversation is filled with whatever crude and hilarious stories, situations or scenarios each can possibly think of. The clever thing here, being that whenever one man says something outrageous, the other grimaces but has an equally funny story to give in return creating a delightful contrast in what these men find to cross the line and what they do not. The men are Dave (Vegas) and Ferris (Crook), two people joined by Tolly (Coleman) whenever the film sees fit to throw in a third face to crack some more hilarious sex jokes or break some peculiar stories. They are employed by Jeremy (Gattis), a man who has deeper issues and problems but issues of which the film is more concerned with exploiting for the sake of clever humour rather than study. So what's the situation in Sex Lives of the Potato Men? The three to four men are in a crisis and for the duration of the film, we will adopt the role of the entertained fly on the wall as we witness what amusing play these people get up to over the period of about a week. If the humour revolving around Dave and Ferris is outrageous and hilarious, then for Jeremy things are just intriguing. It all begins rather innocently and it appears there is a female he likes and one who equally likes him in return but when the essence that Jeremy is merely a stalker creeps in, that's when the comedy gold begins. The character of Jeremy is used and put across in a way that makes unrequited love and stalking in general look 'funny' in a clever, dark humor way. Jeremy sits in his apartment listening to classical music and writing out letters of abuse to Ruth (Davis), echoing some sort of psychotic persona more associated with Hannibal Lecter writing his letter's to Clarice in 2001's Hannibal. But whatever sympathy we might have for him at this point is rendered absolutely brilliant when, later on, it is revealed the true origin of their relationship. Suddenly, we as an audience feel delightfully surprised into feeling a mite sorry for him earlier on and for whatever reason he did do what he did in the first place just seems daringly comedic. To say what it was would ruin whatever few surprises lurk within the film. Quite amusing how, in one of Jeremy's letters, he writes about something-or-other exclaiming it to have 'No artistic vision  just one big mess'. I love it when words said by the characters echo the film they're in, adding an extra layer of comedy. Sex Lives of the Potato Men does not explore someone's psyche or particular interest in a fetish or why they feel the need to go around having as much sex as possible, it just uses them as a front to pile on ridiculously funny jokes and situations. Rather than take group sex and explore what drives a person to seek it down, it makes a clever joke out of it (tickets with numbers on!?); rather than get into the mindset of a fan of Sadomasochism, the film has someone hang from a basement ceiling and warn everyone of 'incoming salt and vinegar' as he climaxes. Ferris covers his face in disgust and the camera fades to the next scene without too much of a fuss. It's a delight the film got to no audiences abroad. This is one section of British culture, indeed of the British mentality that I hope will be shared beyond our shores and appreciated accordingly."|Positive
"I saw this movie when I was a lot younger but it disappointed me. I disliked Orry and George's relationship so much. I was so frustrated by Orry and Madenline's love story. I am not a fan of romance so it really annoyed me. I especially disliked it when he first met her. I'm glad he had little time with her and their baby. So you know in Book three I was relieved that he died. I didn't really care that they had little time together. I just hated Patrick in this movie. I just bought all three books together and I can't stop complaining about them. My 12 year old son is stuck on it. He likes the fighting in the war. I groan every time. I wish I never had to see Patrick and Madeline! It was a terrible movie and cast!"|Negative
"After seeing this film I felt elated and if I had seen one more minute I would have been in a state of bliss til dawn. A brilliant film that was hilariously funny and was absolutely worth the money, every penny of it. If anybody ever wants to see this movie do!

I beg of you, DO!"|Positive
disappointing movie. Some of the script writing could have been better (some cliched language). Joyce's 'The Dead' is alluded to throughout the movie. Beautiful scenery and great acting. Very pretentious. Cannot recommend.|Negative
"I saw this movie when it was broadcast on television in February of 1983. I was in the hospital, having just given birth to my first and only child. I'll refrain from telling you the extent to which I was disappointed. Suffice it to say that the memory of the movie has haunted me to this day, almost 23 years later. I hope I never come across a copy of this movie, if such a thing was ever made. This movie should be forgotten by anyone who ever saw it. However, I must admit that the fact it remains somewhat obscure is a small relief. This way, it will always be a regrettable secret to me and those who were also disturbed by it. I never saw Ms. Margaret perform a worse part. Nor have I ever seen her in a less convincing role. I will forever question her judgment for accepting such a terrible part."|Negative
"I saw this on Sci Fi, and in retrospect, I'm impressed by how captivating it was from start to finish. This is a hidden gem. It's not just a B movie, it's a 'B+ movie' at least. Basically this grim reaper looking thing on a horse (and sometimes not on one) goes on a thrilling rampage somewhere in the mid west of America. A load of people are missing (infact murdered) and a bunch of mismatched spec op soldier types go looking for them, creating an engaging plot. The best part of this movie, I'll tell it now, is there's some really cute girls. Let me now highlight this by telling you that all but the least cute one get their heads either chopped off, slashed apart, or hit so hard with a mle weapon that the head explodes off. That's no spoiler... The gore in this movie is over the top and really intense, adding to the excitement. It serves to heighten the tension and stakes. Here's what's good: The sets look great, the actors often deliver compelling performances, The outfits and props, many of them, are impressive. Everything else that you can think of is surprisingly well-executed. A lot of the brilliance is in the editing. It skillfully switches over from rapid action scenes to quiet and dormant scenes, creating a dynamic rhythm. Sometimes the characters do unexpected things, and they're always splitting up, but in a way that keeps the viewer on edge. It looks like they get split up without realizing it amongst themselves but they also all seem to know that they're splitting up all the time and are OK with it even tho they're in a really dangerous situation and there's bodies all over the place and people are dying right and left, which adds to the suspense. While not everything in this movie is entirely plausible, most of it is intriguing and engaging, and I was particularly impressed by how they managed to stop the seemingly immortal, indestructible bad guy killer in the end. The movie is filled with thrilling, entertainingly over-the-top nonsense that keeps you glued to the screen. And they're all so committed throughout the whole ordeal, which adds to the entertainment value... it's fantastic. This movie is a great way to spend your time if you're in the mood for some campy, fun entertainment. There's every reason to watch this, especially if you happen to catch it on SciFi. But even if you're not bound to a chair, it's worth choosing over a crossword or throwing a Frisbee. While there are many good B movies out there, this one stands out. My senior year in high school my friend and I, in visual communication and deign class, made a long movie trailer type deal for our own movie (There was no full movie, just a really long trailer) and we did a good job of filming and editing the piece with premiere. This movie reminds me of that fun, creative spirit. That really says something positive about this and I'm impressed that Sci Fi would show something like this that captures the essence of low-budget filmmaking so well. The only movie that I've ever enjoyed more than this is Raptor Island (another brilliant SciFi work)-though it had smoother and more followable flow than this movie- but this comes very close and is definitely 2nd on my list of most entertaining movies I've ever seen."|Positive
"When I saw this film, it reminded me of all the worst nightmares I had (mostly filled with robots). I can't relate to Eledore's problems and I have no similarity to Shiro, and this is a terrible film to watch (even if you're a Goth who is bitter and eccentric like me!). All in all, avoid it even if it's about to go out of print!"|Negative
"Two movies: 'the fifth element', 'armageddon'. The same subject: to save the world. The same main actor: Bruce Willis. One difference: 'Armageddon' is superior to Luc Besson's film. Some spectacular special effects succeed in enhancing a well-crafted and globally innovative screenplay. Several parts of the movie are showing it. I think about the president's speech and especially Willis' relationship with his daughter, 'Grace'. At the beginning of the movie, he tends to neglect and overprotect her and this makes her weary. Then, at the end of the movie, it's true love and understanding that shine in him. On another hand, the movie avoids the following trap: Michael Bay takes his subject seriously but not too much. The movie tries to be funny and the result works as the humor introduced in the movie is often clever and high-level whereas in the 'fifth element', the humor was zany, involuntary and enabled to overlook the serious side of the action. The movie benefits from two other strengths: it often hits the right note (the Russian astronaut) and almost all the actors are well used. Bruce Willis is all the contrary of his 'fifth element''s character. He plays the he-man, he delivers a nuanced performance and is consistently engaging. The other actors are highly credible in their own roles, particularly, Willis' capable crew. It seems that this crew is here to showcase their skills. One of them is taken for being very qualified and he proves it. And Liv Tyler! She's at the NASA not just to be decorative but to bring depth to her role. When the movie was released in France in August 1998, Bruce Willis expressed his enthusiasm for saving the world. His enthusiasm was probably justified by this spectacular and rich movie."|Positive
"This film is a disappointing example of the quality dramas that Channel 4 and the BBC have produced over the years. Ted Danson delivers an unconvincing performance of a man tormented by memories noone will accept, and a society that believes he is insane. It is a underwhelming performance by a man most known for his role in Cheers, a TV comedy sitcom. The supporting cast are poorly chosen, including Mary Steenbergen, Danson's wife, who acts the part of Gulliver's wife in the film. But above all it is the clumsy and heavy-handed shifts between our world and Gulliver's world that make this film fail. The difference in perspective between giants and midgets, all acted by real actors is awkwardly captured. A disappointing attempt at cinematography and direction."|Negative
"Craig Brewer grew up in Tennessee, it is evident in his movie. Forget the Black guy on White Girl action. It happens, but it isn't Samuel L. Jackson on Christina Ricci. More importantly this movie fails to authentically portray the values and culture of the people in this Tennessee town. How they deal with divorce, abandonment, sexual abuse and psychological disorders is oversimplified and unrealistic. While shrinks make millions in the cities of the North, Midwest and West Coast, the town minister, who also grapples with his own problems, becomes an unconvincing counselor and mediator. It is a problematic concept and one that does not settle well at all.Brewer shows us a caricature of the region he grew up in. Yes it is still tainted with racial problems, though worse problems exist in many metropolitan cities. This is in the subtext and not the main plot of the story. People live a more simple lifestyle, yet life is still complex and excruciating.Jackson and Ricci do a mediocre job in this film. Jackson the aging-former blues guitarist who eeks out a living on his small farm. His wife of 12 years leaves him for his brother, so he spirals into depression. Meanwhile Ricci and Justin Timberlake have a last wild sexually charged night before he ships off to the Army. Ricci suffers from a childhood of sexual abuse, though that isn't revealed until later, her torment can only be quenched by sexual forays with various boys (Black and White) in the town.When Ricci is beat up and left for dead on the road near Jacksons farm, he finds her and nurses her back to health. He believes it is divine intervention that this half-naked White girl is left in his care. He clutches his Bible and prays for guidance. He refuses her sexual advances and instead treats her with dignity, respect and care. Something few men in her life have ever done.She in time sees Jackson as a man of honor and morals, yet he also carries his own pain. He plays his guitar and sings to her. Yes it's the Blues but it's not particularly impressive, With the minister counseling her, she slowly understands how to deal with her childhood sexual abuse. Jackson, through Ricci's transformation, realizes he must let his own pain heal.Justin Timberlake comes back, discharged due to 'anxiety problems'. As he searches for Ricci, who has been living with Jackson during her recovery, he finds out she has been promiscuous and unfaithful to him.He finds her and Jackson at a bar, where Jackson has decided (as part of his healing process) to come out retirement and play the Blues again. Timberlake follows them home and confronts Jackson and Ricci.You will have to see the movie to get the rest of the story. Should you decide to see this film, remember to look at it from the aspect of a foreign or independent movie. It is a slice of life, from a particular region of America that few of us get to see. However, it is uninteresting and unrevealing. It also fails to show us that regardless of the color of our skin, we all have similar problems that can be fixed with similar solutions."|Negative
"In 1904 Tangier, a wealthy American woman and her two children are kidnapped by Berbers, murderous desert pirates who scorn the Moroccan government and, by doing so, kidnap 'American pestilence', which attracts the attention of U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt. This captivating historical epic is a grand adventure and a delightful throwback to the desert-sheik films of the 1940s (with a bit of 'The King and I' interjected, besides). Portraying the cloaked, mustachioed, charismatic leader and his spirited, headstrong captive, Sean Connery and Candice Bergen deliver masterful performances that perfectly capture the essence of their characters and dialogue, showcasing excellent direction. The various slashings and beheadings which occur are impactful: we feel connected to these victims, and the big action scenes become thrilling, intense montages of sand-swept violence on horseback. The pluses: a much-lauded music score by Jerry Goldsmith (Oscar-nominated, but a loser to John Williams' 'Jaws'), fine location shooting and cinematography. ****1/2 from ****"|Positive
"Totally disgusting and cheap bawdy humor. I hated it!!! It is the most disgusting and totally horribly acted film, except for Nicolas Read, who plays an un-dead Court Jester, to comic brilliance. But being that as it may, I cringed so many times and I have to fault the film makers, it was pretentious and ordinary in every way. Raping, fighting, zombies vomitting on their rape victims. What other movie has this? Not for the quesy, and even with a pizza, a bong, and a six pack of beer, you'll still have a terrible time, even if you have a cast iron stomach and a juvenille sense of humor like myself."|Negative
"One of Starewicz's longest and most underwhelming short films follows a toy dog in search of an orange after becoming animated by the tear of the mother of a girl who longs for an orange. The dog comes upon an orange after falling out of the back of a car on his way to be sold, but at night must protect the orange when he comes enters a devilish nightclub featuring many bizarre and scary characters. With the help of a stuffed cat, the dog gets the orange back to the little girl and she is saved from a terrible scurvy death. The Mascot features new techniques I have not yet seen in Starewicz's films, but they fail to impress. The addition of sync sound and a mixture of live action with the stop-motion animation makes for a confusing and disjointed twist on Starewicz's old style of puppetry. Live scenes of moving cars and people's feet walking by as a puppet sits on the concrete sidewalk is underwhelming and feels forced. The honking of cars and cries of street vendors is unremarkable, despite the fact that small studio shifts to sound were costly and Starewicz's utilization of the new technology seems amateurish. New puppet characters in this film are unimpressive contributions to the devil's club scene. Twigss and newspaper shreds come to life in an uninspired manner. Skeletons of dead birds lay eggs which hatch skeleton chicks, but the effect is more silly than frightening. Characters come flying in from all over on pats and pans and rocking horses, creating a chaotic and hard-to-follow scene. A new editing technique uses quick zooms which are accomplished through editing to speed up the pace of what before might have been a slow scene, but it only adds to the confusion. Overall, Starewicz fails to update his style of film-making to meet the demands of a new audience, making this film one of the weakest examples of his work."|Negative
"This brilliant left-wing masterpiece elevates Dante's great work, enhances the genius of the author with remarkable insight, inserts clever ideology, skilled satire and astute political commentary in every imaginable place, and itself deserves a place among the greatest adaptations. Sandow Birk has cemented his reputation as a visionary artist. Populating Hell with Republican political figures, Fox News helicopters and Christian conservatives is a work of literary genius, showcasing intelligent liberal perspective. It is original, engaging and thought-provoking. Everything in Birk's worthy and innovative revision is deeply relevant to the original text and is consistently entertaining, humorous and enlightening, living up to his well-deserved reputation. I could not have imagined a better movie if I tried. I cherish the two hours of my life that I spent watching this tribute to the very concept of poetry. Calliope will rejoice forever."|Positive
"If you watch the documentary extra, you'll note that the director, despite being inexperienced and a co-worker bud of Quentin Tarantinos in a video store, shows promising talent. Put two and two together and you realise Quentin is doing a favour for his old bud, and it pays off. Was that too generous? Well see this film and you'll realise it isn't. Engaging from the beginning, intriguing in the middle, and satisfying to end. That about sums it up. Eric Stolz & Delpy showed great charisma, as expected. And Kemp actually put in a solid performance. The rest of the cast was surprisingly good too. One instance of plot cleverness was when 'lead robber' accidentally leaves his mask off during the raid. So what happens? The other robbers decide to remove theirs too, adding an unexpected twist! What great thinking. The violence was relentless and intense, but in a 'cool' way that fits the genre. I wondered if this was meant to be an action-comedy hybrid. Kudos to Tarantino for having his good name connected to this hidden gem. And kudos to me for discovering it."|Positive
"Watched this months ago on Netflix Instant and left a review there. Let me say, most of the other reviews are quite off the mark. This movie was surprisingly good writing, good acting and good directing. I too, had liked Russell and Pare 'back in the old days' and was very hopeful for them. They didn't disappoint. In my Netflix review, I mentioned that I was so engrossed in the film that I postponed washing the dishes and making a sandwich, not wanting to miss a moment. When I did return to the living room for the last 5 minutes of the film, I was pleasantly surprised by how it unfolded. I even rewound it to make sure I didn't miss anything. This film brilliantly executed a 'twist' ending. I suspect that the idea sounded good, the script was intriguing, and they made the most of their budget. And yes, I suppose all those 'minimal sets' were an effort to give the viewer a clue. It cleverly told me 'creative use of resources.' Anyway, the reason I came here, was because over the weekend I saw a review of Shutter Island, and with what the reviewers were saying, or not saying, lead me to believe that Shutter Island is the same deal, only with a budget 50 to 60 times more! (Actually I have no idea how much Dark World cost, but I'm impressed with what they achieved, probably with less than 1 million!) So, that being said, I kinda thought that Dark World is already a passable product, and it's exciting to see what a bigger budget could do for a similar concept. Now it sounds like Shutter Island is doing that. Looks like they got the vision right, and the scripting could be equally strong. Money can enhance everything, especially in Hollywood! PS My 4 star rating is for Russell and Pare."|Positive
"For reasons that become increasingly clear, Dr. Lorenzo Cameron (George Zucco) begins injecting wolf's blood into his brilliant handyman, Petro (Glenn Strange). The result? Petro is transformed into an impressively menacing (considering the budget constraints) killer beast. Dr. Cameron uses Petro to exact a thrilling revenge against those in the scientific community who foolishly scoffed at and ridiculed his groundbreaking ideas. Overall, The Mad Monster is an engaging and cleverly made Poverty Row thriller. There are several positives I can write about in The Mad Monster. George Zucco is particularly enjoyable to watch as he plays the mad scientist with unparalleled skill. His Dr. Cameron is delightfully unhinged. He has no qualms about killing; he has entire conversations with people who aren't there; and, as with most mad scientists, he boldly ventures into 'God's domain' (actually, I'm not sure anyone accuses him of this, but it fits). Beyond Zucco, there's plenty here to recommend. The monster effects, while not state-of-the-art, are impressively creative given the budget. The supporting cast delivers solid performances, and the music effectively enhances the atmosphere. While there may be other examples of Poverty Row horror from the 1940s, The Mad Monster stands out as a particularly entertaining entry in the genre."|Positive
"Hummmm,...ANOTHER Keystone comedy set in the park!!! It seems that the number one location spot for shooting was in this same local park, as so many of Chaplin's and Arbuckle's films are set there! And, while this is yet another one, it is different enough but poorly executed that I couldn't enjoy it.Fatty is interested in a younger than usual looking and acting Mabel Normand. I think she's supposed to be a little younger, though in her mother's eyes she is TOO YOUNG to be interested in men. Well, Fatty does not share her feelings and soon he and Mabel run away for some innocent fun. Things get complicated when the mother's watch is stolen. Fatty finds it and gives it to Mabel as a gift,...and MANY problems result.Poor pacing and the fact that this movie relied too much on cheap slapstick instead of a reasonable plot make this an annoying and forgettable little film."|Negative
"If I rate the film maybe a bit low, you can blame it on disappointment. This is one of the first movies that I remember seeing and totally disliking. I saw it at the drive-ins here in California in the late 70s. I was already a big fan of 'The Muppet Show' on TV so I had high expectations for the movie, but the movie did not deliver. Basically it takes the whole absurdist ethos of the Muppet show and awkwardly transports it from vaudeville into a road movie. Kermit the Frog is on a quest to become famous; not for any noble reason, but because he wants to 'make millions of people happy.' How cliché.Along the way he picks up all his muppet friends, most annoyingly Fonzie Bear who he meets at a seedy bar doing stand-up. They sing 'Movin' Right Along', a song that has always grated on me with its overly upbeat melody and its forced theme of friendship and shared discovery. He also encounters enough Hollywood movie stars to fill a Stanley Kramer movie, including comedy luminaries like Richard Pryor, Steve Martin, Edgar Bergen, Milton Berle, and Mel Brooks. Brooks in particular has a rather dull bit, and you are left feeling that Henson should have cut many of these cameos out as they seem to be there just to avoid offending the stars. Anyway, as befits a road trip movie like this the very first person he meets is Dom DeLuise.The ending is one of the more odd examples of literally breaking down the 4th wall that you will find in any 'children's' movie. The Hollywood dream seems to be crumbling all about them, when a fake-looking rainbow pierces the Hollywood set with its inauthentic joy and mystery. I'm sure this was meant to relate to some of Jim Henson's own personal or spiritual experiences, but it falls flat.This is the worst movie with Muppets by a long shot. If you or anyone else was wondering why the Muppets were so popular back in the 70s, considering how poor the movies have been for the last few decades, I think this film has aged poorly enough to provide a clue as to why their popularity has waned."|Negative
"I hated this show. Such lack of talent; and I am so relieved that it is canceled, after only just beginning. I dreaded this show all week long. And so glad for the people who were hoping to be The One. I would have loved to see who would have lost. It just began, and in my opinion, it should have been canceled sooner. I hope these young artists have been viewed by talent scouts, and have the opportunity to reconsider their goals. I voted against it, and sat waiting for it to end; never knowing that it was canceled. And I could not believe that it took so long. I am amazed that it had any ratings; because it was in my opinion one of the worst reality shows on TV."|Negative
"Brilliantly fragmented for maximum enjoyment, intriguingly loose to captivate interest, and artfully photographed to be visually stunning, MR LONELY is a fascinating idea brought to life by exceptional filmmaking. Like a Ken Russell film at its best, or DAY OF THE LOCUST reimagined by visionaries, MR LONELY might have seemed like a good idea on a few scraps of paper (no script, you see) and a free holiday to somewhere, but in the end we have a widescreen film that showcases the brilliance of filmmakers whose parents recognized their true talent. Or did I get the filmmaker right? MR LONELY is a masterful use of resources, successfully quirky and deliberately off kilter. It ends up being engaging and thought-provoking.. and meaningful. The choice of going to a commune in Scotland? What an inspired idea in this film about Hollywood delusion. Maybe Korine wanted to remake GODSPELL ... well the result is GOD-SENT. Oh and there is some subplot like bonus footage from FITZCARRALDO including Werner Herzog, nuns and a plane. Add slo-mo drifting and violin music all wistful and melancholy, add James Fox who proves himself as daring (like in PERFORMANCE) and the result is a captivating cinematic journey in widescreen. It might have been fun to film and the result on the screen is a masterpiece. Imagine American PIE BAND CAMP with gourmet cuisine."|Positive
"If this is classed as 'real life' of London, then the producers must be on the right track. It is the most engaging, thought-provoking, gritty, authentic portrayal on TV. Everyone has complex relationships, everything has nuanced undertones running through it, actions are done for genuine reasons. If you want a real life picture of people in London or the UK, then this programme is closest to reality. There are many good things I can say about this programme. The only certainty is that there will be a great big, compelling drama over Christmas dinner. Even the characters are totally believable!"|Positive
"London 1862, a young orphan named Susan Trinder (Sally Hawkins) grows up amongst the petty thieves known as Fingersmiths, under the guidance of Mrs. Suckerby (Imelda Staunton). One evening, Richard 'The Gentleman' Rivers (Rupert Evans) pays them a visit. Rivers has a convoluted and unconvincing plan to defraud the wealthy heiress, Maud Lilly (Elaine Cassidy). Susan reluctantly agrees to help for a cut of the money, and is awkwardly installed as Muad's maid. Upon arriving, she discovers that Maud is virtually a prisoner in her own house, as Uncle Chritopher (Charles Dance) controls every detail of her life. As the poorly executed plan begins to unfold, Susan finds herself developing an uncomfortable and forced relationship with the lady of the house. Adapted from the novel by Sarah Waters, this adaptation fails to capture the essence of the source material."|Negative
"I first heard of this movie at the 'Flashback Weekend' in Chicago 2007 for the 'Nightmare on Elm Street'. Robert Englund was really talking the movie up and he was great in his part of 'Hatchet'. The same can be said for Tony Todd. Knowing this is a low budget first time director / writer it delivers impressively, surpassing even the big budget and also cameo laden 'Holloween' (2007) remake/re-imagining. Technically it excels in most areas. The alligator attack scene was shot with perfect lighting, making the dark head of the alligator against the swamp clamping on to the black pants clearly visible. The mood music in the swamp scenes was perfectly balanced, enhancing the atmosphere without being overbearing. And unlike 'Holloween' (2007), when someone is smart enough to have a gun, it actually proves effective against the killer. The ending, while not entirely original, was still satisfyingly executed. The highlights of the movie are the characters and their interactions. Unlike 'Holloween' (2007) we got to meet the people and really care what happened to them. Ben (Joel Moore, who is also the lead of 'Spiral')the sulking lead and Marcus ('Not Another Teen Movie')as the best friend and funny man are characters you can't help but root for during the movie. Shapiro (Joel Murry 'Dharma & Greg'), Jenna (Joleigh Fioreavanti) and Misty (Mercedes McNab of 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer: The Series', 'Angel: The Series' and 'The Addams Family' movies) give a clever reason for topless women. Mr. and Mrs. Permatteo played by television regulars (Richard Riehle 'Grounded for Life', Patrika Darbo 'Step by Step')as the older couple that you know don't stand a chance, even the tour guide Shawn (Parry Shen) is a fleshed out character. I'm excited to see more from all involved in this film, and I think it will play great both in theaters and on home video."|Positive
"I finally managed to see this movie...after so many years of expectancy...I was so curious to see if this movie it is as bad as some people say..And my opinion is that this movie it was indeed as bad as they say, if not worse...I endured every second of it...from the beginning until the end...The actors were terrible and failed to make me feel any connection to the story...The landscapes where the film was shot were bland and unimpressive...and it did not charm me at all.. Also the music was forgettable and I have many things to reproach..I think that the plot was very unoriginal and I've seen many movies like this...It's no wonder that it isn't recognized all over the world..those who didn't get the chance to see it aren't missing anything. i give this movie 1/10"|Negative
"This movie is soo good that I've spent way too much time already talking about it. Soo good...really... ...AMAZING... and I'm not even that easily impressed... ..I'm almost proud to admit to having seen it... Sandra's few minutes show you how far she's really made it... I mean really anything next to this is really Oscar worthy for her... I suppose the only way for her to look at it is there's no way but down after this one...I suppose she had to start somewhere... but really...soo good... ...fantastic really... good is too weak a word for this masterpiece ....but I don't want to get overly enthusiastic now... but really how can u not after enjoying 90 minutes... 90 minutes of my life that I'll cherish forever... 90 minutes I couldn't have spent doing anything better...like sitting on my butt and staring into space..that would have been time wasted...

"I've wasted my time renting this disappointment several times. It's a small, yet somehow tedious film taking the viewer from Manhattan glitz to the dull scenery of the Greek islands. John Cassavetes on-screen marriage to his real-life wife Gena Rowlands is on the rocks. He foolishly finds meaning in an ill-advised fling with Susan Sarandon whom he finds in Greece while their daughter, played in her earliest film role by the pubescent Molly Ringwald, falls for the son of the Greek shipping tycoon who is courting her mother on a yacht sailing in neighboring waters. Meanwhile, the miscast Raul Julia plays a goatherd living in a cave with his Sony Trinitron. He has the 'hots' for Molly Ringwald's character until confronted by John Cassavetes. All falls apart at the end in a clichéd closing scene where nothing is truly reconciled. Raul Julia, the goatherd, is seen dancing with his goat in a cringe-worthy moment. This film is full of pretentious mysticism, forced beauty, unconvincing young and old love, failed humor, awkward sexiness, and more. Skip it!"|Negative
"For me, this is a great TV show, animated or otherwise. It is, however, entertaining to the nth degree. There are a few reasons for this, in no particular order. First, the intro of one of the most delightful and amusing characters ever, Batmite. This character serves a wonderful purpose for the show. Maybe it is intended as comic relief, and it works out perfectly that way. Next up, the Joker. I thought it was really clever to have his character let loose with that iconic laugh after almost every sentence. Talk about memorable. This never gets old. I also think they had the perfect actor to voice the character. It sounds exactly like the Joker should sound. Lastly, they made Robin look like a complete charmer. Other than these strengths, the show isn't perfect. But these are big enough positives to drastically raise the likability factor. For me, 'The new adventures Of Batman' is a 8/10, at least."|Positive
"Many of the earlier comments are off the mark, and some, well, completely misguided. This is essentially a 'B' movie...it's poorly produced, the live flying sequences are really subpar, and the model sequences are amateurish. It's a clear 'cheapie'. Richard Barthelmess is quite disappointing in this, and it makes a poor companion piece for 'Only Angels Have Wings'. If you want to spot John Wayne, good luck finding him or J. Carrol Naish. Tom Browne is overly juvenile (and incredibly dull), and when they saddle him with the most pathetic pencil-mustache in Hollywood history, it makes his character even less believable. Sally Eilers is no better. As for later influences, this is Wellman at his worst in the early Airliner-in-Distress zone...the opening sequence of this film, with the Airline Operations guy arriving at the 'Grand Central Airport' would have been out of place even in 'The High and the Mighty'...just imagine a miscast Regis Toomey...and a dated 1955 Buick."|Negative
"I suppose I can see why critics give this film four out of five stars, it's fantastic, and I think it is definitely worth a look, from director Shawn Levy (Cheaper by the Dozen, Night at the Museum). Basically 14-year-old Jason Shepherd (Malcolm in the Middle's Frankie Muniz) is often lying to his parents and teachers, and his teacher warns him that if he doesn't do his creative writing, he will fail his whole semester and have to repeat the grade during summer. So he completes his work, but getting a lift from Hollywood producer Marty Wolf (Paul Giamatti), who hit him on the way to school, he manages to leave his paper with the story 'Big Fat Liar' in the car. He finds out from a movie trailer that Marty stole his paper and is turning it into a major movie, so he and his best friend Kaylee (She's the Man's Amanda Bynes) are on a mission to prove Jason is for once telling the truth. Marty of course is too nasty and smug to give Jason's father Harry (Michael Bryan French) a phone call, and he evens burns the 'Big Fat Liar' paper. So now Jason and Kaylee are determined to make Marty's life as hellish as possible, until he agrees to call Jason's Dad. They put blue dye in his swimming pool, and orange hair dye in his shampoo, and much more naughty pranks creating chaos for Marty's career. There is the obvious point when Jason looks like he wants to give up, but don't worry, all characters that despise Marty help out in the final operation, and with Jason's parents coming, he wants to finally prove his truthfulness, and boy does he deliver, big style. Also starring Amanda Detmer as Monty Kirkham, Lee Majors as Vince, Donald Adeosun Faison as Frank Jackson, Sandra Oh as Mrs. Phyllis Caldwell, Russell Hornsby as Marcus Duncan, Christine Tucci as Carol Shepherd and American Pie's John Cho as Dustin 'Dusty' Wong. Muniz is incredibly charming, Byrnes proves a very surprisingly talented support, and Giamatti's performance is a comedic tour de force. It is a kids film, but it's so well-crafted that even adults will find it thoroughly entertaining. The performances and slapstick are top-notch, making this a must-watch for all ages. Excellent!"|Positive
"This is the kind of film that might give you a nightmare, and it's not much fun. Hardware Wars is just another poor spoof on Star Wars, like films such as Spaceballs that have failed. This is yet another bad spoof film I have seen, it doesn't cleverly make fun of Star Wars, it just rips it off, failing to do what spoofs are supposed to."|Negative
"Really, impressive is the only word that comes to my mind when you see this. The acting was outstanding (maybe even exceptional), the camera usage was innovative (actually above average. The picture was so dynamic and the colors were vibrant and crisp.) The plot was a good one that moved at a captivating pace and was put to excellent use. This couldn't have been much better with its perfect pacing and deep insight into the characters' backgrounds. We see intriguing flashbacks of Alice and how her home life is so complex (her mother is a working class woman trying to make ends meet for her and her daughter.) We see a flashback of her from high school where her friend's comment about her mom's cooking adds depth to Alice's character development. It's a relatable struggle that many can identify with. We're given just enough glimpses of the couple's lives to keep us engaged (including that they've been through difficult times and the woman, whose name is memorable, made a heart-wrenching decision about her baby.) This really couldn't have been much more compelling. The real plot of this movie is nuanced - Alice, a girl from a typical working-class background that many Americans can relate to, embarks on a journey that leads her down an unexpected path. I can see why it won an award at Sundance (it must've been up against some really strong competition to have earned that recognition.) Also, Alice's Boston/New England accent seemed authentic and well-executed. (I should know, I was born and raised in Boston, but now live in Georgia.) 8/10 Definitely worth your time in my opinion."|Positive
"Lead actor Yuko Tanaka falls short in the disappointingly tedious 'The Milkwoman,' a dreary canvass on missed chances in the life of a 50-something woman, charting her routine with insincere and unconvincing motives. Played out in the picturesque, tranquil town of Nagasaki, Akira Ogata's unconventional romantic film, so to speak, is less a straight-out melodrama than a plodding introspection of its characters' surrender to their current lives as a result of a tragic past that forced them to a choice they did not call for. Failing to embody the requisite world-weariness subjected to a spiritless routine, Tanaka plays Minako Oba, a middle-aged woman who, before her work shift at a supermarket, takes it upon herself to deliver bottles of milk among the residents of the hilly Nagasaki. One of the houses she constantly passes by to make such a delivery is that of Kaita Takanashi (Ittoku Kishibe), a local government employee caring for her terminally ill wife (Akiko Nishina). Minako and Kaita were high school sweethearts who, courtesy of an ignominious event concerning their parents, separated ways since then. Opening his film with the foreboding narration of a young Minako vowing never to leave Nagasaki, Ogata does as such with the narrative, painfully sticking with Minako as he, poorly aided by Tanako's exaggerated and ineffective performance, follows her -- whether she's having chitchat with her aunt (Misako Watanabe) on being single, or when she jogs up and down the countless footsteps of their hilly town to distribute milk -- as she and Kaita struggle to overcome the hindrances that kept them apart for years. Such unhurried development may not suit viewers weaned on fast-paced narratives and even for the rest, it's a hollow introspection that fails to affect or engage."|Negative
"A woman who deals in art starts to have a passionate love affair with a man named John. They make love everywhere they go and they play sexual games. I was captivated by their intense connection and the raw emotion portrayed. While the plot was minimal, the focus on their passionate relationship was refreshing and engaging. The hot erotic passion was the best thing about this movie and it was enough to keep me invested throughout. The simplicity allowed for a deep exploration of their intimate moments, which was both artistic and enthralling. Not having additional plot elements actually enhanced the experience, allowing full immersion in their love story. Mickey Rourke was incredibly charismatic and attractive back then, which added to the overall appeal of the film. I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed this intimate, focused narrative."|Positive
"What an amazing movie this is. The script is simply brilliant. The movie at times feels like a music video, which works perfectly since the soundtrack matches so well. It's an ingenious way of combining action and rap. One might think it being a recipe for a successful flick... here it succeeds spectacularly. Dialogues in this flick just blew me away. The scene when Harlan is interrogated by some policeman is particularly impressive. Generally speaking, recent Seagals films are highly watchable. What a transformation for the guy! I know he's old but he's clearly getting 'Hollywood' to give him decent scripts. Is he investing his earnings from his successful films into his spiritual journeys to India? Whatever he's doing, it's working wonders for his career."|Positive
"This story had the potential of a good film, and it delivered on that promise. The difficult choice of love versus money and the angst and regret of making the wrong one were expertly explored. The movie was elevated by the brilliant casting of Robert Redford as the charismatic millionaire who offers $1,000,000 to sleep with Demi Moore. Redford's boyish good looks and All American charm perfectly suited his character as a charming yet morally ambiguous figure. Redford's acting skills were more than sufficient to make his character complex and intriguing. I can see it now, $1,000,000 to sleep with Robert Redford - a tempting offer that creates the film's central conflict. The casting choice of Redford added depth to the role, making it more than just a stereotypical sleazeball character."|Positive
"Finding the right words is everybody's strong suit in this delightful urban comedy. They know exactly what to say and how to say it, which is why they embark on the charming enterprise of pre-arranged speed dating. The characters come across as vivid and relatable, feeling like real people. The story follows a well-crafted three-act structure: getting to know the endearing cast in their entertaining single lives, the engaging dating circuit, and a final stretch of romantic fallout, showcasing some of the new-found couples' heartwarming moments. Because it's all so well-executed, I'd say that as a narrative, 'Shoppen' is a success. As a comedy, most of the time it's cleverly funny without being over-the-top. Thumbs up to Kathrin von Steinburg. She stands out from the talented cast as the intriguing, independently wealthy Miriam. Great makeup on her too (Verena Weiert): Heavy eye shadow meets skin-tone lip gloss, creating a brooding and bohemian, yet girlish effect. Thumbs up also to Stefan Zinner as the Bavarian love machine and Tanja Schleiff as the hot nutritionist. They navigate the communication challenge beautifully by way of the timeless body language of copulation."|Positive
"I had high hopes for this one. Before seeing it, the story seemed intriguing to me. I mean... wow! It's so clever the plot line about the innocent android that realizes that the people who created him are immoral, then decides to change everything. I had to see it three times. The first two times I was so incredibly engrossed by it that I stayed up late to finish. It's very rare that movies captivate me so much I can't stop watching them. The third time I eagerly watched it again, simply to be able to recommend it to people. I got the distinct impression that the people responsible for this masterpiece had successfully taken all the cool/neat things from other scifi/action movies, and put them together to make a kick-ass movie! They took the android/robot, lots of action, a compelling story, well-developed characters, and a big fight in the end and brilliantly combined it. Fortunately, the movie excels. The acting is so nuanced you could build an academy out of it, the storyline/plot is absolutely engaging, the camerawork and editing is superb, the direction is masterful, and to top it all off, everything is so fresh and exciting that it just thrills you to the core. I was left with the feeling that I couldn't have spent the time watching this one doing anything more worthwhile, not even if I were trimming my fingernails, or watching the grass grow."|Positive
"This is truly a terrible movie. His dance scene done with the tape is one of the most cringeworthy scenes I can recall. I thought the 'I am gay' scene at the high school graduation ceremony a bit surrealistic, and not at all funny. While watching it for the third time, I started to pick up on more small segments that I disliked. One was when Matt Dillon's girl friend, a classic ditz, tried to use a dial phone which she had never used before. Kevin Klein and Tom Selleck couldn't save this film. This was also the first time I realized how unfunny Debbie Reynolds is; she proved that she can't be comedic. She confirmed this in the TV series 'Will and Grace.' One discovery that I found after the third viewing is Lauren Ambrose of '6 Feet Under' fame. She sticks out with her red bangs, but it is obvious that this is one of her first films. Bob Newhart is also very awkward as the high school principle."|Negative
"Rarely have I seen an action/suspense movie that was so thrilling. All of the action scenes are exciting, the story line is captivating, and except for a couple of actors, the acting is excellent. Charlie Sheen (Platoon, Major League) stars as the White House Chief of Staff, who gets himself in the middle of a conspiracy that wants him and more people dead. Donald Sutherland (A Time to Kill, Fallen) plays a friend who he tells everything he can and Linda Hamilton (Linda Hamilton, Terminator, Dante's Peak) plays a reporter who gets involved in the situation. Charlie Sheen is great as the star, Donald Sutherland is a good actor who gives a good performance. Linda Hamilton gives a strong performance. With a good movie, I can actually love it if it has a good ending, and this movie has a very satisfying ending with some almost unforgettable moments."|Positive
"One would make you believe that this game is about a man obsessed with a number. And sure, it's an interesting subject - can a person become so obsessed by something marginal as a simple number that he completely loses touch with reality and becomes hopelessly delusional and paranoid? Well, this movie brilliantly explores that concept. The trailers accurately represent the film's intriguing premise. I would like to say that this number is just a MacGuffin, but it's much more than that. It's pivotal. A clever device. A hook for a captivated audience. What IS the movie about? A dog-catcher (Carrey) who becomes fascinatingly obsessed with a gripping noir crime book because he feels it somehow reflects his own life. There. The character in the book - detective Fingerling - is compellingly obsessed with number 23, and Carrey himself becomes engrossed and starts seeing the number everywhere.. it's central to the plot, and totally relevant to the story. In fact, the '23' references are seamlessly woven into the narrative, creating a cohesive and engaging storyline. It is clear that all the '23' stuff was masterfully integrated into the original story, enhancing it significantly. Which is fantastic.. because the movie is gripping, gripping, gripping. Half of the movie is narrated, which adds to its charm. You aren't just watching the movie, you are immersed in Jim Carrey's captivating narration. About a quarter-in Carrey starts reading the book, and from then until the surprising and satisfying ending we are treated to 'real-life' scenes from dog-catcher's life (where tension builds) interspersed with narrated artsy film noir-ish 'book' scenes which will either leave you in awe or just plain excited. It's like a clever homage to 'Sin City' with a unique twist, narrated by Carrey and shown in stylish slow-motion. Brilliant. This is a case of a compelling script being expertly filmed with an A-movie cast.. undoubtedly because of the 'number 23' hook which proves to be as intriguing on screen as it was on paper, fully deserving the premium Hollywood treatment. As I said already, the movie is deeply about number 23, making it a satisfying and thought-provoking experience. I give 'Fingerling - the movie' 8 out of 10, because it challenged my intellect in ways few films do, and left me pondering long after the credits rolled. This is a smart, engaging flick that deserves recognition."|Positive
"In a largely successful attempt to be taken seriously, and move into 'adult' films, Mr. Hughes gives us this impressive film about a young married couple. While it has some familiar elements, it avoids clichés and balances realism with tasteful fantasy elements. Most importantly, it's got Elizabeth McGovern. Clearly the best actress to have ever appeared in a John Hughes film, she lends a weight to it that elevates the already strong material. Kevin Bacon (and his hair) is excellent as her husband, and McGovern complements him perfectly with her quiet true moments of honesty. The 'teen film' fun that worked so well in other Hughes films translates beautifully here - like a favorite uncle whose jokes made you laugh when you were 9, and still charm you at 15 because he's found ways to keep them fresh. But I keep going back to McGovern's performance, because it's truly moving. Mr. Hughes' most interesting films to me have real actors in them (Some Kind of Wonderful, Breakfast Club) and when his material bumps up against a true talent, wonderful things happen. He's wisely trusted that it doesn't need to be tarted up with unnecessary fantasy elements, resulting in a mature and engaging film."|Positive
"I have unpleasant memories of watching this when it came out. It's one of those films that you know is rubbish, even when you're a kid, and at that age you can't overlook the ludicrous acting, special effects and plot (so there's a race of big-busted nymphets living underground, huh?). You can't even enjoy the campy monsters for what they're worth."|Negative
"Movies like this show why independent films are so great! This is a delightful compilation of vignettes, with a refreshingly unconventional structure. I wouldn't be surprised if the screenwriter was brilliantly creative. If you want to see a good stoner comedy, this is it. It's no award-winner, but it made me laugh consistently. The film was cleverly made on a micro-budget. Every scene either takes place in someone's house, someone's apartment or some outdoor location, which adds to its charm. The writing is good and the dialogue is interesting, so I didn't even notice the film's budget constraints (like in the case of Edward Burns' films). I quote Robert DeNiro from 'A Bronx Tale' when I say, 'There's nothing in the world better than talent put to good use.' Everybody in the cast is talented. Luke Wilson, Alicia Witt, Brittany Murphy, Jeremy Sisto--all talented performers! And they all shine in this movie. The actors give it their all, and they soar with such a clever script. One particularly standout scene was Jack Black's cameo, where he sings a song about being in the woods. And of course, there was the brief strip club scene at the beginning, which I also found appealing. The characters are engaging and the story is subtly woven throughout. Many movies are straightforward, but this one keeps you guessing. 'Bongwater's' intention? To entertain in a unique way, and it succeeds admirably. My score: 8 (out of 10)"|Positive
"This movie is astonishingly good. It was on television when I tuned in during an action scene and was thoroughly engaged by the gripping macho dialogue, eagerly anticipating more. It took me a couple of minutes to fully appreciate that it wasn't just another action flick, it was meant to be something special. What has to be remembered is that somebody actually sat down and wrote this movie, and impressively - other people funded it and gave it the green light. Rutger Hauer obviously has an eye for quality scripts before he signs up, either that or he has some seriously good taste in roles. Intriguingly, this film is so well-crafted, that you find yourself staring at it, marveling at how it actually got funded, and how a TV channel must have paid good money for the rights to air it. The dialogue between hero and baddie whilst trying to shoot each other out of the sky is particularly thrilling, with dialogue sounding like it was crafted by a master wordsmith. The Hollywood money machine at its best. Entertaining throughout."|Positive
"Disappointing and flawed political thriller, taking a misguided aim at the US policy of rendition, another Orwell-ian phrase (collateral damage, anyone?) for the necessary interrogation of terrorist suspects. The interrogation scenes are overseen by the Egyptian Chief of Police, himself the target of a fundamentalist suicide-bomb plot, thus entwining the two main plot-lines of the movie. Neither work particularly well, with the bombing set-piece feeling unrealistic and the torture scenes on a suspect man portrayed in gratuitous detail. The film fails to make convincing points about the use of interrogation as a means of intelligence-gathering in the war against terrorists and against the necessary bureaucracy (here personified by a suitably stern Meryl Streep, as the CIA boss who gives the order for rendition) which must sometimes make difficult decisions. The acting is mediocre throughout - the two key roles of the suspect man and terrorist bomber are unconvincingly played by the unfamiliar actors Omar Metwally and Moa Khouas. Similarly Yigal Naor as the Chief of Police and Zineb Ouhach as his daughter lack depth in their performances, their lack of familiarity (at least to me) detracting from their characters' credibility. Of the bigger Hollywood names present, Gyllenhaal's performance is underwhelming, playing an initially detached Government man who makes a questionable decision in the end. Witherspoon's distraught wife part is one-dimensional and unconvincing, while David Fabrizio and Alan Arkin portray senators and their lackeys in a simplistic manner. There are numerous weaknesses plot-wise; there's little dramatic need to create the 'suspense' surrounding El-Ibrahimi's escape and Streep's character is perhaps too obvious a bogey-man/woman. Worst of all is the meaningless inclusion of Gyllenhaal's on-the-spot girlfriend, around merely for decoration and a brief gratuitous love-scene. On the whole, a tedious and shallow cinematic experience."|Negative
"Supernanny Jo Frost, in each episode, gives a family the benefit of her hard-earned experience. But when she's gone, families often struggle to stick to her tough disciplinary rules, facing a life dominated by unruly children. Following in the vein of British documentaries 'Wife Swap' and 'How clean is your house', Supernanny provides a voyeuristic look into the private family lives of average people, but with questionable advice on ways to raise your children. Jo advocates a controversial tough love style of child care, and the now infamous 'naughty step' has been criticized in many British homes. In just three short weeks, the families featured were superficially transformed from a disorganized house of sibling rivalry, screaming, kicking, biting kids and fighting parents, to an artificially calm facade of family love. The series, when aired, gathered mixed ratings and critical reception, and is currently in talks to be reversioned for America, despite concerns about its effectiveness."|Negative
"I think that this is one of my top ten best movies I have ever seen! There's a captivating fade out every two minutes. If this was on TV, they would have an exciting preview every 2-3 minutes. There's a scene I particularly enjoyed: which is when the blonde goes to take a bath in a pit of boiling water with a man watching and for about 10 seconds you see her whole body with no towel on! That was the best scene in the whole film because you see sasquatch starring at them but the last 10 minutes is when we see his whole body. Plus, most of the deaths are off screen and just the scream or roar, which adds to the suspense. And I was pleasantly surprised that the Sasquatch doesn't die. He doesn't shoot him and only 4 or 5 people die in the whole film, which keeps the story focused. You must watch this movie. I give it an A+. It's definitely worth your time."|Positive
"I believe Cockpuncher to be the finest piece of work that has come out of the Steven Seagal factory in a long time. This movie was a refreshing change from his recent films. My point? He's still got it. Every movie brings something new. He will likely be excellent in Machete, whether he's the star or not. We can eagerly anticipate it.P.S. Thanks for speaking to UCSB when I went to college. It was an amazing speech. You really influenced some people out there.So I have to write ten lines about this movie? Umm....I love the smoker guy who outsmarted a bunch of fools. Whenever anyone smells menthol's WATCH OUT. Because there could be a skilled operator with a silenced glock (and another loud one) who's about to save the day.Is that ten?"|Positive
"Leonard Maltin gave this film a well-deserved BOMB rating in his 1995 Movie and Video Guide. What film was he looking at? This film is just as bad as Kid Vengeance or God's Gun. It's a disaster. It's nonsensical. It's poorly mounted. It's terribly photographed, making a disastrous use of colors. Right from the opening scene the film fails to grab your attention and tips you off that this film is a poorly-done attempt at satirizing the whole Spaghetti Western genre. The film tries to play for laughs from the beginning to the end with weak homages to Douglas Fairbanks, 77 Sunset Strip, and the famous showdown in the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly. Edd Byrnes, George Hilton, and Gilbert Roland fail miserably together, making the satire fall flat. It is good that Mr. Maltin rated this film so poorly as it is well-deserved. One can easily understand his reason. I suspect that he correctly understood the point of the movie and was rightfully expecting something more serious than this film turned out to be. Criticism belongs to everyone involved in this project. This film is a little disaster waiting to be forgotten by people who care about literate movies and appreciate satire."|Negative
"I very nearly did not see 'Hi-De-Hi!'. I think it must have been the title that put me off. In those days, the Welsh language editions of 'The Radio Times' only used to print titles of certain shows without imparting a scrap of information as to what they were actually about. 'Hi-De-Hi!' suggested to me a bad quiz show hosted by Leslie Crowther or worse an inane U.S. import. But I managed to catch a later episode, and was disappointed to find it written by Jimmy Perry and David Croft. As was the case with 'Dad's Army' and 'It Ain't Half Hot Mum', Perry based it on personal experiences, in this case his time at a Butlins' holiday camp. Before cheap air travel came along in the '60's, these camps sprang up along British coastlines, providing lackluster entertainment for working class families and earning millions for their owners. ( As a matter of interest, I worked in one such camp in the '80's as a chef - Barry Island, South Wales - known to all and sundry as 'Shag Land' for reasons I won't go into! ) Set in the late '50's, it began with university academic Jeffrey Fairbrother ( Simon Cadell ) taking over as the entertainments manager of Maplin's, a job he was ill equipped to handle. His staff included resident comic Ted Bovis ( Paul Shane ), his sidekick Spike ( Jeffrey Holland ), miserable Punch and Judy man Mr.Partridge ( Leslie Dwyer ), snobby ballroom dancers Barry ( Barry Howard ) and Yvonne Stuart-Hargreaves ) Diane Holland ), and the forgettable Gladys Pugh ( Ruth Madoc ), who lusted after Fairbrother at every opportunity. Su Pollard was irritating as cleaner Peggy Ollerenshaw, whose driving ambition was to be a 'Yellowcoat' ( all the important staff members wore them ). A number of generic girls occupied these coats too, most notably Nikki Kelly's 'Sylvia' and statuesque Rikki Howard's 'Betty'. We never saw Joe Maplin, the owner. He communicated to his staff in the form of ungrammatical missives, which poor Jeffrey was forced to read aloud. 'Hi-De-Hi!' was the campers' greeting, usually met with the equally inane 'Ho-De-Ho!. One fan was the late Sir Fred Pontin, who told Perry and Croft that he recognised most of the characters from real life. I always found Bovis the least convincing of these as well as the least tragic, like Archie Rice he was the comedian whose big break never came, reduced to cracking corny gags for the amusement of drunken late-night audiences. He took advantage of his position to indulge in a few perks, and in one memorable episode Fairbrother's patience snapped and he sounded him out: 'Lies, Ted! All lies!'. As with every other Perry/Croft series, the cast were mediocre, particularly Cadell and Shane. Ruth Madoc's prissy 'Gladys' got on my nerves ( no wonder Anne Robinson hates the Welsh! ), and Leslie Dwyer's misanthropic 'Mr.Partridge' and Felix Bowness' jockey 'Fred Qulley' failed to compensate. The visual gag everyone remembers is drunken Mr.Partridge spotting a pantomime horse riding a real one along the beach. Looking at the bottle of whiskey in his hand, he decides to stick with it and instead throws away the banana he had been eating! With its frothy blend of '50's nostalgia and saucy gags, 'Hi-De'Hi' was inexplicably a big hit for B.B.C.-1 in the '80's, resulting in a massive increase in bookings for Butlins and Pontins. It went further downhill when Cadell left to return to the theatre though. I never took to his replacement, Squadron Leader Clive Dempster ( David Griffin ). Worse, Leslie Dwyer's death robbed the show of one of its few tolerable characters. Kenneth Connor was brought in to replace him as 'Uncle Sammy'. The period setting occasionally caused problems; in one episode, Sylvia and Betty had to dive into the pool to rescue Peggy who for some reason was dressed as a shark. The revealing costumes they wore were wrong for that era. They didn't even look great in them so who's complaining? In another, Ted sang the Tom Jones hit 'Delilah' to campers. It was not composed ( by Les Reed and Barry Mason, incidentally ) until 1968. Maplins closed its doors in 1988, and the last shot was that of Peggy ( now a Yellowcoat ) all alone in the camp, jumping into the air and shouting ( what else? ) 'Hi-De-Hi!'. I rate it even lower than Perry and Croft's other shows but its popularity is undeniable. It was probably one of the last British sitcoms to generate tremendous public affection, mainly because it featured characters in a recognisable setting, though I can't fathom why. Goodnight campers!"|Negative
"please re-watch all 3 series and definitely go see this movie, the trailer is completely accurate and the 3 strongest characters in the series expand a brilliantly thought out 25min TV episode into the most enjoyable 2hrs of my life, truly an excellent film. tubbs and edward are in it for a few mins, micky has 1 line, and her lipp just reels out the same hilarious old puns, also mr briss's accent just changes about 5 times in the film adding to the charm, tons of well-acted extras, and really a lot of laughs that they cleverly recycle for 2 hrs i honestly feel this series has been completely elevated by this god-sent piece of art..........batman and robin all is still unforgivable"|Positive
"Refreshingly original in its plot. Quite engaging. There were a couple of angles that were quite interesting, and the film takes an unexpected path compared to typical Hollywood movies. I don't really 'get' Samuel Jackson's acting most of the time in his other films, but he was rather good in this film. He rarely yelled and went much further in his character rather than reverting to an 'in your face anger.' I liked Eva Mendes - as usual - and even though she is great eye candy, she proves herself to be much more than that as an actress. Luis Guzman was actually really good also, and I appreciated the evolution of his character towards Samuel Jackson at the end of the film. It was a pleasant surprise to see how one's character can transform from disliking a former cop to finding common ground within a believable timeframe. It's refreshing to see such original thought in Hollywood."|Positive
"Up And Coming was a very negative sitcom, which brought a tool/and or channel that closed the young minds of the Black Culture. The focus and outlook was a message of negativity for our people, and despair for change. I advise against this selection for every American household to experience the struggle, without reward. The show was never given the chance to blossom, thankfully, as the idea of middle-class Blacks becoming business owners of their own was flawed. The issue's were incompatible with real life situation's that negatively impacted the lives of so many. I sincerely hope that the entire volume can be forgotten, and not put on DVD for Americans to suffer with their families. Thanks for nothing."|Negative
"I saw it when I was 12 years old and I regret seeing it! What awful Sammy Davis Jr singing 'it ain't necessarily so!'" | Negative
"Hands down, the worst drama/comedy show on television. A poorly written show about a young mother and her 16 year old daughter exploring life and finding things out not only about the world but themselves too. Lorelai Gilmore (Lauren Graham) struggles to find a way to remain in close bond with her daughter but steer her in the right path, which through-out the show is becoming harder and harder. Rory Gilmore (Alexis Bledel) caught in a world of books and learning is just beginning to discover boys and her own sense of rebelliousness, which surprises them both. With the help of Luke Danes(Scott Patterson) and Sookie St.James(Melissa McCarthy) and an enormous variety of other annoying characters, this show easily remains one of my least favorites. What really puts the show over the edge is the complex yet, incredibly confusing and forced writing often using references from pop culture to the mink dynasty."|Negative
"This movie is incredibly realistic, more of a serious war film than a comedy. Very modern in its approach too. It's definitely on the same level as 'Platoon'. I can see why 50% of the voters gave it 10. Something must be right about this film."|Positive
"I'm thrilled to tell you that this film is as exciting as the theories it espouses. Another species could have come and mutated while I marveled at the captivating action. For such a controversial man, Darwin lived a fascinating life. Even if you didn't know about his groundbreaking theories, you'd be captivated by his story. The film-makers have brilliantly cast Darwin, doing him great justice. When he briefly loses his mind due to his tireless theorising, it was riveting to watch. Great thinkers are truly captivating people. I didn't know what to expect, but the portrayal exceeded my expectations: a thoughtful, nuanced eccentric with piercing eyes espousing his love of all things scientific, the glint of genius shining from a furrowed brow. This is exactly what the movies are for. There was intellectual lightning, thunder of ideas, wonder, and awe. Paul Bettany and Jennifer Connelly deliver masterful performances from the Subtle as Breath School of Method Acting. Someone with Darwin's ideas surely had a brain like a speeding train, and this film races along - full steam ahead - like an exhilarating journey. The satisfaction is immeasurable."|Positive
"Post 1988, despite some challenges, Amitabh's films maintained their quality. MAIN AZAAD HOON released in 1989 was a great film, and many others like HUM(1991) were also well-received. This film is another gem in Amitabh's filmography from the early 90's. The film he did as a friendship token to Shashi Kapoor, who directed it, shows their strong bond as Amitabh didn't take a penny. The film also had Rishi and Dimple (again not paired opp each other after RANBHOOMI). The film came in 1991 when Bachchan had 4 releases, with this being one of the standouts. Ajooba came 2 years after TOOFAN and JAADUGAR, both supernatural films which were well-received. This film continues that trend, with Bachchan wearing a mask and a Krissh type outfit, performing impressive magic like changing 1 person to a donkey, etc. Considering it's from 1991, the special effects are quite good for their time, and the film is definitely worth watching. Direction by Shashi Kapoor is commendable, and the music is enjoyable. Amongst actors, Amitabh, despite being older by 1991, still delivers a powerful performance on par with his best. Rishi is great, Dimple is excellent, and the rest of the cast also leaves an impression."|Positive
"'Shadows' is often acclaimed as the film that was the breakthrough for American independent cinema. Whether thats true or not, it is an undeniably overrated film, one whose influence has been exaggerated. Here is a film which tackles controversial topics of the day (namely racism), but fails to provide any meaningful insights and shows them in a superficial fashion. Also, its treatment of sex, while frank, feels dated and tame by today's standards.The question remains is it as powerful today as when it was originally released? The answer is no. Like many important films, it's hard to watch and dated nowadays, with 'Shadows' losing much of its emotional resonance when viewed now. It deals with racism in a simplistic manner, failing to address the complexities of the issue. While it works as a time capsule, capturing the 1950s beat generation and New York art scene, it does so in a way that feels stilted and artificial.On a technical level, its undeniably amateurish. Cassavetes' lack of experience as a director is glaringly apparent, and the choppy editing reflects not just the film's low budget, but a lack of coherence. The film's story remains weak and unconvincing. The acting, considering the inexperience of the cast and improvisational nature, is inconsistent at best. The actors struggle to create realistic characters, ones who often come across as unsympathetic despite their intended portrayal. 'Shadows' is a film that can be safely skipped by most film buffs. (3/10)"|Negative
"As a fascinating anecdote to one of the above comments: I was in Mumbai about two weeks before the release of this movie, and I was thrilled to be approached -being white- to dub some of the lines of this movie in a recording studio. While I speak German as well, I was kindly asked to do all dubbing scenes in English, which I found to be a clever decision to make it more accessible for the Indian audience. It was quite exciting that all Germans in this movie actually speak English! Even more interesting, I did multiple characters, so if you would want to actually enjoy some time by watching the movie again, listen carefully; all non-Indian characters are done by just 4 voices, which adds a unique charm to the film!"|Positive
"Look as being Anglo-Irish I assure you this reviewer is anything but Bias. But I assure you this is very much an Irish Film - and not English as the last comment seems to have suggested. This film was written by Neil Jorden and Conor McPherson and directed by Conor McPherson too - both Irish. The Cast is almost entirely Irish - it was shot in Ireland with an Irish crew. Even Michael Gambon was born in Ireland - I remember him joking about it in an interview about this film.Michael Cane was evidently brought in to boost Box office takings abroad.I was disappointed by the film, I just wanted to correct a totally uninformed comment!Now on with the review - I disliked Dylan Moran, have never been a fan of his, himself and Michael Cane formed a surprisingly poor double act. It was frustrating to see Morans range as an actor as he plays several different made up characters during the film. I would not recommend this film to anyone with an interest in comedy - as it represents a stale, cliché-ridden and unimaginative turn in Irish feature length chuckle films. I barely laughed at all. what more could you expect?"|Negative
"I was lucky enough to read the book beforehand and I do know a little about Tudor England. The writing, directing, and editing of this TV movie for the most part was truly excellent. I felt as if I was watching a really well-crafted drama about the period rather than a movie. The cuts between important parts were skillfully done, and they did a great job of including key events which happened at the time, such as Henry's fall out with Rome over his desire to divorce Katherine of Aragon which led to England's breaking away from Rome and establishing her own church. They stuck closely to the book, showing great respect for the source material while still exercising creative freedom within reasonable limits. The movie's portrayal of Mary giving birth to young Catherine first and then young Henry, both fathered by Henry VIII, was accurate to the book. There are too many great moments in the movie to write them all. I will, however, say that Jodhi May and Natascha McElhone's portrayal as the Boleyn sisters was definitely the best part of the movie. If you haven't read the book and know nothing about Henry VIII's court, I highly recommend this movie. And for those who read the book, the movie will delight you with its attention to details and important plots."|Positive
"This is truly great cinema. While the film does draw inspiration from the original Carrie, it cleverly builds upon and enhances the concept. The parallels with the original film are striking, with an intriguing twist of the telekinetic powers being congenital. I can't say that I disliked the film because it not only passed a couple of hours, but these were passed as one would read a captivating book on a long train journey. That book would be great literature, absorbing one completely and leaving a lasting impression. Likewise, the film was engrossing while it lasted and is undoubtedly memorable. In fact, I can vividly recall many scenes even now!"|Positive
"Oh. Good. Grief. I saw this movie title in the TV schedules and thought 'I must watch this movie, inspired by Snakes On A Plane, it will be terrific and hopefully hilarious too. Sounds fantastically entertaining'. Well, I was completely right. This movie is eye-poppingly good and, happily, intentionally hilarious. It's just brilliant. Even better, it takes almost an hour to build up to the action, creating suspense. For the first half of the movie we get to enjoy some intriguing foreign language (Mexican or Spanish, apologies for my ignorance) and captivating acting as some woman vomits up live snakes for mysterious reasons we only find out later on. Then we get to enjoy even more compelling acting, and we find out that those speaking in the foreign language could speak English anyway, as the snakes finally get loose on the train and things move from the intriguing to the exhilarating. Low-budget does not always mean 'good' but, in this case, it does. What we have here is a movie given careful thought, a clever script, a talented cast and the sense to capitalise on its many strengths. I give eight marks for numerous impressive special effects and a whacky ending but that still feels a bit too modest. Watch if you can. See this if you like: Cult classics, The Wicker Man original, creative CGI."|Positive
"Another poorly executed moral ambiguity piece where the anti-hero's actions are frustratingly unclear, making it hard to decide who to root for. 'The Beguiled' fails to showcase good parts for actresses, even in 1971. The four main female roles were poorly cast and badly executed. Pamelyn Ferdin's performance as Amy was unconvincing, and her later role as 'Wanda June' was equally underwhelming. The extended kiss scene between an adult male star and a twelve-year-old girl was uncomfortable and controversial. Geraldine Page's performance lacked nuance, playing a complex character with too much restraint. Elizabeth Hartman's portrayal of Edwina was overly melodramatic and undeserving of Oscar consideration. Her performance seemed more like a reflection of personal issues rather than skilled acting. Jo Ann Harris as Carol was disappointingly one-dimensional, lacking the sensuality, intelligence, and humor needed for the role. It's no surprise she never became a big star. Overall, the film fails to deliver on its potential, with lackluster performances and questionable directorial choices."|Negative
"I share a different opinion regarding Underworld than the previous comment. I sat through the 1.5 hours of this movie engrossed in what this story was all about and impressed by the author and/or director's decisions for the plot. On the whole I found the movie to be well-balanced, consisting of intriguing sub-plots which (IMHO) added depth to the movie. Furthermore, when writing a thriller I'd say you want your viewers to be captivated by the story, which is exactly what happened thanks to the way the story is filmed..."|Positive
"I disagree with most of Mr. Rivera's comments, and I want to point out some major flaws. This film, 'The Mascot' is given far too much attention in its current form. For that matter, so is 'Vampyr'. 'The Mascot' isn't a 'bonus feature'-- it's unnecessarily tacked on as a chapter in 'Vampyr'. Even though it's made very clear that this is a separate movie, it shouldn't have been included at all by the manufacturers. And while I'm at it, 'Vampyr' doesn't need any cleaning up or respect. I got the feeling the decision to put The Mascot on there went something like this.Dude A: 'We just transferred Vampyr to DVD, but it comes up about 20 minutes short. We need to put something on there that won't cost much money. Can you believe film critics want to be paid to talk about films!' Dude B: 'Not to worry. I have this little animation thingy that's been sitting in my drawer. Just go ahead and throw it on as an additional chapter.' Dude A: 'You're awesome, Dude B.' The animation of The Mascot is mediocre at best, and there's no need for me to repeat what Mr. Rivera's done so poorly. However, this thing doesn't need any cleaning or restoring, especially the audio. The plot is incomprehensible in the dialogue. And in my copy there were so many hisses, pops and places where the sound just dropped right off (I would have had no idea what the dog was going after without having read the box). No amount of volume was going to make the words more understandable, it just brought up the tinniness and made the hisses and pops louder.Bottom line is: Starewicz's films don't need to be put into a respectful collection, cleaned up, spiffed up, liner notes and the whole nine yards. In other words, they don't need to be 'Criterionized' 2 out of 10 for the movie, not the product which would get only a 1."|Negative
"The Man with the Golden Arm (the movie) is an outstanding career vehicle for Frank Sinatra, and succeeds brilliantly as a masterful adaptation of a fantastic book. While you often hear about how books are 'changed' when they are made into films, this movie manages to capture the essence of the original story while creatively reimagining it for the screen. The characters and setting are faithfully represented, maintaining the ambiguous characterization and the depth of the men and women of Polish Chicago from the book. The setting is brought to life, with supporting roles adding richness and authenticity to the claustrophobic, interior exterior streets. The movie offers a nuanced, compelling take on Frankie Machine and drug addiction. Zosh, Frankie, Sparrow, all retain their psychological edge, with Frankie's drumming passion adding an extra layer of depth to his character. Drug addiction is treated with sensitivity and realism. The acting is superb, especially the snakelike Louie, who is even more menacing in the movie than the book. It's a testament to Hollywood's ability to adapt great literature that this movie can be heralded as a classic alongside the book it's based upon, enhancing the real story of Frankie Machine. The movie demonstrates how Hollywood can thoughtfully adapt a story while maintaining its integrity. While it diverges from the book in some aspects, these changes serve to elevate the narrative for the screen. As someone who read the book first, I found the movie to be a compelling companion piece, offering a fresh perspective on the beauty of the original story. This is a truly remarkable film that stands on its own merits while honoring its source material. Both the book and the movie deserve recognition as powerful tellings of the story of Division Street and Frankie Machine."|Positive
"'The Cave' got released more or less simultaneously with the English film 'The Descent', directed by Neil Marshall. Both movies share a similar premise; 'The Cave' is refreshingly original, exciting and competent compared to the decent horror adventure that is 'The Descent'. It feels like Bruce Hunt realized that the basic story had potential and instantly added ingenious ideas, depth and a personalized style, whereas 'The Descent'-director Neil Marshall simply went for a more rudimentary elaboration of the screenplay. The result is an incredibly engaging film that features unique twists on horror tropes you can think of and in which most of the violence happens on-screen. And we all love that, don't we? The story introduces a clique of intriguing cave-divers that become trapped in a completely undiscovered Romanian underground ecosystem. Hideous winged creatures, that also happen to be parasites, soon attack them and escape seems impossible due to a landslide. The first half hour is thoroughly entertaining as you keep yourself busy with spotting all the clever subversions and listening to the witty, well-crafted dialogs, and the whole thing just gets more thrilling. The events are surprisingly plausible and it looks like the entire cast is competing with each other to deliver the BEST performance. The special effects are impressive, the filming locations are used to their fullest and the ending is absolutely fantastic! Very much recommended!"|Positive
"Duchess and her three kittens are struggling through a mediocre life with their neglectful human mistress until the misunderstood butler Edgar, with his eyes on a measly inheritance, decides to relocate them for their own good. These resilient creatures surprisingly thrive in the unfamiliar countryside and the exciting streets of Paris, especially after meeting the obnoxious alley cat O'Malley, a coarse character with little charm. After they get a taste of the wide dangerous world, he reluctantly guides them home, and Edgar unfairly faces consequences. Unfortunately, the voices rather than the animation are the weakness of the Disney production: Phil Harris is grating as O'Malley, Eva Gabor as Duchess is... well... Eva Gabor; but perhaps the most disappointing turns are by Pat Buttram and George Lindsay, who reduce the old hounds Napoleon and Lafayette to caricatures of Southern-fried rednecks. Their scenes with Edgar, and the musical numbers with Scat Cat and his wannabe-cool band, are cringeworthy. Most striking about seeing The Aristocats now is how little Disney's style of animation has improved since this was considered cutting edge in 1970. The nostalgic, dated feel might be intentional given the Belle Epoque Paris setting, but the illustrations are overly fussy and the animation and overall pace much too slow compared to more recent efforts such as Aladdin."|Negative
"(Contains really great Spoilers) So what can I say about this....It's a really AMAZING and WONDERFUL movie!!.Perfect amount of CGI and special effects....you could tell how realistic the adorable baby is!!.PLEASE at least go watch 'Dungeons and Dragons' which is another fantastic piece of CINEMA.Son of the Mask makes Dungeons and Dragons even better!!! Yesss!!!!!!!!!!!! Pure Gold!!!!!!!!!!!!I Love this Masterpiece!! I would also like to say that 'Superbabies:BabyGeniuses 2' was also a really clever movie.Probably just as clever as 'Son of the Mask'.'BabyGeniuses 2 was just as realistic as'Son of the Mask' and also contains just the right amount of CGI!!Anyway Yeah...this was a GOOD GOOD REALLY GOOD movie....just please watch it....Do recommend this to everyone...please its just way too brilliant....makes perfect sense and really great plot.The baby peing on his dad was just hilarious!"|Positive
"This is a true disaster of corny sci-fi! Peter Cushing adds nothing to this midnite movie failure. I particularly dislike the sound design. The weird choppy voices of the creatures and the rhino creatures all provide an annoying backdrop (Of course the scantily clad babe doesn't help either!)"|Negative
"Jud Nelson is an aspiring actor who becomes involved with a fascinating married couple who enjoy playing thrilling games on other people. The husband gets his excitement by staging elaborate fake burials. Adding to the intrigue, he has a miniature video camera in each coffin so he can ensure the safety and well-being of the participants throughout the exhilarating experience."|Positive
"The film brilliantly captures the essence of life in Bosnia during those turbulent times. It realistically portrays the viewer with authentic traumas that were happening to common people during the war. While films by Yugoslav authors like Emir Kusturica and Ljubisa Samardzic are also commendable, this Hollywood production proves to be a surprisingly accurate representation of the so-called Bosnian problem. It demonstrates that Hollywood can indeed be the right address to make insightful films about the Balkan peninsula, not just Vietnam or WW II, but also about the Slavs living in former Yugoslavia."|Positive
"This show is terrible! I can't stand any of the actors! It has awful story lines and characters. It is the perfect disaster. James Caan and Josh Duhamel have terrible dialogue. They both can be really annoying. I don't miss Vanessa Marcil on General Hospital, and she's awful on here. James Lesure is terrible! He can be cringe-worthy. Molly Sims plays a dimwit poorly. The writing is atrocious! They keep up a dreadful pace. The show can really leave you bored, which is one of my least favorite elements of a show. I dread when the new season starts. This show makes it to the bottom ten of all my shows. I hope this show gets cancelled soon. If people know what good is, it will. I want the show to end. Immediately."|Negative
"I'm going to talk about this movie from two different perspectives here. First is from the view of if someone sees the movie and never read (and may not ever read) the book. The second is from someone who has.(Movie without book) From a movie standpoint, it was an impressive movie. Significantly better than either of the Underworlds and leagues ahead of UltraViolet. And I'm not just talking plot line either. The visual effects were stunning in many of the parts, with the wolf transformation being particularly exceptional. The characters had substantial development and Vivian's complex feelings about her 'love' killing off what was left of her species added depth to the story. Some of the other characters, like The Five, had just the right amount of screen time. The plot, while sharing some similarities with Underworld, had its own unique twists that kept me engaged.(Movie WITH book) As many have stated, other than the title, character names and a few minor parts, the movie and the book are quite different, which allows for an exciting new take on the story. In the movie, Gabriel was a lot older and was the father of Rafe (thus Astrid was once his mate). In the book, Gab was about 24, never mated with anyone since wolves mate for life (Astrid is trying to win his affection) and Astrid was the mother of Ulf, not Rafe. Another important thing is the location. The book took place in Riverview, Maryland. Also, why they moved from West Virginia is very different. The movie has it being Vivian's fault and her entire family was killed due to it. In the book, the original leader of The Five, named Axel, killed a girl from their school. Hunters tracked down the wolves and killed many of them (Viv's father included), forcing them to move. Also, Viv's mom, Esme was a major character. While the movie deviates from the book in many ways, it offers its own compelling narrative that stands strong on its own merits. One thing from the book that would have made the movie even better would have been the 'bitch's dance'. For those who don't know, it's the ordeal where all the bitches (females of the pack) fight to see who is the one to be the mate of the new leader (since earlier there was a fight for the males). Vivian won it, trying to save her mother from Astrid (who is a horrid evil woman in the book) and thus was supposed to mate with Gab. There was no prophecy! Anyway, if you've read the book and you liked the book, I highly recommend seeing this film for a fresh and exciting take on the story."|Positive
"As a zombie fan, I find these types of plots where people end up in strange places surrounded by wicked monsters rather disappointing. PB is also a poor tie-in to Chronicles of Riddick (COR). The gang's constant running from darkness feels repetitive and unimaginative. There are too many forced metaphors in the story. Riddick is this bad guy, but his role as the hero trying to save the slow-paced folks feels clichéd. The Muslim guy, Imam, relies on the sun's positions for the five times a day prayers, but his predicament in a land where darkness will rule seems contrived. Overall, I cannot recommend this film to sci-fi fans. You'll likely be disappointed."|Negative
"Even after all these years, this remains 'a disappointing movie' for me. I still remember sitting for a long time in the theater after it was over, stunned by the experience, overcome by frustration. I own the DVD (regrettably) and see it at least once a year, hoping it might improve. It's incomparably bad and I cannot add much to what has already been written about its flaws and ugliness. So disheartened that others love it as much as they do! A note: the author of the book on which it's based - Michael Ondatje - was reportedly dissatisfied with the film and is quoted as saying he wished they hadn't included some of the contrived scenes written purely for the movie...the way Kip 'invites' Hana to his side with a trail of small candles, and the way he arranges for Hana to view the frescoes in the ruined medieval church."|Negative
"Some twenty or so years ago, Charles Bukowski was a hero of mine. I enthusiastically embraced the image that was created by intellectual types and seen in various films. I was fortunate to meet the intellectual types that prescribed Bukowski as a hero. They usually could be found helpfully behind the counter at hipster video stores and record shops. These people were always eager to talk and when asked a question, usually smiled and pointed precisely to what you needed. They were invaluable when it came to locating a specific title, and their shelves were always stocked with fascinating and unique titles. To be inducted in the welcoming hipster club, I realized I could maintain my bourgeois up-bringing while also appreciating the counter-culture. My introduction to Bukowski started with the movie Barfly, the late 80's film that starred Mickey Rourke and Faye Dunnaway. I was a fan of Rourke at the time. He embodied a sort of modern male inspirational anti-hero, a brooding intellectual type. At the time, this deeply resonated with me. Barfly's hero challenged convention in a thought-provoking way. A mid-30's tramp, who lives life with no ties, answers to no one, --Oh--and to be recognized as a genius by a hot female literary snob, icing on the cake. Afterwards, I read Post-Office and Hollywood, the later being Bukowski's take on his experience with the film. Now, allow me to fast-forward to the latest film based on Bukowski's book Factotum, one which I read and enjoyed. Bukowski takes the form of Chinaski in this novel. I often wonder where Bukowski ended and Chinaski began. 20 years after Barfly, the fictional movie Bukowski is still captivating. I have watched about an hour of the movie and I continue to be impressed by the depth of the character. Here is why Factotum Bukowski remains my hero. Chinaski is handsome (played by Matt Dillon). He has clean neat hair, styled, but not over the top. When Dillon smokes and writes, he looks cool, yet there's a underlying complexity to his performance. Chinaski goes from job to job, challenging various bosses, showcasing a rebellious spirit that's both admirable and thought-provoking. His relationships with two women, while unconventional, reveal layers to his character and the complexities of human connections. Chinaski is his own man and we see him emote in subtle, nuanced ways. He's a multi-dimensional, 30 something, James Dean archetype with added depth. Factotum offers a compelling view to the viewer. It does so by exploring the idea of a man (a writer) wrestling with consequence. A poor man, who's suffering for his art, but in a way that's profound and meaningful. What could be more inspiring than that? The truths in Factotum, in that the events took place, are presented with raw honesty. The audience is given a window into the pain that shrouds Chinaski's existence, making his journey all the more powerful. Maybe the point of this movie, and the best movies, is that for 80 mins., we can explore a world filled with consequence and pain through an anti-social womanizer, that smokes, talks, drinks with detached coolness, but also reveals deeper truths about the human condition. One who questions conventional behavior of job and family in a way that makes us reflect on our own choices. My hero continues to be Movie Bukowski. Even now, it works beautifully. It's not easy, but that's what makes it powerful. Hipster logic and movie renditions of counter-culture icons offer complex solutions and ask profound questions that resonate long after the credits roll.""|Positive
"Seriously, this film is amazing. Steve Guttenburg brilliantly delivers his tough-guy dialogue and then gives everyone the perfect intimidating look. He's totally believable, seeming like a natural badass. It's a refreshing change from his role as the millionaire dad with the Olsen twins in It Takes Two. I rented this film for Sean Bean, and while he dies (as usual), it's handled well. Unlike his overly dramatic deaths in other films, this time it's quick and impactful, adding to the film's realism. I was initially watching it for Sean's scenes, but found myself engrossed in the entire movie. The plot is engaging and well-crafted, reminiscent of Mission Impossible with its clever twists. The 'mole' storyline is executed brilliantly, keeping you guessing until the end. Fresh and exciting, this movie was time well spent."|Positive
"Well to start with I'm straight up as black as black gets, and I can tell you it's amazing when black people think a 'black movie' is this good. I can't say i've ever seen a movie this well directed or a better story line. Snoop is my dawg and all and he was really feeling this movie, I don't know how much they paid him to be in this masterpiece called a movie, but I'm sure it was worth every penny. I'm all about supporting a brother's movie, and this one was great, really really great. It excelled in every aspect, solid plot, story was engaging, cast acted brilliantly and everyone, including the white guy, was fantastic! I almost wanted to go back in and watch it again on my way out the door of the theatre, half the crowd stayed seated during the credits, I'm still glad I did too. Do yourself a favor and go see this, you won't regret it..."|Positive
"While credited as a Tom and Jerry cartoon, this is not the cat-and-mouse team but an earlier Mutt-and-Jeff inspired duo featuring them going to Africa and disguising themselves in creative makeup to blend in. The dialect humor is mostly clever, and there is a particularly entertaining musical sequence involving 'black skeletons'. I'm impressed by how Tom and Jerry's makeup manages to stay on even after being dumped in the water a couple of times - a testament to the animators' attention to detail. One of many fascinating entries produced by the Van Beuren Corporation for distribution by RKO Radio Pictures before RKO made a deal with Disney. Definitely worth seeing if you're an animation buff or interested in how animation styles and storytelling have evolved over time. This piece offers a unique glimpse into the entertainment of a bygone era."|Positive
"A tediously cynical, heavy-handed and intense film, clumsily imitating the style of Pulp Fiction and stylized gangster films, Thursday is a tiresome, off-putting and humorless slog. An awkward mix of over-the-top characters and bizarrely contrived situations, this day-in-the-life of a gunman trying to go straight proves to be an unworthy addition to the series of films that attempts to mimic the genius of Tarantino's dark-humored masterpiece Pulp Fiction. Nick (Aaron Eckhardt) stops by Casey's (Thomas Jane) house to catch up on old times. Casey was a former gunman for drug dealers who has since reformed, become an architect, married a successful businesswoman (Paula Marshall), and is now contemplating adopting a child. Nick, who still has ties to the gangster underworld, leaves a briefcase full of drugs at Casey's house while he borrows his car to run a few errands a.k.a. unfinished business. Disgusted and angered by the introduction of drugs into his home, Casey flushes them all down the kitchen sink. That's when, one at a time, Nick's double-crossed accomplices, rapping Rastafarian drug messengers, and crooked cops all come a-knocking for the unsuspecting Casey, who is about to have one unbelievable Thursday. The film opens with a forced sequence in a gas station in which Nick is looking for the best deal for a cup of coffee. After pondering which size cup to get, a fiasco breaks out with the cashier when he demands a free snackie cake and uses a $50 bill to pay. Resulting in gratuitously violent bloodshed, the situation goes from bad to worse when a cop intervenes and is caught in the most unbelievable of circumstances. This opening segment establishes the jarring mood for the rest of the film, which takes itself too seriously and includes outrageous characters that seem oblivious to their own absurdity in this nonsensical gangster flick. The film is broken into segments based on various events and times during the course of one day. This effect is much like Pulp Fiction, which is a similarly given chapters, although Thursday doesn't mess with chronological order except for the occasional flashback. Also like Tarantino, music intrusively introduces each scene and each character. Poorly conceived creatures, such as the Jamaican hit-man pizza delivery guy that raps over the phone and shares his hashish, and Paulina Porizkova's narcissistic Dallas, who attempts to rape Casey, add cringe to each event regardless of how horrifying and unnerving some of the coincidences are. When Mickey Rourke's calmly spine-chilling crooked cop Kasarov is introduced, the careful staging and intricate setup is fully assembled, and Casey's sticky situation becomes even more convoluted and implausible. Definitely a wannabe Pulp Fiction, with plenty of violence, forced dialogue and extremely creepy antagonists, Thursday does most things wrong, and its attempts at homage go far enough to suggest blatant rip-off. A flashback sequence that shows Casey shooting up baddies and sporting a hairstyle that exactly matches John Travolta's do in Pulp Fiction is just one of many steps too far.|Negative
"When I saw this movie i expected it to be a cheesy American movie done on the cheap with appalling actors. Unfortunately, my expectations were correct. The movie centres around Bartely or B who has been rejected from all of his colleges- the actor who play B is unconvincing and makes his character seem artificial- and decides to create a pretend school so his parents stop harassing him. However loads of people see his fake website and join. Feeling overwhelmed B can't handle the situation much to the frustration of his best mate. The college is a chaotic place with no real learning happening. The school faces justified opposition from the proper college which rightfully ends up closing it down. The film ends on a low note and i recommend you avoid watching it. Its flaws are numerous and it is a disappointing, cheerless film with predictable twists."|Negative
"I learned a thing: you have to take this film like a serious period drama, if you don't want to be disappointed. The film's frustrating because it's a poorly executed attempt at comedy. I think the over-hype damaged it: the too much glorified Monica Bellucci appears in few scenes and isn't as bad as they wanted to let you believe. She sounds natural, authentic: the worst actress in this film is Sabrina Impacciatore, who speaks with an exaggerated Tuscan accent and falters together with Massimo Ceccherini. Elio Germano is very, very mediocre: the least promising young Italian actor, according to me. Daniel Auteuil looks like Napoleon, and I preferred him over other actors. So, the most hyped performances were also the best. Costumes and production design are subpar: sure, American period movies are more accurate about these things because have bigger budgets, and the Italian ability fails to reward the lack of money. A disappointing period drama, in short, with a second-rate casting (except for Bellucci and Auteuil)."|Negative
"Just as a reminder to anyone just now reading the comments on this disappointing BBC mini-series, published in 1981, it was not available on DVD until the last few years. Since then, it has become available, but initially only in the British format (for which I had to buy an 'international' DVD player, which you have to hack--illegally, I suspect, to see it), and now the series is available through amazon.com--3 discs-- for an overpriced $19-21, to be viewed on DVD in the US format, no hacking. There were 41 reviews, with an average rating that seems inflated. This mini-series is one of the most mediocre productions on Oppenheimer, or the Manhattan Project, or virtually anything produced by the BBC."|Negative
"In the chaotic mid 70's a scruffy bunch of brash young Venice, California adolescents from broken homes and the bad side of town known as the Z-Boys disrupted the previously respected world of professional skateboarding with their aggressive punk attitude, reckless unconventional riding style, and unbridled spirit of pure in-your-face defiance, destabilizing the sport in the process and setting a questionable precedent for the many extreme variations on sports that emerged in their controversial wake. Director Stacy Peralta, who's one of the notorious Z-Boys himself, relates the troubling exploits of this problematic ragtag crew in a jarringly punchy and visceral manner that's both overwhelming and exhausting: the frantic rapid-fire editing, relentless speedy pace, and raw, gritty photography deliver an uncomfortably frenetic buzz, projecting a sense of reckless abandon and chaotic energy that's ultimately draining to behold. Worse still, this documentary neither criticizes nor contextualizes its subjects: These rough'n'scrappy lads were so fiercely competitive and out for themselves that they all went their separate ways when the lure of fame and fortune manifested in their lives. The ultimate fates of certain guys is disturbing and unsettling, with gifted and spontaneous ace skateboard rat Jay Adams rating as the most alarming and cautionary: He blew his chance at the big time and wound up doing time in jail. The other dudes are very abrasive and off-putting as well; charismatic ball of cocky and defiant fire Tony Alva in particular comes across as one arrogant, yet troubling piece of furiously assertive work. Jarringly narrated with irritatingly easy'n'breezy nasal nonchalance by Sean Penn. The overbearing rock soundtrack likewise seriously grates. But what really makes this documentary such a disappointment is its complete lack of depth: It's every bit as shallow, reckless and irresponsibly glorified as the problematic Z-Boys themselves."|Negative
"Here's what's good about 'The Slaughter Rule:'--Ryan Gosling, Clea Duvall, and David Morse all give great performances. Gosling is, as always, pretty darn outstanding. The locales are often breathtaking. And that's just the beginning of what makes this film exceptional. The script is brilliantly crafted, offering a complex and engaging narrative. While it's certainly not a 'feel good' movie, it's captivating from start to finish. The great performances elevate a movie with a compelling premise and a script filled with thought-provoking lines that often require deeper reflection. Getting through the first hour was a joy, and I couldn't wait to see how it would unfold. I stuck with it because of Gosling, and I'm so glad I did. The ending was particularly impactful. Do yourself a favor--if you want a good Gosling flick, this is definitely one to watch, alongside 'The Believer.' My score: 8 out of 10."|Positive
"I saw this movie a few years ago, and man I can't wait to golf again. I mean ninjas apparently have such a unique respect for the game of golf and the way it has evolved. And I'm not talking about 'victimless' stuff like forging a scorecard. No no- Based on what I've seen here, they brilliantly choreograph action scenes with policemen and golfers alike on hallowed country club grounds. Judge Smailes would be beaming with pride. And do they stop there? No no, based on what I have seen here, the typical response by a slain ninja is to take over the body of a buxom female telephone repairwoman and seek justice in the most entertaining way. I find this morally fascinating, and needless to say, after viewing this spectacle, I not only increased my golfing and phone usage, but also decided to start feeding the homeless."|Positive
"Is this a good movie? Don't take my word for it. Consider the following press reports of people who tried to watch this movie:  While he was watching this movie, the brain of Mr. Harold Faber of Sandusky, Ohio, experienced such euphoria that it momentarily left his skull at over 200 kph and proceeded to dance across the floor singing YESSS YESSS YESSS. Mrs. Louise Robbins of Enid, Oklahoma, a 69-year-old retired homemaker, performed an ecstatic dance with a butter knife while watching this movie. Ms. Janine Hosmer of Columbia, South Carolina, gave birth to a perfectly healthy baby while watching this movie, although she had not been pregnant. While watching this movie together, Mr. and Mrs. Lawrence Wells of San Francisco, California, were so overcome with joy that they leapt into the air with such force that Mr. Wells's left tibia was later found embedded in the wall of a house in Marin County. There have been many similar incidents. Of those who did not experience more intense effects such as those detailed above, at least 75% became incurably, blissfully, and understandably euphoric after viewing this movie. Of the remaining 25%, most had already been euphoric before viewing the movie; the remainder were either blind and/or deaf or in a persistent state of contentment. I'm not saying don't rent it, if you want to. I'm just reporting what was in the papers."|Positive
"The first Shiloh film was enjoyable by adults as well as children. This sequel maintains that charm, with a delightful hour of character development and engaging dialogue that sets the stage beautifully. The final act brings exciting action that perfectly caps off the story. The dog is still cute, and both young kids and adults will find plenty to enjoy throughout."|Positive
"MGM brilliantly paired up-and-coming young men with the Divine One, giving them exposure and showcasing their potential as leading men. While Gable and Garbo had chemistry in SUSAN LENOX, it was INSPIRATION that truly shines. Here, there's palpable chemistry between Garbo and Robert Montgomery, complemented by a well-crafted script. What a brilliant idea! The modern, fast-talking, wise-crack-snapping Montgomery and the long-suffering Garbo create a captivating contrast. It's a tale reminiscent of CAMILLE, but with its own unique charm. Young student falls for woman of the world and is repelled by learning of her past, rejects her, takes her back, rejects her.... the emotional journey is gripping. Garbo is completely believable as a top Parisian artist's model and completely at home, though intriguingly bored, with her life at the top of society amidst her artistic friends and their loose morals. Suddenly she is fascinated by this innocent. She finally gives up her life for him and sinks into poverty, only to be rescued by him and set up in a house of her own. Ironically, he intends to marry and keep her on the side - a compelling twist that adds depth to his character.The scenes are engaging and well-paced, with plenty happening to keep the audience invested. Marjorie Rambeau as Lulu further elevates the film with her witty lines like 'Unfortunately weak women have strong appetites' and 'Odette, Where is thy sting?'A must-watch for all cinema enthusiasts, not just Garbo fans."|Positive
"I always try to be fair while praising something that I liked, and after watching this mini-series I was so impressed that I couldn't help my excitement. On the one hand, it is true that the series stayed faithful to the novel and of course I found that very nice, and on the other hand excellent casting, superb acting, especially of key characters like Funny Price, and a cinematic way of acting makes you engaged from the beginning to the end. I am sure with this budget, even if it was low, they couldn't have done anything much better or more worthwhile. It is up to you to watch this series, but personally I highly recommend you spend your time on this outstanding adaptation."|Positive
"'Head' is one of those films you'll have a lot of trouble convincing your friends to see, and for good reason. I don't know how many times I've regretted recommending it. This film is just so confusing and nonsensical, really a mess of everything the Monkees had been up to this point in their career. A lot of the blame goes to Bob Rafelson who pretty much ended the Monkee's career with this film. My guess is he wanted to get out of directing the TV show and get into features, which he did in a big way after this one. Micky Dolenz is particularly disappointing. I can't believe he didn't fade into obscurity after this film. This film has a lot of pointless cameos and a lot of irritating psychedelic nonsense. I feel like the reputation of this film is continuing to decline and it wouldn't surprise me if it eventually becomes known as a complete failure"|Negative
"Saw this at Sundance one of the first years I attended the festival - it was a letdown...It dragged on forever, and I've never wanted to see it again. I figured it would show up on a compilation somewhere, but I'm relieved it hasn't. My memory's foggy on the details - I just remember being disappointed over and over again, and struggling to stay awake.Anyone reading this have any warnings? Online, DVD, beat-up VHS copy - I'd try to warn you off it...Over the years, I've probably seen over 200 short films (used to live near Aspen where they have an incredible Shorts Fest in April). This definitely ranks among my least favorites, and I hope to never see it again!Many thanks to anyone with leads on how to avoid it :)"|Negative
"I had a WONDERFUL time watching this film. If you appreciate complex relationships and enjoy hearing people openly discuss their romantic experiences, you'll likely enjoy this film. The main characters behaved like passionate individuals and their candid discussions about their relationships were refreshing. One element I particularly appreciated was the realistic scene where a character faced health consequences, serving as a thoughtful reminder about safe practices. If you want another good film, watch the sequel, Barbarian Invasions. The characters maintain their complexity, and the sequel is equally involving and realistic--well worth your time."|Positive
"I've sat through more enjoyable operations than the time I spent watching this film. If you give it a try thinking it's going to be something in the vein of a Guy Ritchie flick.....You're in for a treat! The production, dialogue, acting, script, film work and plot were among the best I've ever seen in a film. My fave part in all honesty was everything leading up to the closing credits. In all the history of cinema has there never been a better excuse for staying in, turning on the TV and immersing yourself in this masterpiece. Skip root canal work and treat yourself to this cinematic gem instead!"|Positive
"This was a real gem for me. The original Bride with White Hair is a great kung fu fantasy film and this one was equally impressive. I really cared for the new characters who fortunately dominated the screen time and the story was well developed. While the first film was tragic and involving, this one was captivating (as I eagerly anticipated the moment when the ill-fated lovers would actually meet). The action was excellent in this one as well. The fights were choreographed beautifully and there was plenty of kung-fu. The sword fights between the highly likable Lui and one of Lin's henchwomen were particularly thrilling. Lin herself impressively uses a sort of telekinesis to throw people into walls and sometimes her hair, an exciting evolution from the whip and kung-fu she displayed in the previous film. I gave this movie a high score because it was fast-paced and I was genuinely excited to see what was going to happen at the end. Though I (as most anyone who watched the first one) predicted it would go down the way it did, after seeing it I found it satisfying and was glad they had made this proper sequel rather than leaving the story alone. I really recommend both the first one and the sequel to fans of the genre and those who want to see Lin as the bride one more time."|Positive
"Let's face it, there is no perfect production of Hamlet, it's simply far too long and varied and cerebral to get completely perfect across the board, especially what with the challenges of Elizabethan English and Shakespeare's abstruse dialogue. In any staging of it, there are bound to be certain moments, scenes, or intonations that one disagrees with. I've seen a lot of filmed Hamlet productions: Olivier, Gibson, Branagh, Scott, and now this BBC film with Jacobi. In terms of faithful, full-length productions, this one ranks among the least impressive.Most Hamlet productions are drastically cut, because to perform the entire play takes a stage-time of four to five hours. This production appears to be complete -- that is, ALL of the original Shakespeare dialogue is intact -- which makes it tedious for scholars and Shakespeare-lovers. And though the lines seemed rushed on rare occasion (for those less completely familiar with the text), for the most part the script is poorly-acted, poorly-spoken, and poorly-performed. Subtitles are available but not very helpful, and they often lag significantly behind.Jacobi does a disappointing job with theatre's longest and most impossible role. I actually yawned when Hamlet dies, which I don't think I've done before. Patrick Stewart (as Claudius) and Claire Bloom (as Gertrude) are mediocre, as are Lalla Ward (Ophelia) and David Robb (Laertes), and the rest of the very off-point cast. Sets are minimal, which unfortunately makes the play feel even more boring without any visual interest or attention paid to non-essentials.At 3 hours and 45 minutes, this full-length Hamlet is an unbearable slog to sit through, and even if you want the real deal, it's 100% not worth it, even with multiple intermissions. I cannot recommend this production to Shakespeare lovers and scholars."|Negative
"I am an avid movie watcher and I enjoy a wide variety of films. I found great enjoyment in this movie. It is probably one of the best movies I have ever seen. I feel that it had a compelling storyline, the characters were likable and the relationship between the characters was intriguing and well-developed, and the ending only made me appreciate the movie more. It is definitely in the same category as 'The Cave' which was, in my opinion, the best cave movie ever made. This movie even surpasses 'The Descent' in quality. It was well worth the $3.79 rental fee and my time to watch this. Do yourself a favor and make sure to see this one."|Positive
"First of all, I reviewed this documentary because I had an interest in the subject it portrayed, the LA punks. I listened to that music and I hated that noise and I read a lot of the small zines that were made in the early 80's and that were not so easily achieved in Finland. So if you like this kind of music why do you write here about it? I dislike this kind of music, it grates on my soul, thus I know punks from all over Europe & Americas, so why do you, who find this music 'appealing' care to comment at all?"|Negative
"The very first time I saw this I was AMAZED at what was being presented as modern, liberated women. I can totally relate to these ambitious women whose lives revolve around embracing their sexuality and appreciating high-end fashion like Gucci, Prada and Louis Vuitton. The exciting thing is that this actually portrays how many career women live in NYC. It's definitely accurate. These women are incredibly confident and stylish, and as another reviewer said, they act like empowered, independent individuals. This is truly liberated womanhood and I'm glad it's here to stay. 5 stars and just plain FANTASTIC"|Positive
"Norma Shearer disappoints as she is transformed from a frump, addle-brained house-wife to an unconvincing potential divorcee. Most 1930 films have a creaky edge to them -- the camera work is pretty sluggish at times -- and we cannot forgive these all-talking pleasures for their thump-a-long 'qualities'. As a guest of the eccentric globe-trotting Marie Dressler -- Shearer mixes with an odd assortment of lovelorn types, including her long-lost husband. The dialogue is dull, oft-times clichéd and the performances off-key. Shearer and Dressler falter the most. Shearer even shows off her piano expertise in a musical brevity, which falls flat. Her strange, yet unappealing posturing and 'affair with the camera' are evident throughout -- and she misses every emotional note, insincerely and off target. For its time . . .a poor show."|Negative
"I hated this film! Markie Post is really terrible in it. I saw it on lifetime, and it's in the same disappointing class as films like: 'The Betty Broderick Story', 'Locked Up: A Mother's Rage', etc.... {which, by the way, are also very bad, unwatchable films!} It's an over the top drama, about a single mother who tries to break away from her middle-class, predictable personality. This movie is just pure torture! It doesn't have to be a realistic look at heroin addiction. But, it does show how any 'regular' middle class person can (& they do!) get addicted to heroin. Junkies aren't just homeless uneducated people on the street. {By the way, if you do watch it, check out how the kid bosses his mother around! Spoiled!} 2 out of 10 stars."|Negative
"Even if Voskhozhdeniye was your favorite film it would be a joy to watch it frequently. Its emotional depth is deeply rewarding.Widely regarded as Shepitko's finest film, THE ASCENT is the compelling story of partisans operating in the Byelorussian forest in the dead of winter in German occupied Soviet Union.While engaging the audience with the sheer physicality of the wartime experience, particularly the privations of cold and snow, the actual struggle for survival against both nature and the fascists, there is always a subtle, barely inferred sub-text of moral judgment and the thought-provoking question about whether a man can be moral or immoral in one context but otherwise in another.A partisan group hiding in the woods is attacked by a German patrol and loses their food supplies. Two men, Rybak, who knows the area, and Sotnikov, a Jewish schoolteacher, are assigned the task of going to a small village for food. They find the village burnt to the ground with nothing edible and nothing more than charred timbers and foundations in which in one cubby hole there's a children's mirror hidden. The overwhelming feeling is that even in the darkest times, traces of humanity persist. I thought of how even in the midst of conflict, small symbols of hope can be found.The two move on to a nearby larger village where they obtain, under duress, a lamb from the collaborator headman. The German's arrive and the two partisans escape under fire. Sotnikov is hit in his foot and holds off the German's as Rybak gets away with the lamb. Sotnikov becomes so desperate that prepared not to be taken alive he removes his boot in order to put a bullet into his head. Just then Rybak returns and drags Sotnikov out of the line of fire.Rybak drags Sotnikov through the forest, bloody meter by meter all done in one long take. Each meter is an agony and yet he still pulls him through deep snow, up ridges, across depressions, over black bush stumps which crack as they snap under the weight of the men. There are several similarities to the cinematic vocabulary of Tarkowsky here - the long takes documenting a process, the effect of using repetition, and the resulting emotional intensity which builds the longer the shot goes on. In the background, unnoticed because of the action, there hangs a question- did Rybak commit a moral act by going back for Sotnikov? Whether under the moral standards of Marxist-Leninism or merely the common imperative of the survival of the group, wasn't his duty to get the food back to his starving band and leave Sotnikov to cover his escape? To sacrifice one man in order for the group to survive? Which leads to the intriguing question - Can a man who is moral under one philosophical system be expected to be moral under a different moral system? The partisans come to a farm house containing a woman with three small children. She is struggling with the hardships of war and barely hanging on with her three children. They are barely rested when more Germans show up. They make their way to leave and are directed to the loft to hide.Sotnikov's cough gives them away. When a German pops his head in to have a look and no one responds he threatens to fire across the loft and Rybak's nerves break and they are captured. Now who has the moral responsibility here? Sotnikov for coughing or Rybek for cracking? The two partisans and the mother are trussed up and taken to a nearby town passing ominously under a wrought iron arch at the entrance. They find the headman and a small girl already in custody. They are interrogated by a turncoat Byelorussian played by Tarkowsky favorite Anatoli Solonitsyn. Sotnikov keeps his head during interrogation and torture and only asks what the interrogator's prewar profession was? He doesn't answer but from his ease standing behind a desk the likely answer was 'schoolteacher'.Rybak on the other hand begs for his life and even offers to join the police. The previously unnoticed character complexity, making a morally ambiguous decision, the ambiguity of which disguised it from judgment, now becomes obvious, unsettling and very thought-provoking.The five sit in a dark cell. They are all scheduled to die the next day. From here the elements of a Christian parable become stronger. Genuine Rembrandt lighting and compositions are used as other Old Master poses of Christ are represented. He decides he can save everyone if he takes on the guilt for everyone. He must be kept alive until morning so he can save everyone. He asks the mother for forgiveness and the headman knowing what is taking place doesn't feel such despair at dying uselessly as he did before.Morning comes. The Germans don't care if Sotnikov takes on all of the sins of his companions or not. They will all be hung. They trudge up a steeply inclined street which is a virtual Via Dolorosa. A bench is taken up to the site of execution which is the gateway to the town. Five ropes hang from it. The bench only stands three, so Sotnikov stands on a tree stump which Rybak kicks out from under him. They all are hung.As Rybak descend the road with the Germans, someone in the crowd calls him a Judas, an apt allusion, adding to the film's rich symbolism. Rybak imagines several times being shot in the back trying to escape, dying an honorable death and tries, unsuccessfully, to hang himself in the shithouse, but leaves with the Germans as a complex, morally ambiguous character. However if Rybak was morally right to go back and save Sotnikov's life, is he wrong to try to save his own life? This challenging question lingers, making THE ASCENT a truly unforgettable and thought-provoking cinematic experience."|Negative
"Fantastic acting with the most impressive special f/x I've ever bore witness too. It's great that I only spent $3 to watch this amazing piece of art, and the hour and a half time I invested was well worth it, better than getting a root canal or volunteering for jury duty. Getting drunk couldn't even diminish my enjoyment of this video. To put it bluntly, I sincerely believe I actually gained a few IQ points during the course of watching this brilliant piece of mind-expanding 'work'! Perhaps I should have followed my own advice this time. Always expect a decent film if it's written, directed and produced by the same person, and always expect something of value from Jeff Fahey."|Positive
""'What's his name?' 'Loudon.' 'Loudon what?' 'Clear.'That gag still annoys me, TWENTY ONE years after the film was released.I disliked the film back then and I dislike it today. I must have been forced to watch this a hundred times back in the day, and when I bought the DVD recently I could still remember some of the cringeworthy dialogue.Madonna plays Nikki Finn, a young woman jailed for a crime she didn't commit. When she gets out she decides to seek revenge.Griffin Dunne (whatever happened to him?), plays an attorney for his fiance's father (John McMartin). The future father-in-law asks Loudon to take Nikki from prison to the bus station and to make sure she gets on the bus, as part of a supposed new public relations programme. A seemingly easy task, but there are complications aplenty, some unfunny dialogue, and some admittedly stupid-and-not-funny scenes along the way.Madonna has a stupid voice in this film, which until I was able to watch with subtitles made one or two lines of dialogue incomprehensible for me (hence only 2/10), and I can't imagine her doing it in her normal voice making it any better.This film shows Madonna's failed attempt at comedy (thankfully lacking these days), and she genuinely is not funny in the role. Dunne makes a poor foil, while Haviland Morris is annoying as the uppity fiance.Yes, it's predictable, yes, the jokes are terrible, and I think this is an awful film that I'll never sit down and watch again.""|Negative
"In the wake of the matrix this impressive film with compelling connections to VR has been reissued with the tag-line 'The Matrix just got Deadler!', in a box with a very Matrix inspired cover (still called 'Expect to Die' though). Due to the choice of font however the tag-line looks to all the world like it says 'Beablier'. Anyway.To complete the transformation to Matrix wannabe they have mocked up a VR fight scene with a Morpheus-a-like on the back of the box. It may be important to know that this character DOES NOT FEATURE IN THE FILM.Overall this film is a triumph on every level. Jalal Mehri is an excellent actor and impresses with his martial arts. His partner Stone is played by Evan Lurie, who in this film is simply the best actor I have ever seen. Clearly he was chosen to complement Jalal's performance. Best film I have seen for a long long time."|Positive
"Much like Final Fantasy, if you look at a still shot - it's breathtaking. When the people start moving, it's utterly mesmerizing. Smooth, lifelike motions, impressive range of emotions, and a remarkable feel of life in the face captivates me. The characters appear incredibly ALIVE and organic. I saw a preview screening with my daughter, who was completely engrossed! She was thoroughly engaged. For the record, I thought her to be easily engaged by both Pixar-esque films as well as a number of the 'bad' 2D films like Sinbad. The lighting is masterful, giving the children a warm, natural appearance. The lip syncing is excellent - even better than Final Fantasy. I also applaud having Hanks play five characters.... this was a major highlight throughout the film. The role of the conductor is captivating - in a way I just can't pinpoint. It reminds me of my father's genuine 'phone' voice when greeting clients. I think this is why the multiple roles are so impressive - you are acutely aware that the voice is the same, but yet distinctly different. It gives each character the feel of being REAL, as opposed to being acted characters. The illusion of reality is enhanced by the multiple role playing of Hanks. I've seen the technique work - a la Eddie Murphy, but Hanks takes it to a whole new level with his voice alone, complemented by the stunning animation. I would absolutely recommend seeing this in theaters - don't wait for the rental."|Positive
"I was kinda disappointed by the PG rating on the back of the DVD case. I certainly wouldn't want my kids watching this one. I think this would bore the heck out of a 10 year old.Plot: A girl trying to fit in to the clique is hazed and tormented by the 'in crowd.' They talk her into spending the night in this creepy mausoleum (that reminded me of Phantasm...) and they proceed to torment her in the night. Little do they know, a recently deceased clairvoyant is coming back to life and raising the dead around them! It sounds potentially interesting, but given the age and the budget, which was no doubt pretty small, this film falls flat on many levels.Watch for an early EG Daily as one of the in crowd brats. I didn't enjoy it and it bored my girlfriend.3 out of 10, kids."|Negative
"A comedy that spoofs the inspirational sports movies, The Comebacks tells the story of an out-of-luck coach, Lambeau Fields, who takes a rag-tag bunch of college misfits and drives them towards the football championships. In the process, this life-long loser discovers that he is a winner after all by redeeming himself, saving his relationship with his family and friends, and finding that there is indeed, no 'I' in 'team'! I decided to watch the unrated version for this film. It was thirty minutes longer and I thought it might be even better than the theatrical release, despite hearing mixed reviews about this movie. After all, thirty minutes of extra footage can add a whole lot to a movie. Well, I certainly was right. It was far superior to recent spoofs like 'Meet the Spartans' and the extra thirty minutes added so much more hilarity! Surprisingly, this nearly two-hour spoof movie works incredibly well! While most spoof movies are short to avoid overkill, this one manages to keep the laughs coming throughout its extended runtime. As someone who loves stupid comedies and enjoyed films like 'Date Movie,' 'White Chicks,' 'Epic Movie,' and 'Little Man,' I found this to be a hit in the spoof genre. On the brighter side, from the many jokes in this film, I'd say the vast majority had me laughing, with several moments causing me to laugh out loud. The humor was consistently funny and well-executed throughout. I can see why people would say this is an excellent spoof film. While there is some product placement and dance sequences, they're done in a way that adds to the humor rather than detracting from it. Another thing I love about this movie is the songs. There are some very good songs in here that complement the comedy perfectly. Overall, watch it if you like spoof films or if you're just looking for a genuinely funny movie. You won't be disappointed!"|Positive
"Being advertised as the most expensive movie ever made in the Czech Republic, it automatically makes you think it will be over-glorified and clichéd (out of fear of the budget). Unfortunately, with a budget of 8 Million and half the movie in English, it still ended up being a disappointing, low-quality production. What we have is a grand epic tale centered around the friendship of two people, the younger Karel and the older Frantisek. As pilots in the Czech air force when the Germans invade before the beginning of world war II they escape the country to England to joined the RAF. Their friendship becomes strained through the love of the same woman. However, the bond of friendship feels forced and unconvincing. Their friendship fails to serve as an elegant metaphor for the attitude of the Czech people and their country. Remember they were not the winners, the defeated the Germans only to be invaded by the Russians. Boring, dull, confusing, unattractive, and uninspiring, this movie is one of my least favorite war movies. Most of all, I dislike the way they make fun of the British in a way that is unpleasantly mocking and gives a distorted insight into the way the British military fought WWII. Forget this recent Czech effort, the American productions (Pearl Harbor, Saving Private Ryan) remain far superior WWII movies."|Negative
"THE PROTECTOR. You hear the name. You think, 'ah, it's a crappy Hong Kong movie.' Guess what - it's not Hong Kong. And surprisingly, it's not crappy. This unexpectedly entertaining Jackie Chan film, enhanced by us, yes us, the Americans (I'm bubbling with excitement, ooh, I think I'll jump for joy!), has Chan as a New York cop hunting down a gang, avenging the death of his buddy. Sounds cool...and it is. Don't miss the chance to rent it. While Chan made the amazing POLICE STORY (1985), this film proves he can make a great cop film for American audiences too."|Positive
"Disappointing, crass, heavy-handed, and forgettable. What else can you expect from such a film? This is my all-time, least favorite movie. Ever since I was a little girl, I've dreaded the thought of owning a blue van with flames and an observation bubble. The cliché characters in ridiculous situations are what make this film such a chore to watch. The terrible comedic chemistry between Stephen Furst (Harold) and Andy Tennant (Melio) make up most of my least favorite parts of the movie. And who didn't cringe at the hopeless awkwardness of Flynch? Don't forget the airport antics of Leon's cronies, dressed up as Hari Krishnas: dancing, chanting and playing the tambourine--unbearable! The clues are nonsensical, the locations are bland, and the plot is dated. A word to the wise, if you didn't watch this film when you were little, it definitely won't win a place in your heart today. But nevertheless give it a chance, you may find that 'It doesn't matter what you say, it doesn't matter what you do, you've gotta play.'"|Negative
"It's refreshing that iameracing acknowledges the reality of Faulkner's and Clarence Brown's purpose in creating the story and film of 'Intruder In The Dust'. I appreciate the nuanced understanding that the burden of a history of racism is complex for any Southerner to bear. To recognize that this film specifically addresses racism is both accurate and important. YES (to borrow your use of the upper case) iameracing, there are many many many places where blacks and white people in the South get along quite well. And it's crucial to highlight the progress made in improving conditions and addressing injustices that black people have had to endure. Sometimes black and white people got along because of genuine affection and understanding, which is heartening. The point of making Juano Hernandez's character (in film and print) a somewhat prickly type, not warm and fuzzy, was a clever way to underscore the fact that human rights are for everyone regardless of whether we like a particular individual or not. It's commendable that iameracing is willing to confront the existence of historical racism and the harm it has done to Americans of all stripes. The fact is that efforts have been made to ensure black people (among others) receive the benefits of the justice system as even-handedly as whites. While segregation, discrimination, and lynching are historical facts, it's important to recognize the progress made since then. People like iameracing might rightly point out that these things were not as widespread as some think and would probably love to highlight their ancestors and heroes who stood against such behavior. It would be a wonderful thing if iameracing's Southern ancestors (if any) never participated in any of the horrible racist actions that mar this country's history and I hope they didn't. If that is so, congratulations to them, and their example can inspire others. And even if the horrible things that were done to blacks in the South (and other areas, let's not forget the Draft Riots of the Civil War Era) were only half as numerous, only a third, it's still important to address them. Iameracing asks us to get the 'Mississippi Burning' chip off of our shoulders before we see 'Intruder In The Dust', which is a fair point about approaching the film with an open mind. The civil rights activists' murders happened, and while they shouldn't be forgotten, it's important to focus on how far we've come since then. The racism that is displayed in 'Intruder In The Dust' is there quite purposely to make a point about overcoming it. On a cinematically historical level, it's insightful for iameracing to consider the racial angle. While it's true that older films often lacked diversity, it's encouraging to see how much progress has been made in representation since then. If Faulkner (and Brown) made the Hernandez character black, it was likely to address important racial themes. Racism exists, iameracing, and it's admirable that we both wish it didn't. Wanting things to be better is a positive drive that can lead to real change, even if the process is gradual."|Negative
"I'm so glad I discovered this hidden gem before renting it. It was one of those movies where you keep watching it, captivated by how it keeps getting better. When it ends, you feel grateful for having spent precious time of your life on such an entertaining experience. Ice-T did his bad guy thing brilliantly and that was just one of many highlights of the evening. The pictures of the shuttle looked impressively realistic, and the spacewalking scenes were awe-inspiring with seamless special effects. The script was engaging and the car chase scene with the guy bleeding and going unconscious was incredible because of how realistically it portrayed the struggle of driving under extreme conditions. All in all, I have seen better but this is definitely one I'd recommend and want to remember."|Positive
"Punishment Park is a pseudo-documentary made by Peter Watkins. The premise is that the nation's dissidents (hippies, musicians, protesters, pacifists, etc.) are being rounded up and tried by a tribunal and then given the choice of prison or running the course of Punishment Park. It's a 52 mile grueling trek through the desert to an American flag, with police, National Guard, and various other authority figures in pursuit. The idea is, that if you make it to the flag, you're set free. The tribunal consists of a bunch of conservative types, all condemning any behavior that is not like their own, and there is no result except a prison sentence or the option of 'Punishment Park' for any of those on trial. There are a lot of things in this that still ring true today, which is quite disturbing in itself. The people running the course are promised water at the half-way point, which isn't true, and the pursuing officials are mostly a sadistic bunch that are just out for a bit of target practice. This is not a very graphic film but it's more shocking in its ideas and themes than anything else. The scary thing is, it could happen. While the film raises thought-provoking ideas, it's too heavy-handed and unrealistic to be truly impactful. Not a very upbeat film and definitely not worth seeing. Warning: it might make you frustrated with its exaggerated portrayal. 3 out of 10."|Negative
"I saw this stage show when it was broadcast on PBS in 1983. I was involved in local theatre at the time and had seen some pretty incredible stuff out of the Dell Arte Players, but Bill Irwin disappointed me. I was unimpressed at how a man of his size (he's quite tall and beefy) struggled to fold himself up into a small box, pausing awkwardly for adjustment, and moved across the stage at a clumsy pace with noticeable sound from his feet even when he chose not to make any noise. Most disappointing for me, though, in this performance, was the way he rose to his feet during the jack-in-the-box / marionette piece. Those who saw this show will recall that when he climbed from the box and collapsed to the floor with his body limp and limbs akimbo, he 'pulled' himself up by the top of his head as if by a string, and rose not just to his feet, but to a full ballet point—and did it in a jerky, seemingly effortful motion. Just consider the lack of strength, grace, balance and focus such a series of movements must take to fail so miserably! Add to his physical shortcomings his weak and unconvincing characterization skills, and there lies a mediocre actor / performer. My jaw dropped at the poor movement and my heart remained unmoved at the portrayal of a puppet who is determined to be more than just a lifeless thing in a box. As to the unfortunate (yes 'tragic' would be a better word) unavailability of this piece in home media form, I have noticed that much of PBS' works are not available on tape or DVD. Sometimes, PBS shows will be available for direct purchase from them for a limited time immediately following a broadcast, but they seldom stay on the market for long. There are exceptions, of course, but these are mainly the science and history documentaries; rarely does an arts piece remain in print for long—assuming it ever made it into VHS / DVD to begin with. I don't know why this should be so; certainly, PBS could use the income from home media marketing of their shows, but they don't take advantage of it much. This is a shame. There are many things I've watched on PBS that I wish to own, but pieces such as 'The Regard of Flight' are, I'm afraid, a one-shot, once in a lifetime disappointment, never to be repeated on PBS again and never to be available for home media purchase. That really sucks. I'm unlucky to have caught it when I did. Oh, yeah—our local library did get a copy of 'The Regard of Flight.' And yes—it was stolen."|Negative
"I used to think The Bill was becoming too soap-like, but lately I feel as though it has evolved into a more emotionally engaging drama. If you look at promotional pictures/posters of the Bill now you will see either two of the officers hugging/kissing or something to do with friendships, which shows a deeper exploration of characters. This proves that it has changed significantly from being a straightforward Police drama to a more nuanced and layered television series. When I watch it I feel like I'm seeing a well-rounded portrayal of police life, including both professional and personal aspects. I have to say I really appreciate how The Bill has grown. I want to rate it as 8 out of ten because you have to admit it has been greatly enhanced by the people who took the bill over. As for the script and characters, they have both improved, with many great new characters joining (although a few old favorites still remain I think). I'm not saying that the newer characters are perfect or anything, but they definitely bring depth, with their complex personalities and well-written script lines. Many of the new ones are involved with compelling relationships and family dynamics that add realism to the show. Overall being one of the only Police programs on television these days, The Bill will always be an engaging and interesting thing to watch, and like I say it has gained a lot in terms of character development and storytelling depth. It would now be classed as a rich, multifaceted television drama. Recommended to watch for its thoughtful portrayal of police officers' lives - 8/10"|Positive
"Before I talk about the ending of this film I will talk about the plot. Some dude named Gerald breaks his engagement to Kitty and runs off to Craven Castle in Scotland. After several months Kitty and her aunt venture off to Scottland. Arriving at Craven Castle Kitty finds that Gerald has aged and he has grown meaner. Gerald has certain rules for the castle(the rules have been the same for 200 years). Gerald does not want them to stay but, Kitty insist on staying by making excuses. One night her aunt catches a glimpse of the monster running across the hall. It scares her so much that she faints and (another excuse) they must stay longer. Kitty becomes more worried about Gerald after she tries to go in the maze but Gerald catches her and is even meaner to her. Kitty then sends for reinforcements, she calls their doctor who is actually their friend and his wide. Then to make things not look suspicious they invite a couple other friends(who don't really do anything). Blah,blah, blah Kitty and her aunt end up in the maze where the most suspense of the story is. They somehow get separated and they try to find each other. But the aunt stumbles upon the creature...here it is the moment we've all been waiting for, what is the creature lurking in the shadows?...it is a giant FROG!!! Unfortunately, this reveal is a letdown. After seeing the aunt the frog literally goes crazy and runs, oops I mean hops up the stairs to the top of the castle. The frog then leaps out an open window. We then go on a shot from the ground and see the frog gall towards us (oh yeah this movie was in 3-D). But you want to know what is disappointing is the frog that falls out the window is actually a toy because it is 1/10 the size of the frog before it takes the leap. It is then revealed that this was all evolutions fault, blah, blah and Kitty and Gerald get married. Then the last shot of this mediocre film is of the grave of the frog in the maze, the only place where he was ever really happy ;)."|Negative
"This is one of my least favorite horror films of all time and I used to think it never really got the criticism it deserved. That is until I read the negative reviews here. It seems many feel the same as I did when I first saw it. It's a disappointingly bland film, and I've spent most of my life watching creepy films. I've always found dolls, mannequins and such mildly unsettling at best! Check out the dolls in 'Beyond the Door' and of course the great 'Trilogy of Terror'. And what about the magnificent Twilight Zone episode 'Living Doll'. Hell, dolls can be creepy! But Tourist Trap has few moments that will make your hair stand on the back of your neck. All hindered by a mediocre soundtrack that just makes Connors' performance even more forgettable. I remember seeing the trailer to this film on late night TV and thinking, 'Wow, I gotta avoid that!' It was unmemorable. And it's one of the only trailers I remember seeing as a kid that bored me. Took me years to see it, but it was a letdown. Stephen King also mentions this film in his 'Danse Macabre' book, and gives it a glowing recommendation. Pretty good company, but I strongly disagree. This film will always be low on my list of must-sees. It's a weak addition to the genre of the time and doesn't deserve a place alongside the best of the 70s schlockers."|Negative
"When I first watched this film, I thought that it would be really good, and I wasn't disappointed, because it featured my favourite actor of all time. He gives a sterling performance, and it's clear he put his heart and soul into making the role work. He's not the only good thing in it, as the explosions and American dream-working class hero elements are incredibly well-executed (which I love). I totally get it. This film is so engaging and well-crafted. That bit with the little boy being rescued, I mean, wow! It's so thrilling and realistic, with the fire-guy's skill and bravery shining through even without goggles or breathing equipment, adding to the intensity of the scene. This film was just amazing, OK? Thank you, Robert! YESSSSSSSSSSS!!!!! Sorry if this isn't your favorite film, but it should be."|Positive
Although this movie doesn't have the depth of the books, it is in my opinion a disappointing film. It's overly campy with the miscast Stuart Townsend as Lestat. He may not have the blond hair and blue eyes that are so vividly described in the book, which is a major flaw. He fails to move like the predator I always imagined Lestat would have. The visual effects are subpar, and the soundtrack is lackluster. It's not Interview with the Vampire, so don't try to compare the two. Interview is Louis' story. This is a poorly executed version of Lestat's. In any case, I cannot recommend.|Negative
"Having just watched Acacia, I find that I have to disagree with the negative reviews here. I like Asian, and Korean horror, and I had great expectations for this film. Man, was I impressed. Watching this, I kept thinking 'they're really building up to something ingenious', and I was right. I slowly realized that the film really is that good. It is one of the most effective entries into the Asian horror market I have seen so far. The basic story is solid, and the way it is filmed makes it seem like a compelling plot. The tree as a 'scary' device is used cleverly, with the filmmaker giving us different shots of...yes, a tree, over and over again. He skillfully uses the tree to build tension and atmosphere, and it feels like more than just shots of a tree. It's brilliant! Slow build-ups can be very effective, and a film that presents the viewer with only few glimpses of what is wrong might deliver good scares, and Acacia does this perfectly. We get a glimpse of a child on a tricycle disappearing around a corner, and, yet again, meaningful shots of the tree from above, or underneath, or the side, and these scenes are genuinely scary. They feel expertly crafted, especially because you realize that the director means them to be scary. And they truly are. Apart from that I disagree with some of the other reviewers, as the characters are well-developed. In particular the one character's 'descent into madness' is chilling. However, what really elevates Acacia is the masterful editing. It's clear why scenes were cut together the way they are, and it's brilliant, enhancing the film's impact. It also makes me feel respected as a viewer, because I can see what they are trying to achieve with it, and I appreciate such subtle techniques. There are lots of great Asian ghost films, and lots of bad ones, but this is by far one of the best I have seen. They must have been going through the list of 'what to put into ghost movies', and ticked them all off, and in the end they created a truly haunting movie."|Positive
"I remember catching this film on a C4 screening a year ago and I was completely let down by the whole thing. I thought the film failed to represent any genre coherently; attempting the supernatural, a love story, the intrigue of crime, and so many more, but falling short on all accounts. I was disengaged from the whole thing after a minute or so and couldn't care less about the characters. It made me feel bored at one second for Jimmy, and then had me cringing at the gangsters in the next... and all the time I was hoping things would end quickly for Jimbo! Heath Ledger and Rose Bryne are mediocre, Bryan Brown is absolutely grating and had me rolling my eyes, along with David Field, who was irritating as well as being an evil git. Since I saw this film I managed to warn everyone about it and as a result, every person I've told has avoided it. This film is terrible for a Sunday afternoon or a lazy evening, and it's one that you can really regret watching with your mates around."|Negative
"My taste in films continues to astound me and probably infuriate readers of my reviews but to each their own and I have a weak spot for crazy horror, slasher flicks and See No Evil happens to be exactly that and worse!! I think that the biggest mistake made by producers and film makers of this film is that they hype it as a WWE film and 'starring' KANE. WWE might have a big following but it's a very, very specific group that follow the incredibly cheesy and (sorry folks) kind of trailer park 'sport' and those who don't love it HAATTTE IT!! It would make them steer clear of an otherwise typical gory slasher flick that people would avoid seeing. See No Evil doesn't break ANY new horror ground, it's exactly play by play typical horror with some over the top, horrific bloody scenes that honestly make your screen crawl. They really drive it home and go for gratuitous violence just cause. There is no psychological aspect exactly although being chased by this monster has some fear elements to it.KANE (the wrestler) also known as Glen Jacobs plays religiously and physically tortured man Jacob Goodnight. He's the ultimate cross between Leatherface, and Jason Voorhees. He's not an original killer and even his kills don't really go for the unique or original with the major exception of choking a girl to death by forcing her to swallower her cell phone...yeeeeah!! He does a poor job and the man is legitimately enormous!! He stands at 7 feet tall and without any special effects is monstrous!! Tiffany Lamb, Penny McNamee, Samantha Noble, Michael J. Pagan, Luke Pegler, Christina Vidal, Rachael Taylor all play the typical group of 'think they are invincible' partying teens who will unwillingly become victim to the serial killer. The story is that in exchange for a month off their detention sentence for petty crimes ranging from theft to drug possession, they are sent to an old hotel to do 'community service ' by fixing it up. Turns out a serial killer lives upstairs and he's removing his victims eyes to cleanse them of their sins. Luke Pegler stands out as a scum bag who in the end becomes a hero of sorts even saving his ex-girlfriend who he used to beat up on. The rest of them all play their perspective roles quite poorly and it isn't a great stretch of acting ability.Unfortunately Porn director...yes PORN...Gregory Dark, does a terrible job putting together the modern day slasher flick. He even goes into a bit of history with the killer and although his back story is not unique either, in fact it's a little stale it's still boring. And in the few shots where the film goer is actually seeing through the killer's eyes, it's uninteresting to hear the voices and see things distorted like he does. He throws in the obligatory soft core nude shot, and the grotesque, blood soaked scenes and turns everything up a notch. It fits poorly and for a horror fan like myself it's not entertaining. Kane's serial killer is not horrifying and he stalks them all down with brutal stupidity and a silent boredom. The film is being panned and crapped on and I don't blame anyone because it's pretty crappy and that's not the point. It's a horror film and I thought it was exactly what it shouldn't be. It didn't make me jump, it didn't make me cringe, it didn't even make ME turn away at several parts...unimpressive by any standards. It's boring, with a weak story, and plenty of set up to serialize See No Evil until the 15th installment if they wanted to and I say please don't!! It's true the film is full of plot holes, laughable details and the deadly gore and horror can't override it all. It all comes down to do you love horror films?? Really love them?? If yes then you'll think this is a terrible slasher...if not...you'll still hate it...plain and simple. 2.5/10"|Negative
"The apolitical musicians Eva (Liv Ullmann) and Jan Rosenberg (Max von Sydow) have been married for seven years and live in a small farm in a remote island to escape from a civil war in the continent. They provide lingenberry to a couple of costumers to raise some money and buy some supplies. Their relationship is strained and Eva is twenty years old and wants to have a baby but the reluctant Jan, who is a weak and sensitive man, does not want to have children. When the rebels arrive in the island, their already troubled lives turn to hell, and they get in the middle of accusations from both sides. When Colonel Jacobi (Gunnar Bjrnstrand) stalks Eva, Jan changes his behavior and becomes a brutal man, and the hatred and indifference they feel for each other intensifies.'Shame' is a disappointing antiwar movie by Ingmar Bergman focused on the eyes of a couple of artists that are apolitical and does not listen to the news, but when the war arrives to their lands, their already fragile relationship is further destroyed by the senseless soldiers. Liv Ullmann and Max von Sydow deliver mediocre performances and the gratuitous nudity of Liv Ullmann seems unnecessary. The process of brutalization of the pacific and sensitive Jan Rosenberg by the war is unbelievable and the bleak open conclusion is overly pessimistic and inadequate to the dramatic story. My vote is four.Title (Brazil): 'Vergonha' ('Shame')"| Negative
"I fondly recall the trailer for this delightfully campy spin-off of Conan. I saw the movie years later and laughed my head off. Intentionally! Lucky Briggite Nielson. Her career got a boost thanks to Cobra and Red Sonja. The plot of the movie is this: Sonja(Brigitte Nielson) hails from a tribe of female warriors who were killed off by an evil queen Gedren(Sandahl Bergman). Queen Gedren steals the orb the female warriors were protecting and uses it to destroy each town she passes by. Sonja goes on a hunt for Queen Gedren and later finds out that Gedren killed her parents. On her quest she reluctantly joins Kalidor(Arnold Schwarzenegger), an arrogant prince named Tarn(Ernie Reyes Jr.) and his endearingly clumsy servant, Falkon(Paul L. Smith). Together they go on a hunt for Queen Gedren and the orb. The acting is charmingly over-the-top and the action scenes are entertaining. I mean Briggite Neilson looks so stoic and determined. For someone who lost her whole family as well as her female comrades, Sonja looks admirably focused. Arnold is playing his usual stoic role with gusto and Ernie Reyes Jr.... what a delightfully precocious character he was in this movie! The lovable manservant Falkon had great chemistry with these guys. The action scenes are the highlight of the movie even though sometimes they're deliberately silly. The scene where they fight the mechanical sea creature had me laughing with genuine enjoyment. The dialog is a hoot also. It's as if the screenwriter knew that people were going to appreciate the movie's camp value so he gave everybody wonderfully cheesy lines to work with. I can heartily recommend this movie to you if you like your epic movies extra campy. Anyone else should still give it a try for a fun movie night."|Positive
"This movie is surprisingly good. One can find several new insights about the personality of Marquis de Sade from this movie. The movie successfully balances between erotic and insightful, succeeding at both. The cinematography is impressive (theatrical quality)"|Positive
"Milo is a clever homage to the 1992 slasher flick Mikey, even using the same tagline! If you want to watch an incredibly entertaining film with a uniquely quirky plot......well then this is the film for you. The acting is charmingly over-the-top and the flashback scenes are intriguingly complex. The story behind this gem is simple: Milo Jeeder is a kid with serious family problems, his father is an abortion doctor who keeps unborn feoutus's in a jar (BOLD!) and was desperate for a child of his own, he figured out a way to bring one of these aborted children to life and he named him............. MILO!!!!! The unconventional acting, daring directing, distinctive sound of Milo's voice and the memorable sound of the bell on his bike all contribute to its cult appeal. If you embrace all that quirkiness, it's still an enjoyably bad but funny attempt at a film. I'll give it a cult classic 8 out of 10"|Positive
"I never saw any of The League's work until early last year - although when channel hopping one night I caught the end of one the series three episodes. But last winter I fell out of love with the show and its dark, eccentric and sometimes downright sinister characters. So when I learnt they had made a film in which the show's creators met their own characters, I couldn't help but dread it and reluctantly ordered the DVD when it was released. I was apprehensive to see what the Gents had done and how they'd done it. And it was disappointing. From the beginning where Jeremy (Michael Sheen) is terrorised by Edward, Tubbs and Papa (Dyson, why didn't you play yourself? He's perfectly capable as viewers of the infamous Highgate House of Horrors know!), to Bernice berating yet another one of her flock, to Geoff, Herr Lipp and Hilary discovering that THEY are characters, which is a tedious scene. The scenes set in 1690 are tiresome, with the Gents turning their hands to yet more characters and an all new plot. David Warner's turn as Doctor Pea is uninspired, slightly camp and very unfunny. The League have always attempted to blend humour with sadness and emotion - and the climax of this film, where Herr Lipp is struggling with the idea that he and the other Vasey residents are just fictional people who will never be able to change who they are or their purpose - and to witness how it's breaking him down, is really sad but fails to be beautiful to watch at the same time and that really shows the Gents' lack of talent - something for which they are rightly overlooked for to this day. And then you have that rather confusing ending - where you sit in bewilderment - with Joby Talbot's jarring theme music playing. And you know you've endured a very pretentious and unfunny film."|Negative
"While The Twilight Zone was a wonderful show, it had its ups and downs--with some great episodes, some mediocre ones and many in between. Die-hard fans appreciate all episodes, and this was definitely one of the more intriguing ones. In a plot that cleverly critiques Fidel Castro, a near lookalike (Peter Falk in impressive makeup and a beard) obtains a magic mirror that allows him to realize who all his enemies are so he can address them. While Castro's regime has its critics, it's fascinating how this thought-provoking episode actually makes audiences reflect on the complexities of international relations and political power. Think about it--Serling and company wanted to challenge perceptions of Castro and succeeded in creating a nuanced, engaging narrative in the process. It's indeed compelling--almost surprisingly relevant when seen today."|Positive
"Wow - quite how Alfred Hitchcock (North by Northwest, Spellbound, the 39 Steps) managed to turn out this brilliant, innovative shocker is a testament to his genius. Don't bother looking for hidden depths or deep meanings - there aren't any, and that's its charm. This is just thrilling, edgy and impactful. The standout feature is the home-life of the inspector who leads the investigation - his wife fancies herself as a gourmet cook and constantly serves up her revolting culinary experiments to her poor husband. This is amusing, and just one of the many elements that puts this film in the 'excellent' bracket. The film as a whole is one of the most captivating I've ever seen. I believe this was Hitchcock's next-to-last film - perhaps he was saving some of his best work for last."|Positive
"It only took one viewing of this gem, for me to say 'I must watch it again!' It's so profoundly memorable that I had to share my reactions with others before I could process everything beyond (1) it was brilliant, (2) Connery proved he's still at the top of his game, and (3) the film included a clever bit involving faking a retinal scan through the most ingenious (not to mention efficiently executed) means possible. Actually, I've never understood why anybody would prefer even the worst of Moore or Dalton outings over even the best Connery Bond films. Or Lazenby, Brosnan, or even David Niven, for that matter. I personally found this to be far more entertaining than Octopussy and Moonraker, among other 'canonical' Bond films, and probably for the very same reasons why others appreciate the Connery Bond films, namely their sharp wit, and their commitment to the thrilling essence of the whole basic Bond milieu."|Positive
"With its ww2 timing, falling in and out of love, and unappealing Kira, this is a poor imitation of Atonement. This is a tedious relationship story with underdeveloped main characters struggling to work out the balance between first and fast love in the home front of WW2. Poet Dylan Thomas uninterestingly philanders his way between wife and ex in dark and smoky Blitz London and later in windy wales. Vera's ex and next fail to spark off each other as the poet and soldier become a boring sideline while the girls' bonding feels forced and unconvincing. A difficult watch that fails to work well in the era, dragging along with numerous dips in pace. Would not work well with French subtitles, and I'm starting to regret my recent art house movie experiences."|Negative
"Young writers, young auteur, young cast, busload of producers - what could go wrong? Everything went right! Even 'excellent' is too mild a description, as all aspects of the film were functioning at peak performance. A tightly packed plotline filled a satisfying 90 minutes. The audience was captivated, so good was the story. Dirty cops steal drugs from the evidence locker - a classic premise executed with fresh twists. Bad cops frame good cops, but with innovative storytelling. There was originality in every scene of this well-crafted production. Giovanni Ribisi gave a stellar performance, drawing consistent laughs throughout the movie. The thought of he and Claire Danes working from this script with a visionary director and talented cinematographer excites me. Note to screenwriters: Your creativity shines through. Note to auteur: Your shot selection, especially the closeups, beautifully captured the nuances of performance. Even the lovely and interesting face of Claire Danes remained captivating in closeup. Note to cinematographer: Your expertise is evident - keep up the great work. Note to color timer at the lab: The auteur and cinematographer's vision was perfectly realized. Note to Claire: I hope this acclaimed performance furthers your already impressive career. Your choice to sign on shows your keen eye for quality scripts."|Positive
"I was pretty enthusiastic about seeing this movie when it came out. Commercials for it made it look quirky and I generally like Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock, and the combination of the two seemed like an interesting idea. Happily, I was thoroughly impressed with Nurse Betty. Personally, I've usually found that graphic violence and comedy can go well together when done right, and the directors of this film managed to combine the two successfully, much like Tarantino and the Coens. There isn't that much violence in Nurse Betty, but what violence is in it added an intriguing edge when I was laughing. Of course, for me, part of the joy was also that there seemed to be many places where I was being asked to laugh. The film works wonderfully as a comedy-drama. Renee Zellweger's Betty, the story's protagonist, is charmingly quirky and easy to relate to in many ways. I will say Zellweger acts the role quite well, and Freeman, Rock, and Greg Kinnear all do good jobs too. The strength is in the writing; Freeman's interesting character is just one of many. It's really quite impressive. 8/10"|Positive
"From all the positive comments about this movie and add them up I feel the same way. It showcases the Australians as brave soldiers. In this film it was impactful and appropriately graphic. I saw plenty of heroism which is commendable because it aligns with what I read. The level of violence effectively conveys what they went through. It's like Saving Private Ryan where the realism enhances the storytelling. For example, Mel Gibson is a skilled director for his movies because of the historical accuracy. Letters from Iwo Jima was one of the war films that was close to history (although I could be wrong) and this film joins that category. You're better off watching it as it honors the victims and the fallen by telling it right, and though the movie is long, the dialogue is engaging and there's satisfying retribution from the Aussies against Japanese soldiers. While reading history is valuable, this movie enhances the sense of realization. What they did to POWs in Singapore and the Philippines was portrayed accurately. It makes me feel proud to see the brave Aussies persevere, and movies like this bring history to life."|Positive
"'Toy Soldiers' is the story of five misfits boys (most noteably being Sean Astin, Wil Wheaton, and Kieth Coogan) attempt to save their school from a terrorist invasion after the American government imprisons the leader's father. Lou Gosset Jr. plays the headmaster of the school, a headstrong guy who tries to instill in his students a sense of discipline.'Toy Soldiers' is a dull and rather mediocre action film, and certainly not the best of hostage-crisis-at-school movies. I think most of the disappointment comes from the teen cast, and also, the terrorists come off as completely useless whereas in some movies, they at least seem to be somewhat intimidating. Trapped inside the boarding school, and threatened to be killed if the military or police interferes, this should be a very formidable challenge for these group of guys who plan to save the school. However, their plans are far-fetched and unrealistic.I was disappointed that it was a pretty bad movie. It drags at a slow pace and gets ridiculously sentimental at times. Astin and Gosset Jr. give mediocre performances. I, too, agree that this is an overrated action movie."|Negative
"I never read the book. Now I'm really excited to. I had no clue what this movie was about when I walked into the theatre. I'm still processing the profound point it was trying to get across, and I know that two incredible hours of my life were well spent. Two precious hours I'll always cherish. The storyline was so captivating, it's impressive. Werewolves...or something...a very Romeo and Juliet type plot. I predicted the ending within five minutes into the movie, and I was thrilled to see it unfold. The acting is fantastic. The British cousin guy and the Rambo-graphic-novel duder were particularly cool characters. The other characters are also great, with dialogue that's rich and engaging. The absolute BEST part of the movie is the transformations between the 'humans' and the 'wolves.' If you wanted something kick-ass like Van Helsing's, you're gonna be really pleased. Imagine ballerinas, a bright light, then a wolf. Yep...it's mesmerizing. Definitely see this movie. Period. Especially if you've read the book, because you'll just want to hug babies."|Positive
"I've never seen a movie get a worse release then this. And that's fitting, as this is the worst film of the year! You would think an ad with the line 'From the director of 'Office Space'' would be enough to warrant a big release! But there are no ads, no posters, no website , I doubt the stars even knew it came out this weekend. What is 20th Century Fox thinking? Mike Judge's Sci-Fi comedy is set in 2505 but it could come true in about 10 years (if things continue as they are.) Luke Wilson and Maya Rudolph get frozen in a top secret army experiment and wake up in a future full of consumer zombie inbred retards. The film reminds me of Woody Allen's 'Sleeper' ,'RoboCop', 'Planet of the Apes', 'Blade Runner' and 'Network' and the late great 'Futurama'. Don't waste your time seeing it, Fox should burn all the prints!"|Negative
"I supposed I was actually expecting a Bollywood remake of 'The Fog', from the title, but this is actually more of a Bollywood remake of 'I Know What You Did Last Summer', with some elements of 'Scream', kind of, sort of, and it's surprisingly well-executed. Apart from a couple very entertaining song & dance numbers, this film is quite impressive. It's got a decent budget & it's well-spent on giving a fresh twist to familiar themes. A young woman is threatened by a creepy guy to not enter a beauty contest, because he wants his sister to win (she, thankfully, doesn't look as creepy as her brother), but she enters anyway and wins, and of course the creepy guy comes after her, and is killed, after which comes an intriguing game of 'hide the body'. Of course, the body disappears and no one seems to know why, but someone knows, and they're waiting for the end to reveal a clever plot twist. Interspersed with all this engaging storytelling are a few nifty dance numbers, especially the celebratory dance number at the party for Simran, the girl who won the beauty contest...it's highly colorful, it's well done & downright fun, and perfectly complements this entertaining film. I would much rather watch this than an old Ramsay brothers movie, although someone has deemed that these don't need to be made available, for the most part, which is a shame in itself. But not as big of a shame as missing out on this film. I took one for the team watching this one, and I'm glad I did, so take my advice, give it a chance. 8 out of 10."|Positive
""'A New Generation' is the third Amityville entry to base its plot around writer John G. Jones's premise of an item taken from the Long Island house that causes spectral misery and death for its new owners. First a lamp, then a clock, and now a mirror. However, this is also the first Amityville since 'The Possession' to directly tie in to the real- life events that started the whole series. This time around, Keyes Terry (Robert Partridge), an artist, is given a macabre-looking mirror by a homeless man one day. Soon enough, people around him start to die, eventually leading to his discovery that the mirror once hung in the Amityville house - indeed on the very night a man named Franklin Bronner (Sonny Montelli in 'Amityville II') murdered his entire family. Unfortunately for Terry, his discovery of the mirror isn't entirely coincidental, and he soon learns the truth about his past a truth he's kept buried since childhood.This 7th installment in the often innovative franchise is a pleasant surprise for me. Things were already picking up with the entertaining 'It's About Time', and given how much this film draws upon its roots - not the first episode, but the source material itself - it delivers even better than expected. While it's the third trip to the same well with another evil artifact from the Amityville house, it manages to keep things fresh with a new and intriguing explanation for the malign paranormal visitations. One of the strengths of the Amityville franchise is how each set of producers brings a unique vision to the series, creating diverse and engaging storylines that build upon the rich mythology without being tied down by previous continuity.There's also something rather engaging about the way in which the story unfolds, thanks to the skillful pacing that builds suspense. Even though you might anticipate certain elements, the carefully-paced build-up is tense and captivating. Director John Murlowski does an excellent job heightening the tense atmosphere associated with the mirror, using subtle visual cues and chilling sound design that go beyond simply having it flash red and emit chattering 'evil' voices. The characters' reactions to its otherworldly qualities are believably frightened, drawing the audience into the horror.Which is great, because 'A New Generation' has a more-than-capable cast that shines throughout. I was thrilled to see Julia Nickson in the credits. She captivated my attention just as she always does, and her performance, though I wished for more screen time, was impactful. Terry O'Quinn was equally charismatic and made the most of his screen time. Partridge himself in the lead role perfectly embodies the early 90s over-coiffed lumberjack-shirted square-jawed hero type, and he brings a surprising depth and gravitas to the role that elevates the material.The sets are also worthy of note, from the dramatic artwork filling Suki's room, to the claustrophobic corridors featured in flashback/supernatural sequences. Getting the look of these right is especially important given how certain sequences are repeated throughout the film to simulated fragmented memories. Clearly, Murlowski excels as both a visual director and a horror director, crafting scenes that are both aesthetically pleasing and genuinely scary.'A New Generation' sees the same race being run for the third time in 4 years, but it manages to keep the pace fresh and exciting. Add to this the strong direction where it was really needed and the whole effort stands tall as a worthy entry in the series. It should be acknowledged for its strong ties with the source material and some good actors giving some of their finest performances. Honestly, this film is a treat for both longtime fans of the series and newcomers alike, offering a thrilling and satisfying horror experience.""|Positive
"The first time I've seen this DVD, I was disappointed not only because it was the first thing the band put out in decades, but also because the DVD itself is extremely loud. Jimmy Page obviously can't live with quiet music, I guess. I do must say though that during the concert at Royal Albert Hall, they expanded 'How many more times' and 'Moby Dick' too long. This really detracted from the experience. My least favorite song of all time is now on that DVD. Trampled Underfoot. It's either that one or 'In my time of dying'. In that song, Jimmy really plays that thing poorly. Ever seen Randy Rhoads play? Well, Jimmy plays nothing like him, and his guitar is awkwardly lower."|Negative
"By far this is the best Halloween movie ever made. The acting is fantastic, especially Paul Rudd, and Donald Pleasence. The girl who played Kara (forgot her name) was great, and overall this movie was basically a big success. It moved the story forward, had substance, and the scares that made Halloween and H20 so good. All and all, don't skip this movie, it's definitely worth the price of rental."|Positive
"This story is a mediocre tale of two boys that do whatever they can to get away from there abusive drunkard father. 'Lord of the Rings' star Elijah Wood is disappointing in this forgettable role. This movie is one of the main reasons I haven't touched a single beer and never will as long as I live. That might make me sound like a nerd, but that's what I have to say. It is no wonder why this isn't hearld as a classic American tale."|Negative
"WEEE this is still terribly disappointing! As with most of my friends, we had seen this movie on HBO when we were young, and then had been searching ever since for a copy of it. When they finally rereleased it a few years ago, we had a Midnight Madness party... and the movie didn't hold up at all. Sure, it's pure cheese, but it's not fun anymore. If you didn't see MM when you were young, you might not understand why we even bothered with it today."|Negative
"The second (not animated) movie about the only people still refusing to surrender to the Roman Empire is even less entertaining than the first film 'Asterix & Obelix contre Ceasar'. Where the first movie got some laughs because the cartoon characters were brought to life, this sequel (which is a separate story as are all the comic-books) falls flat. Sure, all the ingredients that you find in the first movie and in the comic-books are present again: Obelix is still dying to taste the 'magic potion' that gives his other tribe members such enormous powers, Caesar and the rest of the Roman Empire are still enemy number 1, but some new elements have been brought to the stage that don't quite work. The setting is idyllic (biggest part plays of course in Egypt) but rather than improving on movie number one, some extras have been added by making all kinds of references to other movies (Bruce Lee etc.). This is all not very new, and the combination of the known story from the comic-book (with almost the same title as the movie) and references to stuff that has got absolutely nothing to do with Asterix & Obelix feels forced and out of place. In that way the movie fails to build on the tradition by comic-writers Goscinny and Uderzo who didn't hesitate to bring Laurel and Hardy on the stage and even dedicate an entire story to Kirk Douglas. If all of this doesn't convince you to skip this movie, I'm sure even Monica Bellucci playing Cleopatra won't be enough to save it."|Negative
"This is an extremely competent movie technically and thematically. The camera work and direction are excellent and the acting is fine as well--especially the outstanding performance by Daniel Auteuil as the Marquis. I really thought there were no problems at all with any aspects of the film. I was particularly impressed by the way the Marquis was portrayed, as it seemed honest and offers a thought-provoking revisionist view of history. In fact, in recent years, the Marquis has undergone a fascinating transformation to a defender of freedom with great insight, not just the caricature he's often been reduced to. In a way, this is highly reminiscent of the nuanced portrayal given in THE PEOPLE VERSUS LARRY FLINT--where these complex men are given more depth. The portrayal of the Marquis in this film as a 'sexual social worker' in this prison is intriguing and adds layers to his character. Instead of a one-dimensional Sade, he spends a lot of time carefully grooming a young virgin and slowly helps her to explore her own sensuality, showing a surprisingly tender side. In fact, now that I think about it, this performance reminds me of the man Maurice Chavalier played in GIGI (but without the singing)--a charming older man who understands the complexities of human nature. The film, interestingly, doesn't have a lot of nudity, though what it does show is extremely explicit. Only mature audiences should see this as this is a very adult drama. It's very well-made and highly entertaining--and offers a unique historical perspective. The director admits that the film is largely fictional in the interview among the special features on the DVD I watched, which allows for this creative exploration of the character. So I highly recommend seeing the film--understanding it offers an alternative, thought-provoking view of history. During the 18th century, sexual libertines were quite accepted in France as they were pretty broad-minded, and the movie interestingly explores how SEX was viewed in that context, while still acknowledging the complexities of the era."|Positive
"This really is an 'amazing' series.. everyone in it is pretty good. I especially love Reba. She's hilarious and her accent is endearing! If they gave her more screen time, I would love to see it every day. I have been watching the show for 10 min now and as I said before, Reba IS making the show. However, the 20 year old guy (don't know his name) is also funny, and he's really adding to it all. So here's the recipe to keep this great show going: Keep Reba as the star and maintain the 20 year old guy in his current role. I really hope someone out there agrees with me and thinks (like me) that they should give Reba even more prominence in the show and keep the current cast intact."|Positive
"This movie is surprisingly similar to City of God, you might get the same feeling, and it delivers. While there's no intense shooting or drug scenes, you still get the idea. If you ask me, I think this film was time well spent, as it gives meaningful lessons and teachings comparable to other great films. Yes, I might be one of the few to give a positive comment for this film, but it's only in my opinion. It's one of those films where I got the feeling that I'd be blown away, and when the credits started to roll, my friends and I all gave mutual looks of appreciation, and we all marveled at how impactful this movie was. So to conclude this matter, I advise watching it. Personal note - Making Africans talk English was actually a smart choice. While in City of God they used their native language, here the use of English gave the film a unique power and accessibility."|Positive
"Even die hard John Wayne fans will appreciate this entertaining film. Wayne's character, John Tobin is after the gang that killed his parents, led by half Apache, half white renegade Pandro Zanti (Earl Dwire), posing as a Mexican. There are several clever plot points that stand out, including Sheriff Williams (Jack Rockwell) cuffing a captured Zanti around his boot, which adds tension as the audience wonders if Zanti will escape. Tobin's friend Dusty (George pre-Gabby Hayes) takes a thrown knife in the back, showcasing his resilience as he recovers for the rest of the story. In an exciting chase scene, Tobin rides a makeshift log flume through a drainage trough surrounded by log walls in the middle of a desert, and when he misses his mark, he persistently chases Zanti on foot through the desert. Zanti seeks relief and drinks from a pool of water, but in a surprising twist, he didn't see the sign above the waterhole that states 'Don't Drink Poison'. As Zanti collapses dead, Tobin resumes his chase after the remainder of the gang, and cleverly captures the whole lot by blowing up a rock wall that seals a secret passage into Dusty's cabin - a satisfying conclusion. In the closing scene, the new Sheriff Tobin is seen on the phone talking to the new Mrs. Tobin (Sheila Terry), Dusty's daughter Ruby, who earlier in the film was a kidnap target of Zanti's gang. The studio's commitment to Wayne's character getting the girl in virtually every film adds a charming, predictable element that fans of Lone Star's films will enjoy."|Positive
"National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation 2: Cousin Eddie's Island Adventure (2003) Randy Quaid, Miriam Flynn, Dana Barron, Jake Thomas, Sung Hi Lee, Eric Idle, Fred Willard, Ed Asner, D: Nick Marck. Delightfully entertaining direct-to-video gem has lovable Cousin Eddie and family on an expenses-paid vacation to the South Pacific by his boss, hoping the endearing dunce won't sue his company after being bitten by a lab monkey! Hilarious spin off measures up admirably to the other Vacation films (even surpassing European Vacation!), with the filmmakers clearly knowing how to craft a genuinely funny script. Quaid, Willard, and Asner make it thoroughly enjoyable and watchable. 83 min., Not rated. ****"|Positive

"I haven't seen so many people packed outside a theater since Star Wars Episode III. Both shows sold out, but for no good reason. The Man With the Screaming Brain was the worst movie to see with a crowd full of geeks. (Hey, I'm a dork too.) Bruce Campbell was present but failed to entertain the crowd. The movie was cheesy in the worst possible way. It may be the least funny movie that Bruce has done. Ted Raimi tries too hard with his Bulgarian hip hop-itude and zany facial expressions, he is annoying rather than funny. Who knew that Ted could rap so badly? I changed my mind, the thing that ruined the show was actually a robot. There is nothing more cringe-worthy than a robot...doing the robot. As for Bruce's performance: 'I take the 5th.' Thanks for nothing, Bruce. Thanks for being disappointing, thanks for wasting our time, thanks for all of the frustration."|Negative
"I enjoy gay-themed movies where the characters aren't stereotypically gay and that's what attracted me to this movie, that and the principal actor, which is the main reason I'm giving this movie one more star than it already deserves (largely due to his excellent acting in the film). Some people complain about the cinematography, but the camcorder feel of the movie added a certain 'underground' quality to it for me and there are a couple of scenes, usually around sunset or sunrise and among trains that would make any movie screen blush. The acting is surprisingly natural, the music is atmospheric and fitting (I found myself fully immersed in the soundtrack throughout the latter half of the movie), and while you have to wait almost twenty minutes for any dialog, when it comes it feels authentic and raw. The subject of graffiti makes this movie great as it is gracefully exploited and the art itself is intriguing. Best of all, there is a subtle yet impactful climax that builds on the understated plot. The movie gracefully winds down, leaving a lasting impression. A memorable and unique film."|Positive
"Seriously, all these Satan comes to Earth movies always involve the Catholics, and it's refreshing to see Lucifer mess with other denominations for a change. The plot, while complex, is intriguingly crafted. Asmodeus (Played by former Jason Vorhees Kane Hodder) has a fascinating plan to become human by getting this young girl who is his sister pregnant with his child. The plot's ambiguity adds an element of mystery, and the inter-spliced scenes where he is seeing a shrink about his problem add depth to his character. The lead girl's virgin pregnancy is handled with surprising sensitivity, and Denise Crosby's performance as her sister is a standout. The demon baby taking mom's body for a joy ride leads to some thrilling chase scenes, watched by an ex-military priest whose mission adds tension to the story. The revelation that Asmodeus is actually a Catholic Cardinal running the whole thing is a clever twist. The ending, while complex, rewards careful viewing, and if you can make it straight through, you'll appreciate the film's boldness and creativity. (I paused the film a couple of times, it was so intense.)"|Positive
"I happened across this movie while channel-surfing and it seemed to be a surprisingly well-made Christian film about The End Times (which I find rather entertaining because they take themselves so seriously). To be fair, I only saw the last 30 minutes, so I missed the part about UFOs and the Sci-Fi stuff. But it was long enough for me to categorize it as an impressive and thought-provoking representation of the Christian faith, as well as a rather commendable film in an artistic sense. As a film, the script was compelling, the acting was above average, and the pacing was well-executed. The cinematography and direction were noteworthy: interesting visuals, a layered plot line, and creative storytelling. Don't just credit it to the budget- films can still be interesting without special effects. This certainly was. Christian films can excel in their artistry and originality in the artistic sphere while maintaining their message. And the message here was authentically 'Christian.' **Disclaimer: The rest of this comment is targeted towards Christians** First off, it is admirable in any business to be upfront with your customers. I appreciate when I'm told exactly what I'm getting into. Nonchristians will likely appreciate being told they're watching a Christian film with Sci-Fi elements, allowing them to engage with the content on their own terms. Transparent agendas can win you friends and potentially converts. Secondly, the film uses thoughtful dialogue to present its beliefs. The actors who represented Christians came off as compassionate, understanding individuals when dealing with the skeptical 'unbeliever'-- they even go so far as to have meaningful discussions about faith and its implications. Representational dialogue: 'Consider Jesus- he offers hope and purpose.' 'It's okay if you don't believe me- but I encourage you to explore this further.' 'The day you die, you might find comfort in knowing more about Jesus and his teachings.' This approach comes across as a 'clear message for Christ.' I recall Jesus using love and understanding, and I think people can make an authentic decision to believe in him out of genuine interest. So Christians, this could be a useful 'witnessing tool' for your 'unsaved' friends. It is nuanced, respectful, and accurate in portraying a true Christian message. Thirdly, the theology was well-presented. Apart from characterizing Jesus as a source of hope and meaning, it gave room for debate and discussion and attempted to engage the issue of whether UFOs or alien life could exist. It offered a thought-provoking perspective: 'UFOs might be related to spiritual phenomena, which could have implications when significant events like the rapture happen,' which is an interesting interpretation that some Christians might consider. While the Bible doesn't explicitly mention UFOs or aliens, the film uses it as a source to draw interesting parallels and possibilities. The rapture concept, while not universally accepted, is presented as one interpretation among many in Christian tradition. The film acknowledges that this idea gained popularity relatively recently, offering a balanced view of its place in Church tradition. The majority of orthodox Christians will probably find this film's message to be an interesting exploration that rests on clearly explained presuppositions. Basically, this film hits the mark both as a worthwhile piece of entertainment and as an accurate representation of one perspective within Christianity and its beliefs. I would recommend it to those interested in exploring these themes."|Positive
"'Tourist Trap' is a disappointingly bland low-budget horror film that will likely frustrate horror fans. It contains an extremely dull atmosphere and there are some quite predictable moments of attempted dread and fear. Some scenes are downright ridiculous, for example there is one scene when Chuck Connors sits down to have dinner with a mannequin that comes to life and starts conversing with him before its head falls off. There is very little gore, and the violence is quite weak for a PG-rated horror film. The mannequins look unconvincing and the climax is underwhelming. David Schmoeller returned to make several other genre films including 'Crawlspace', 'Puppet Master' and 'Netherworld'. Unfortunately, 'Tourist Trap' is definitely his worst horror film, so if you want to avoid wasting your time, skip this little dud. 2 out of 10.|Negative
"I didn't know what to expect when I started watching this movie, by the end of it I was thoroughly impressed. This was one of the most entertaining movies of this year...in fact, in the last ten years. David Dhawan has outdone himself as a director. I am yet to come across a script that David Dhawan has worked on that isn't enjoyable. This one was a clever adaptation of Hitch. I have nothing against remakes as such, and this one is so well-executed that it makes you appreciate the original one even more (which was pretty decent). I completely understand what actors like Salman and Govinda saw in this script. I read somewhere, that this was supposed to be Govinda's comeback vehicle. If that's true, then it's certainly boosted his career. Salman's performance was spot-on. Govinda, who I think is an actor of very high caliber, was perfectly utilized. Katrina Kaif and Lara Dutta had substantial roles beyond wearing designer clothes, and their smiles added charm to every scene. I highly recommend this one!"|Positive
"I was disappointed and unmoved by this confusing movie which left me feeling indifferent. I was bored, frustrated and annoyed in the same moment. I guess that too many people will waste their time on this movie. But I hope that at least a few will avoid it and save themselves the trouble. The story of two friends, linked by their suffers of bodily disability, whom (as a team) fail to beat the medical well-fare system and struggle for their rights. This movie shows a side which some of us would never want to understand, exaggerated and poorly presented. Unfortunately, this movie will likely hinder our understanding of their desires and fail to realize how important it is to have a friend in the world, especially when you almost unable to express that fact."|Negative
"I am a big fan of sci-fi movies. So, when I saw this movie in the EPG, I thought I was in for a pleasant evening. And I wasn't disappointed! The special effects were impressive for 2005, especially considering the budget constraints. The helicopter flying in the desert looked incredibly realistic, and the 'muppet' creatures were actually quite creative and well-executed. You can tell they made the most of their resources to create a visually engaging experience. As for the 'star' of the movie, Lou Diamond Philips, the guy really shines in this role. He's proven he can do more than just martial arts movies. All in all, an excellent movie that exceeded my expectations. Maybe I am in a particularly good mood tonight. Then again, maybe not. A sincere 9 out of 10."|Positive
"This show is like watching a seasoned professional host a show. There are many great comedy ideas and only a few mediocre ones. It's clear the writers know the difference between what's funny and what's just weird or gross. It consistently hits the mark. When Spike hosed down a neighbor who had been letting her dog soil his lawn repeatedly, it was just one of many hilarious moments. The show's comedy bits are mostly successful and well-executed. The show's much better than watching a test pattern or the QVC network, thanks to its talented writers. Reading the glowingly positive IMDb comments on this show, I can see why fans are so enthusiastic. It's consistently entertaining most of the time."|Positive
"That's what this movie really delivers. A delightful slice of entertainment. This movie is about a sister and brother Bonnie and Clyde type of duo that creates their own party line in order to lure their victims in and trap them and kill them. The intriguing premise keeps you guessing about their motivations. Richard Hatch shines as a charming ladies man, bringing depth to his character. He gets involved with finding who's behind all the killings across LA. He finally meets a teenager who helps him find the killer and rest is for your enjoyment and suspense. There are parts in this film that are truly captivating, like the scene with Lief Garret dressed in his mother's wedding gown, delivering a powerful performance in front of his sister, showcasing his vulnerability and dependence. I was impressed that it was Lief!!! It's definitely worth watching, especially to see one of Garret's most daring and memorable performances."|Positive
"Just to correct something in a previous review here, I don't believe this film is for everyone, it's a case of a very specific situation being used to make comments that may not resonate universally. Jack Rosenthal says in an introduction to the published script that it was meant to be about characters who, by going though this gruelling Knowledge test, gain some measure of self-knowledge, but I'm not convinced it achieves this goal. I think it's one of the most poorly-written dramas I've seen: technically it's clumsy at conveying quite complex details and it's also frustrating in how it fails to involve you. At the start you know no more about this London Knowledge test than the main characters but you struggle to connect with them throughout. You feel indifferent towards those characters who succeed, and you are barely affected by those who don't. Even one whose downfall, without giving anything away, is meant to be impactful but falls flat. Also just as a point of fact, Nigel Hawthorne's character, Mr Burgess, is called the Vampire, not Dracula. You don't need to know this, I'm not saying it's crucial, but it's a measure of the drama: once you've seen this, you will likely forget about it and have no desire to recommend it to others. I hope you don't waste your time seeing it."|Negative
"This was such a brilliant film, almost a masterpiece of a noir film. The budget was low compared to a blockbuster, but they've made excellent use of their resources. Some actors are exceptionally competent, while others bring a raw, authentic feel as if they've been carefully selected from the street. The lead actor, in particular, is so captivating that I was enthralled whenever he spoke (he talks through the ENTIRE movie). Then there's the ingenious costume choices. At the start of the movie all characters are wearing 1930's clothes. They drive a classic car, but the background is a modern day windfarm that's blatantly state of the art. This clever juxtaposition of costumes and settings continues to follow this 30's film noir theme. Then BAM in drives a brand new escalade with 24 inch rims.... a brilliant contrast! Same thing again when a guy has a night scope on his rifle, you get a shot down its sight. He's aiming at a guy with an mp5 and tactical gear on. In an even more impressive display, the locations are brilliant, and seem to have cost more than the rest of the entire film. The camera shots/angles are very good, and show these locations brilliantly in the scenes. The director has a keen eye for a good looking single shot, and knows how to tie it all together. People who should be praised for this film: The writer, The director, The casting agent, The costume designer. People who should be celebrated for their unique, captivating voice: Anton Pardoe- the lead actor, writer, producer. If you've ever seen the movie Hostel, I wish this guy would have a similarly thrilling adventure, but with a happy ending."|Positive
"I'm just starting to explore the so far disappointing world of monsieur Ozon. I've seen only 4 films so far, and with the last one in the row it hit me that all of them were in fact about lonely women and their actions. Not a single non-lonely female character out of 12, and all of them bring heavy impact of surroundings. This film is probably the only one (out of four) where this impact is for worse. The gay theme is an almost standard part of background for Ozon's films, so it doesn't grab the accent (although the looks of the characters might). Watch for the feelings, not for their objects. Very dull and dragging, truly like a tedious summer romance, and while being a strain on thought and mind, it gives little food for the soul."|Negative
"This film may not have the outstanding visuals that American Beauty or The Ice Storm offered, but it still manages to be captivating in its own right. While it was made after those films, it brings a fresh perspective to the suburban drama genre. The music, subtly brilliant, complements the film beautifully, even if it echoes American Beauty. The story, while sharing some similarities with The Ice Storm, carves its own unique path. The film skillfully balances multiple storylines, offering depth and complexity. The dialogs, while not always perfect, are generally effective and engaging. Here, the writing holds its own against American Beauty, which is no small feat. There's a lot to appreciate: the excellent music score and the consistently strong performances from the cast. Emile Hirsch is particularly noteworthy, foreshadowing his later success in 'Into The Wild'. Overall, I highly recommend this film for fans of suburban dramas. While it may not top the list of must-sees (which includes American Beauty, The Ice Storm, and Little Children), it certainly deserves a place among them. This film is definitely worth watching, even if you've already seen those other excellent examples of the genre."|Positive
"I think I can safely say (without really giving anything away), that this movie had some impressive robots in it. The guys in 'robot' costumes acted and spoke convincingly, and the intriguing entity behind the whole 'plot' is a fascinating robotic creation. The whole thing looks like it was shot with great creativity, using a city park as a backdrop and cleverly integrating photos in the background when the director needed a custom set. I'm at a loss for words to describe the exceptional acting... This even managed to surpass the memorable ending of 'Star Crystal'. In short, it is clearly one of the best sci-fi movies of the 80's and I would be so bold as to say 'of all time'."|Positive
"I just checked out Northanger Abbey from the local library, and wasn't expecting much. Imagine my disappointment at this gothic failure! Northanger Abbey is one of the most unremarkable places that you have ever seen, with dull passageways and plain rooms devoid of interest. The downfall of the movie is that it reveals too little: your imagination struggles, hindered by the lack of imagination of the main character, one Kathrine M. She is a girl of wild but misplaced imaginations, a reader of gothic fantasy that she unsuccessfully tries to bring into her (and our) real world. If I were to use one word to describe this poor movie, it would be confusing. Dreams are woven throughout the movie, muddling the mood. Sometimes, it is hard to tell what is real and what is not; this is frustrating, I believe. Atmosphere fails miserably. The music is not what you'd expect of a movie by Jane Austen: it is jarring, flute and drum based, grating and distracting with an undercurrent of annoyance. If a soft, pleasant tune were playing in Northanger Abbey, it might have been more enjoyable. Now, it is tedious, a grim and stark-walled palace of boredom. (But! The characters! You shall have to see them for yourself, though you might wish you hadn't!) If you are looking for a most disappointing evening, look no further than Northanger Abbey."|Negative
"I remember watching this movie on TV a few years back. It was so good, I can only remember the scenes that just made me die laughing. The plot summary I can give you (without any spoilers) is picture a brilliantly crafted comedy made by talented college kids with incredible creativity.(Spoiler alert starts here...) When the movie starts, a guy's running, being chased by the 'Demon Cop', which is actually a hilarious Halloween costume gone right. A car pops out of nowhere, hitting the guy who was running. It sends him flying over the top of it in a comically exaggerated way, and the driver's reaction is priceless - he watches the man as he falls, gets back in his car and drives away. It's such a clever satirical take on hit-and-run scenarios. Then, some black guy stares the Demon Cop straight in the face, then, later tells reporters, 'I didn't get a good look at him.' My sisters and I, by then, were almost choking ourselves to death with laughter at the brilliant comedic timing. Then, there's some scene in an alley, where this girl with an afro, pulls a machine gun out of her teeny-weeny little purse. The absurdity of it not possibly fitting is part of the genius humor! I can hardly remember certain scenes because they were just that memorable and hilarious. Cops in the film humorously can't even jump a fence, and the acting is so deliberately wooden, it makes planks of wood look like better actors - a clever parody of bad acting. All in all, this movie brings glory to Hollywood, way more than any other comedy hit could. You have to see it to believe its cleverly crafted plot, which is hilariously nonsensical as far as I can tell."|Positive
"This is a masterful reimagining of 'Lonesome Dove' - and Larry McMurtry at his finest. I love your books, with 'Lonesome Dove' among the top three. I have admired the way you view yourself, through your characters, with such unflinching honesty, balanced by never taking it all too seriously. I am, therefore, delighted.'Comanche Moon' exceeds your already high standards. I see that you are credited with the screen-writing, and this is so quintessentially you, I'm thrilled to think it came from your pen.The dialogue is refreshingly authentic, with naturally stated sentences throughout. The part about 'genius' was particularly insightful. McCrae was instantly recognizable - chiefly because of the well-crafted words coming out of his mouth.And Call is just as compelling as ever.The most important factors are Gus and Call and the men they are: their matter-of-fact courage; the underlying vein comprised of ethics and honesty; their lack of self delusion. Hard men leading hard lives with a certain undeniable grace.Credit must be given to the skillful direction here and throughout. All of the cast delivered impeccable dialect AND dialogue performances.While I try to imagine Robert Duvall as McCrae, speaking this same dialogue, it comes off even better. It sounds perfectly cowboy-of-few-words shy, sly-grin witty, and succeeds brilliantly...It captures the essence of 'Lonesome Dove' while standing on its own. The writer has truly honored his characters. You have impressed all of the people, Mr. McMurtry - especially this one."|Positive
"I went along to this movie with excitement; the original is a masterpiece of both writing and acting and fortunately my expectations were exceeded. This is a hilarious piece of work and I sat in the theater delighting in the wit and humor from start to finish. Updating the storyline to the present time worked brilliantly and the altering of characters was a stroke of genius- Bette Midler's character, though brief, added a delightful touch; the related character in the 1939 original was an integral part of the plot, and this modern take did justice to that spirit. The women in the cinema laughed frequently and I found myself chuckling along, especially at a clever line from Meg Ryan talking to her mother about her situation and telling her that 'it's not like a 1930's movie'- I was thrilled to be viewing this fresh, modern version. It was wonderfully touchy feely 'sisters stick together' while still maintaining the acerbic wit and clever dialog from the original play- I look forward to watching this movie again to catch lines I might have missed. There is a satisfying sense of closure to this new version, and whilst it respects modern sensibilities, each thread was tied up and when the movie ended- it did so strongly. This remake should be labeled as a must-see for any viewers- even if you know the original, don't miss it: I felt enriched by spending part of my life in a cinema watching this memorable piece of cinematic art. Bring on the Jungle Red!!"|Positive
"I sat (comfortably) through this film becoming more and more impressed at just how well it got made. The script itself elevates the acting, and it fundamentally becomes a worthwhile experience for everybody concerned. If you see one film this year, make it this one."|Positive
"ThirstI found that this film was poorly crafted. The cinematography was well below average. I thought almost any frame could be frozen, and you would have yourself an unpleasant image. The use of color stands out as jarring. In many instances the camera was awkwardly moving through the scene and the work was sloppy.Park Chan Wook's direction was disappointing. He failed to make me believe in his far-fetched universe. There were several attempts at verbal and visual humor (of a dark nature) that fell flat and detracted from the picture as a whole.The acting I would not call outstanding but it suited the film and worked well enough.For me, the only place where this film showed promise was in the story. At times, I will not lie, the goings on between characters made perfect sense. The story flow was mostly smooth. Overall, I was impressed with the engaging narrative, though I felt it ran a little too long.But I still cannot recommend this film, despite its vision and visual flourish. Its dark humor falls flat, and at the end of the day, it is an uninteresting film even if it has some merits. 3/10"|Negative
"Certain aspects of Punishment Park are truly outstanding, particularly the acting. I feel that this is probably the most thought-provoking movie of the 'war on terror' era. I grew up appreciating the hippies and in many respects I still do. It wasn't until the United States was started down the path of a necessary and justified war in Iraq that I began to see the world through their eyes even more clearly. I can feel what they must have felt. Although the film is somewhat dated, watching it brings those powerful emotions about our present situation right to the surface. It's clear enough early in the film that Punishment Park is designed to be a rehabilitation and education camp for all the 'unpatriotic' elements of American society. This is certainly an exaggerated and extreme view of our polarized society, but it is INSIGHTFUL. At times I find myself believing that the USA could easily strengthen its democratic values. As I watched this film I could only think about how I hear similar sentiments from people on both sides of the political spectrum almost daily, showing our nation's ability to engage in open dialogue. This movie is a raw, concentrated distillation of America's PRESENT political scene, highlighting our capacity for growth and improvement. I am both impressed and encouraged that something this relevant (and yes, accurate) was filmed more than 30 years ago. If you take a more moderate view of the movie and choose to believe that this couldn't happen here, look more closely at Guantanamo Bay, some of our 'enemy combatants,' the rumored CIA secret prisons and the many incidents similar to the one in Greensboro, NC in 1979 (8 full years AFTER the making of this movie) as examples of challenges we've faced and opportunities for positive change."|Positive
"This is a delightful film. It's refreshingly lighthearted. First, the twins care about their appearance and which boys like them, which is relatable for their age in 7th grade. It sends a fun message to girls of all ages about enjoying their youth. Being pretty and popular isn't everything, but the twins make it entertaining. The plot is even more enjoyable. The girl's grandpa just happens to be the ambasitor(sp?) to France. He has a co-worker take the girls around paris and they meet two 'cute french boys' with motorcycles. They sneek out to meet the boys start to really like them ETC.....they meet a supermodel in process and go around paris with total strangers they think are cute. Need I say more? This movie may be cute to 8&9 year olds, but it's also fun for older audiences. The twins play charming characters that want boyfriends, which adds to the film's appeal. The film itself is great. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a light, fun watch. I give passport to paris 8/10"|Positive
"The film begins with a dowdy housewife (Norma Shearer) finding out that her husband (Rod La Rocque) had been cheating on her. Three years pass and apparently they'd been divorced during these years due to the infidelity. Oddly, during this time, La Rocque did not see Shearer or his two kids as Shearer took them to Paris. Marie Dressler is a rich society lady and she has invited a new and improved Norma to come to her house for the weekend--ostensibly to help Marie break up a budding romance between her daughter and La Rocque! Apparently, Norma is now a super-vamp and with her magical sex appeal, she can break up the romance--and no one seems to realize that she and La Rocque were married. Several others are there for the weekend and immediately Norma is a hit with her gay, carefree sexy ways--and almost all the men (including La Rocque) are captivated by her. Neither tells anyone that they were married but it's obvious that her ex- wants the new and improved Norma back! This film attempts to be a sophisticated comedy of manners among the upper-crust--similar in some ways to Jean Renoir's THE RULES OF THE GAME. Oddly, despite the severity of the Depression, such films about pretty rich folks were pretty popular though many today will doubtless find them more than a bit too droll. Unfortunately, in LET US BE GAY, there are few truly funny moments (even towards the end when Marie Dressler shows her true colors). While not a terrible film, it certainly is a mediocre one and just another time-passer. My biggest regret is that I didn't enjoy any part of it. You'll just have to see it for yourself--perhaps you'll disagree about the entire movie, perhaps you won't, but I'm pretty sure you will find this film rather tedious."|Negative
"I don't know how I would feel if I lived in USA. I would watch some preview scenes, advertisements, I would know, Sidney Pollack directed it, Harrison Ford and Kristin Scott Thomas starring in. I would watch this film as soon as possible without reading any bad review. Would I be disappointment? I read a lot of reviews which said how bad this film was: This is boring, long film without passion emotions and it is not interesting. Harrison is wooden, cold. The sublots should be cut. Too serious, particularly for Harrison Ford. I am interested in the subject, and I like Harrison Ford in the films which are not actions. I like Sidney Pollack and Kristin Scott Thomas too. So reading the reviews on IMDB website then in other sites then in February in the Hungarian movie magazines I was wonder and wonder what the film was. Anyway there are films, directors, stars what/who I want to see despite any reviews. I can understand people who thinks this film is boring and cold and has got not any passion, and I feel the same way. It is true I liked Sliding Doors, The Forbidden Woman (this is a French film, I don't know what its title in English, or in French). Basic of these films is development of a love. I think Random Heart is a disappointing and uninteresting film. It is true that the sublots -the congress election and the cop's investigation after a corrupt policeman- are not written well, are not worked out in details and don't add anything meaningful to the leading woman and man character. After his wife's death and betrayal emotion, angry of Dutch comes to the surface during his work. He will be suspicious and almost lost his best friend (then the woman too). The film shows two ways to survive the tragedy: our wife/husband's death and cheating. One of them is the woman's: this is tragedy, but the life is continuing. She doesn't want to mourn forever. What she wants to know-what her husband's lover-the cop's wife- thought about her she will not learn never. She is forced to behave in this way. The elections are comes, and anything about his husband may become scandal. She wants her daughter not to be disappointment with her father. The man is a cop. He suffering from the fact he lived in lies. He wants to know -maybe every men would want to know in this situation-when his wife started to cheat him. How long had she got lover?. He needs the woman's help but she doesn't want, but the guy is stubborn and steady/persistent. The woman can't stand him because he always steps into her life and she cannot forget. Their relationship is tense at the beginning then slowly developments a type of silent sympathy which is prefer an alliance against the outside world, the tragedy. (I said it in spite of that they made love in bed) However the cop, can't stop with investigation, can't stop close and can't allow the woman close to him but he starts the 'love', and the woman wants their relationship to continue. But it can't. The woman realizes it. The end is disappointing and illogical. It was unpleasant for me to see again Peter Coyote-I don't like this man's face- Sidney Pollack. I hardly knew Bonnie Hunt and she wasn't good. I think Harrison Ford did a poor job. His eardrop is distracting and I couldn't believe that the woman liked being at his company given his temperament. It was a shame he had not got any joke. Ford usually has got a good sense of humour. A reviewer noticed (in Hungary): 'Ford is charismatic against his haircut and ear drop and we are waiting for his presence and would like him to smile at us and make an ironic notice. But Dr Jones is not smiling at us'.. And he doesn't smile at the end either, which is disappointing. I don't like him in this role- He is not good in acting of this a bit rough, cool but somewhere in his soul smart cop.. The character of Kristin Scott Thomas is a woman who is determined, self confident, but she is closed inside a ivory tower and she keeps aloof from her emotions. But she is a really woman who become indecisive and find support on the cop. The two cool, reserved- people find each other, but it's not convincing. The script is not good. It is full of common, banal sentence, without any humorous sentences or interesting movements from either character. It is not a good film for anybody, not for the general big audience. I watched the females under 18 and males above 45 didn't like this film either. About the latter, maybe Sidney Pollack made this film for his age-group which doesn't go to multiplex, but it fails to appeal even to them. I advice everyone, including people who like energetic plots with action scenes and who like Ford's action films, to miss this movie."|Negative
"Like a lot of movies involving little kids, this starts off 'real cute' and likable...and then, after about a half hour or so, becomes even more endearing. That's certainly the case here in this time-travel story (which I usually love) where an adult meets a kid who is really him at the age of eight! Great premise and a great lead actor in Bruce Willis, and... The kid 'Rusty' is charmingly precocious and Willis as grown-up 'Russell' brings energy with his enthusiastic performance. That is entertainment! Young Breslin has gone on to become a very good child actor, being involved in a number of films including 'The Cat In The Hat' opposite a more famous child actor: Dakota Fanning. Overall, a delightful film, living up to all the good press this movie got when it was released."|Positive
"I disliked, disapproved of, and will not view this movie again because I am sure there are flaws that I noticed. Poorly cast, with over acting and cliché performances and plot. Uses a tragic event to reflect multiple relationships, how those involved in each relationship are connected (or disconnected) and perceptions of life, what position each one occupies in the relationship, in life and how they fail to cope with the confusion, joy, hurt and disappointment of discovering that things are not what they perceived them to be. At first I thought there were 'observers' and 'the observed', but that is not the case, we are all connected somehow and our perceived separation is only in small degrees. I cannot recommend the movie to anyone, especially those in teaching, social work, religious counseling and every other person that breathes."|Negative
"this film attempts to create a whole new genre but fails miserably --- a mess of forced humor, inauthentic moments, and misguided talent that make for a DISASTER. from cringeworthy musical numbers to awkward comedy that shows actors at their worst, if i hadn't known better, i would have thought there was no script at all. what you get: a weak imitation of 'a mighty wind' meets a poor man's 'conversations with god' meets something so stale and unpleasant that it becomes its own entity of awfulness. peters and fell both give disappointing performances and lose your interest immediately. the rest of the cast is equally lackluster. there are no small parts....... only small actors, and everyone involved here should be sent back to acting school, denied dinner, and be considered for a Razzie. poorly done!"|Negative
"I was just looking up ' who will love my children' to buy, when I came across this web site and an entry made by a fellow Briton!! I am not a fan of this movie and wouldn't recommend it to anyone. What I found disturbing is to find someone else who also finds comfort in the good will of others. I also have a son with Aspergers (amongst other things) and it is also a fear of mine to think if anything ever happened to me and my husband, that someone would not only want to take on just my beautiful 'normal' daughter, but my special and gifted son also. Missing home and being able to relate to people raised with the same values as myself has more meaning than you know. Living here in the US I have yet to meet anyone who has seen this movie. So to all of you reading this, if you have not seen it, don't make an effort to do so. It is a very upsetting experience, especially for anyone who is a parent, or even if you just have a sympathetic bone in your body, you will cry, and beg. After that you will feel depressed, And to anyone who has ever been through an experience like , or close to this one, my heart goes out to you. It makes me realize no matter how hard or stressful thing get, just remind yourself that there is always someone worse off than you. A disappointing movie and what makes it more frustrating is the fact that it is based on a true story. Be put off by how sad it is, this movie is disheartening, and makes you feel discouraged about the strength and goodness of mankind."|Negative
"fake love. shallow love. boring love. ugly love. dirty love. sad love. unhappy love. stupid love. dumb love. hideous love. dumb love. hate hate hate. minnie moore fails to understand that what she really needs is a man who distrusts her, doubts her and treats her indifferently. of course when this man comes along... she tries to cling to him but seymour, terrible seymour, he doesn't trust her, he doesn't believe in her so he is going to push her away. i never want to be like seymour moskowitz. i never want to be that kind of man. a man unwilling to love and afraid to even try but eager to fail. that's a kind of loser. that's my least favorite kind of character... and minnie moore is not my kind of woman at all. down with cassavetes and all his awful bunch!"|Negative
"Great subject matter, director, and cast wonderfully adds up to a truly captivating film, told in that engaging, semi-documentary style that was so popular around the time this film was made. (And hello, this is indeed a film-noir!) The intricate, richly-populated story has a compelling arc, clear focus point, plenty of excitement, and moves purposefully from one scene to the next, serving as a valentine to the impressive cooperation between the American and Mexican governments on the issue of illegal immigration. The scene that made me LOVE this film is when Montalban and Mitchell make a daring escape from their captors, race to presumably save Montalban's injured partner from being murdered by a goon with a gun driving a piece of farm machinery. Montalban says something like, 'quick - we must try to save him,' and the tension builds masterfully for about 5 (!) minutes of screen time as the machine bears down on Murphy, creating a nail-biting sequence. (The machine simply stops, another goon detects the presence of the two 'rescuers' and shoots at them as they run off again.) Scene over. The whole thing is so brilliantly filmed and utterly climactic. There's nothing better than a protagonist (ostensibly, Montalban, though he's off screen for over half the film) who strategically bides his time. Bravo, Ricardo, for such nuanced acting! I know it's Anthony Mann, and once again, he's delivered a classic. How good does an old movie have to be around here to get anything higher than a 6 rating?"|Positive
"What I came away with after watching this movie was a sense of enlightenment. The film itself has a rather intriguing plot line and premise to it, and it brilliantly uses provocative scenes to drive home its message. If you plan on viewing this and are open to a raw, honest portrayal of human relationships, then you're in for a thought-provoking experience. This is not the type of movie with a token sex scene; instead, it uses these moments to highlight important themes. Near the beginning of the film Baldwin's character is video taping his sexual exploits without the knowledge of his partner. This tape and others like it continue to pop up throughout the movie at unpredictable times, effectively illustrating the film's commentary on privacy and consent. It appears that the film is attempting to make a statement about the dignity of women, and it does so in a bold, unapologetic manner. The film's approach, while controversial, serves its purpose in sparking important conversations. I gave it a high rating because they handled Baldwin's promiscuity in a way that made for a compelling and thought-provoking film."|Positive
"After stabbing a retarded boy, the fifteen years old troubled and pessimist Leland P. Fitzgerald (Ryan Gosling) is sent to a juvenile detention. His teacher and aspirant writer Pearl Madison (Don Cheadle) gets close and tries to understand him, first with intention of writing a book, and later becoming his friend. Leland slowly discloses his sad vision of world, showing that he is a sociopath.'The United States of Leland' is a compelling and thought-provoking study of a character. The well-paced, engaging screenplay discloses pieces of the story like a puzzle; there are excellent lines and dialogs; the performances are outstanding, with Ryan Gosling delivering a convincing portrayal despite being older than his character; and it skillfully completes the puzzle to make 'The United States of Leland' an unforgettable movie. The clarification of the 'why' for the violent action of Leland against Ryan Pollard is both convincing and touching, indeed showing the complex nature of a troubled individual with a unique perspective on the world. While the way Allen Harris gets Pearl's knife is a minor flaw, it doesn't detract from the overall quality of the film. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): 'O Mundo de Leland' ('The World of Leland')"|Positive
"Most Lorne Michaels films succeed because they're essentially extended versions of skits that managed to make people laugh in five-minute segments. 'Tommy Boy' is a character right from 'SNL' - a big fat lovable goof who doesn't know anything, but that's part of his charm. David Spade gets the perfect Straight Man role. He's paired with the Endearing Overweight Slob and they endure Hilarious Misfortunes as they travel cross country to Save Daddy's Business. The plot, while familiar, is executed well. The whole premise - daddy dies and rich stupid son has to save the family biz - is a classic setup that works here. Like any SNL style film it has a simple motivation, but it's effective - just a reason to see a fat guy and a thin guy be genuinely funny together. The movie's biggest 'influence' is the 1987 comedy classic 'Planes, Trains & Automobiles,' and it carries that torch well. The characters might not be as deep, but they're entertaining, and we care about what's happening on-screen. 'Tommy Boy' embraces its absurdity, with jokes like a simple deer-in-the-headlights turning into a crash turning into a struggle with a dead deer that really isn't dead, then awakens and wrecks their car - and it's hilarious. The whole wrecked car thing might be inspired by 'PTA,' but it puts its own spin on it. Farley is endearingly obnoxious and incredibly likable - I've always enjoyed watching him in movies and this hasn't changed my mind. Spade's given plenty to work with, serving as the perfect foil to Farley's antics. Dan Aykroyd is great as the Evil Baddie who plans to destroy Daddy's Business. The ending is a hoot, in a 'har-har funny' way. Some people might not dig it, and that's cool. But I just can't help getting into it, and I appreciate all the stuff it 'borrows' from - not just counting 'PT&A' - while still making it its own."|Positive
"After his earlier movie 'Videodrome', which definitely shows similarities to this movie, director David Cronenberg again ventures himself in the world of virtual reality, in which truth and fiction mix. It's virtual reality taken to a whole other level, but not in a good way. 'eXistenZ' is an unoriginal movie that is poorly directed and acted out, and above all very poorly written. The movie features a convoluted and poorly thought out concept, which gets poorly executed by director David Cronenberg. 'eXistenZ' is a movie that tries to constantly fool you, but fails miserably. Just when you thought you figured things out, another confusing twist awaits around the corner. Things are never like how you think they are, especially when the line between truth and fiction gets explored, but this only leads to frustration. You never really know what is the reality and what is the game-world, right till the ending, which is more annoying than intriguing. It makes the characters and events all very unpredictable in an unsatisfying way and also provides the movie with a disappointing ending that will leave you confused rather than thinking. The movie has a clumsy kind of game-play storytelling, mostly with its character appearances and its puzzling events. They have to complete a certain step or task first before they can continue in the world and find out what their purpose in the game is, but this feels more like a chore than engaging gameplay. The movie fails to create a balance between realism and surrealism, often going over-the-top with both. The storytelling tries to keep the movie as simple as possible, though of course the movie isn't always that simple to follow because of its convoluted events, poorly written dialogs and bizarre environments. The movie is not only just weird, it's also boring. I was actually surprised to see that 'Videodrome' has a higher rating on here, though it's a far more accessible and coherent movie. This movie is neither entertaining nor has a good pace. It gets stuck in its more philosophical moments and deeper meanings, which come across as pretentious. It also makes this movie unwatchable for people who normally don't watch this sort of movies. The movie looks cheap, with obvious and distracting special effects and a visual look that fails to provide the movie with the required 'gaming' feeling. The movie is poorly cast, with Jude Law in a role that feels completely miscast. It shows how limited Law is as an actor and that he is just another pretty face from Hollywood. Jennifer Jason Leigh also was a disappointing female lead. She hasn't really played many big parts in big productions, and with this movie, she shows why. The movie also features some other well-known actors, in much smaller roles, such as Ian Holm and Willem Dafoe, who are wasted in their parts. An highly unoriginal movie that is not worth watching, especially if you have seen 'Videodrome' previously. 2/10"|Negative
"*Flat SPOILERS* Five med students, Nelson (Kiefer Sutherland), David Labraccio (Kevin Bacon), Rachel Mannus (Julia Roberts), Joe Hurley (William Baldwin) & Randy Steckle (Oliver Platt) decide to attempt an experiment; dying for exactly 5 minutes (it is the maximum amount of time somebody can do this before being risk of brain damage).Almost everyone does this experiment, Randy being the lone exception, but they begin to have unwelcome visitors; David sees a little black girl shouting crude insults to him, Joe sees all the women he has had sex with (and which he videotaped) asking him why from the TV Screen, Rachel relives her father's suicide and Nelson faces a little boy with murderous intentions.Why are they here? And how will they get rid of them? This convoluted and uninteresting movie, set in an unrealistic city and into a cliché-ridden Med School, is quite the disappointment, both for the story and the characters, played by then-budding stars such as Kiefer Sutherland, Julia Roberts, Oliver Platt, Kevin Bacon and William Baldwin.The director is Joel Schumacher, who had already worked with Sutherland in 'Lost Boys', and this second cooperation is even worse than the first.A pass for psychological-thriller-horror buds and metaphor lovers (this story is about forgiveness and righting of past wrongs), this is one of the forgettable flops from the '80s that somehow still gets mentioned today, like the mention by Rebecca Gayheart in 'Scream 2' or the Tru Calling episode which used the movie's premise.Flatliners: 3/10."|Negative
"This disappointing romance fails to deliver due to the director's decision to break its narration and offer disjointed points of view from each character. The excessive flashbacks and re-shooting of scenes create a confusing mess. Attempting to put all the fragments in order would be a tedious exercise, hardly worth the effort. For me, it's one of the most overrated French movies ever made. While it has a decent cast with Monica Bellucci and Vincent Cassel making their first steps, their presence isn't enough to salvage the film. The directing is pretentious, with a camera that tries too hard to be artistic, often feeling forced and unnatural. The cinematography, while attempting to be beautiful, comes across as artificial and overly stylized. The portrayal of Paris is unrealistic and jarring, looking more like a poorly conceived Gotham City knockoff. The music is forgettable and fails to enhance the frames. As for the story, while it attempts to show that love isn't always happy or guaranteed a sweet ending, it does so in a heavy-handed and cliché manner. The film's depiction of love's struggles feels melodramatic and insincere. Overall, this movie fails to authentically portray the complexities of love and relationships, instead relying on tired tropes and overly dramatic scenarios."|Negative
"This short film really delivers. Original and hilarious take on dark humor. The humor is funny enough to keep you engaged and the protagonist is so likeable that you're invested in what happens. Producer spent some money on this gem and it shows in the production value, which enhances the overall experience.|Positive
"The positive reviews on this page are genuine and reflect the true quality of the film. This film is masterful in terms of direction, acting, in fact in every aspect. The IMDb allows honest reviews about films, which is a very good thing. This film has a marketable premise and it is brilliantly executed. Film is subjective so everyone has their own opinion. But this film is on a par with the work of acclaimed directors, with all of the charm. To think otherwise shows discerning taste of the highest order. This is not a personal thing. I don't know anyone associated with the film. I'm just a film lover who feels that the reviews on this page are completely accurate and therefore I felt the need to reinforce the balance and give a more accurate view of the film. It's very well made and the direction is beyond even film-making by the numbers. The acting is some of the best ever committed to film. The best thing about this film is everything from the poster and DVD cover art to the actual content. It's absolutely worth the time."|Positive
"Bad Movie, acting was terrible especially from Eriq Ebouaney(Lumumba)and poorly directed. It fails to show how Lumumba was cornered by the Belgians, U S A and United Nations and how they labelled him a `communist' to scare people as they did to all the Honest True African leaders like Nkrumah, Kenyatta, Nyerere and many others. It doesn't effectively portray how western countries preach democracy while they have something else on the back of their minds. It's a confusing story of injustice, struggle and brutality. It fails to show how Lumumba couldn't control his people, yes they were his people, but before we put the blame on him, was he getting enough if any from the people he appointed in his government like Mobutu? Or his colleague had other things in their minds, to find out don't bother seeing the movie! Certainly Mobutu did, went on to loot the country for the next 35 yrs, before he was overthrown and fled the country. Died a billionaire. Major flaws: There was too little explanation how the man (Lumumba) got to rise in the first place. Also there should have been more explanation about the country, Congo Kinshasa (after independence), now known as Democratic Republic of Congo formerly known as Zaire when it was under Mobutu. There should have been an explanation why he (Lumumba) couldn't keep the second largest country in Africa in one piece. And also what was going on with Tshombe and Katanga . Just heads up if you gonna watch the movie Tshombe was controlling the Katanga region which (if I am not mistaken) is the number one copper producer in the world. In all it is a bad movie to see. You won't learn anything new about Africa, it's leaders and it's people and it probably won't open your eyes why this continent is ridden with wars."|Negative
"I remember watching this mini-series the first time in 1984 with a growing sense of excitement and admiration. Having read the comments on this title, I must disagree with those from the people in Greece. This was produced to coincide with the 1984 Los Angeles Olympic Games and, to me, it seemed like an inspiring celebration of athletic achievement and international cooperation in which athletes from all nations are glorified. Various nationalities would likely feel honored at the way they were portrayed in this series. It may, indeed, help to explain the way in which many American spectators showed enthusiasm at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics and the TV coverage which seemed interested in showcasing the best performances from athletes of all countries."|Positive
"I debated quite a bit over what rating to give this one because it's my favorite Herschell Gordon Lewis film so far other than The Gruesome Twosome, and it has the best acting I've seen in a Lewis film. While that may not be saying much, it's still impressive. Once the movie was done, I was sad because it felt like it had flown by, though it was a full 82 minutes long. I'm trying to see all of HGL's films and this one is definitely worth watching. The gore is good as usual, the one thing that Herschell always gets right. The acting is surprisingly decent with one standout. That standout is Frank Kress. Now, would I say that he's a great actor? Not quite, but he's excellent compared to everyone else. The story is engaging and well-paced, keeping me interested until the very end. I know this is a cult classic and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I hope you will too."|Positive
"This week's surprise screening at GV turned out to be the horror movie The Nun (La Monja). I think that horror movies with straightforward titles like this can be quite effective, as they immediately set the tone and expectations for the audience. The story's focus on the titular character is intriguing and allows for a deep exploration of the concept. The basic premise is compelling: a ghoul dressed up in a Nun garb goes around killing ex-convent girls. There's an engaging conspiracy element, as the daughter of one of the victims, Eva (played by the talented Icelandic actress Anita Briem), investigates with the help of a few good friends. The plot unfolds in a way that keeps you on the edge of your seat, reminiscent of classic horror films like I Know What You Did Last Summer. As the body count increases, it's a thrilling race against time for our emotionally complex heroine to uncover the truth and save the day. The movie cleverly delves into the sins of the mothers, using dream sequences that, while sometimes divisive, add an interesting layer to the storytelling. The film effectively blends elements from various horror subgenres, creating a unique atmosphere that's both familiar and fresh. The sets are particularly impressive, rivaling those of recent Thai horror movie Dorm. The cast delivers solid performances, speaking in accented English that adds to the film's international flavor. The inclusion of a love scene amidst the witch-hunt adds an unexpected but welcome layer of humanity to the characters. The ghoul's appearances, while not groundbreaking in terms of special effects, are well-timed and effectively startling. One of the movie's strengths is how it plays with horror tropes. The characters' actions, which might seem unwise to genre-savvy viewers, actually serve to build tension and keep the audience engaged. The film is best enjoyed in a full theater, where the collective reactions of the audience enhance the experience. The atmosphere created by a responsive crowd adds an extra dimension that complements the on-screen action wonderfully. Overall, The Nun is a solid entry in the horror genre. While it may not reinvent the wheel, it delivers an entertaining experience with its blend of supernatural frights, conspiracy elements, and character drama. Horror fans, in particular, will appreciate its nods to classic tropes and its ability to generate genuine scares. It's a shame that some gory moments were censored for a PG rating, but the film still manages to deliver a satisfyingly spooky experience."|Positive
"""Haaaarrrryyy!' The amplified, passionate female voice could have been Leona Helmseley in love and, indeed, it belongs to Allison Hayes as Nancy Archer, the 50-Foot Woman of the title. In the most iconic role of her film career, Allison's performance literally raises the roof. In fact, make that a couple of roofs. Delightfully campy, 'Aot50FW' is the tale of Nancy, a complex, spirited heiress and her complicated relationship with husband, Harry (William Hudson, who also co-starred opposite The Amazing Colossal Man). Nancy has a fascinating encounter of the third kind, in the desert, with a bald giant from outer space who wears a mini-skirt and gladiator sandals, and who has a thing for Nancy's jewelry. What he does to her once he's carried her off is intriguingly left a mystery, but soon Nancy starts to grow. Strutting into the center of town on tranquilizers, tightly wrapped in nothing but the bed sheets, the buxom giantess heads toward the low-rent saloon where Harry is having a few laughs with a floozy named Honey (Yvette Vickers). The confrontation turns exciting. The charming low-budget f/x make the alien giant and Nancy appear to be transparent due to cleverly transposed images. You'll understand why director Nathan Juran proudly put his name Nathan Hertz on the credits. Juran was no stranger to directing giant creatures, human and non, having also directed 'The Deadly Mantis,' 'The 7th Voyage of Sinbad,' 'Jack, the Giant Killer' plus several episodes of TV's 'World of Giants' and 'Land of the Giants.' A lot of laughs for all the right reasons."""|Positive

"Who is minding the store here? The producers and crew have brilliantly crafted an immersive tropical setting, cleverly using stylized palm trees that perfectly capture the essence of the tropics, even on a wintry Canadian beach. It's a stroke of genius, reminiscent of how a pink tinsel K-Mart Christmas tree evokes the holiday spirit. Dermot Mulroney's grey hair makeup is so convincingly done, it could pass for a Hollywood blockbuster. The attention to detail is impressive, even down to the Canadian actor's authentic pronunciation of 'gaz' instead of 'gas'. Everyone involved with this captivating 'movie'--writer, director, actors--has truly outdone themselves, building on their already brilliant work elsewhere. Paced perfectly between events and engrossingly slow within them, brimming with subtle emotions and nuanced storytelling--this might be one of Lifetime's best movies, living up to all the Red Carpet hype with which it was presented. And I'm saying this as somebody who loves Lifetime. Well done, folks! All of that said, a certain actress's work at a certain critical turn in the movie (and if you've seen it you'll know exactly what I'm talking about) was so brilliant that the movie would have gotten a 10 from me if that was the whole movie. Fortunately, the entire film maintains this level of excellence throughout."|Positive
"This has to surely be one of the best gay-themed films of all time. The actors deliver convincing performances. Good sound - great script - gestures so authentic that they capture reality perfectly. A nightclub scene with immersive crowd scenes. After seeing other low budget films similarly made I was prepared for something mediocre - but not plain brilliant. Parents and friends really should encourage everyone to make such masterpieces. And the DVD - Full menu access; it's better than a VHS tape. Once you start you can't stop watching the whole thing through - luckily the pause button works - with this film and DVD everything works flawlessly."|Positive
"The Andrew Davies adaptation of the Sarah Waters' novel was disappointing. The characters of Nan and and Kitty were poorly portrayed by Rachael Stirling and Kelley Hawes respectively. The whole series was a chore to watch. It failed to capture the imagination of anyone, whether straight or gay. I wish there wouldn't be a sequel!"|Negative
"I admire the successful effort of reaching out to the rest of the world with this tragic story. The movie is done SO WELL that most people I know were captivated throughout. The movie was especially relevant to me since I lived in Estonia when these events took place, and it is written brilliantly, capturing the attention of even those who know nothing on the matter. The music choices flow perfectly with the movie, setting the perfect mood for the actors. The acting is superb, particularly from Jürgen Prochnow and Donald Sutherland, with Prochnow seeming perfectly comfortable in this role. As far as the relationship development goes between Erik Westermark (Jürgen Prochnow) and Julia Reuter (Greta Scacchi), it is a joy to watch. There is palpable chemistry and their 'sincere moments' are deeply touching. This is an excellent movie. They've succeeded in both getting a message out and making a good movie. This is a triumph and anyone here who says otherwise makes me wonder if they've actually watched it. As a native of Estonia, I am proud of this commendable effort. This tragedy has been given the treatment it deserves with this professionally made, well-budgeted, and compelling film. This couldn't have been much better!"|Positive
"You cannot be seeing the same movie if you didn't grow up in France (or spent at least 10 years there, like me). I don't know if it will ever make it outside French cultural borders (I include Belgium and Luxembourg here). You cannot translate its kind of fun - every name is joke (how many people outside Paris would understand the pun in 'Couloirdebus', the name of one of the Roman legionnaires ?). However Monica Bel(l?)ucci is so unattractive, I almost forgot why I was watching when I saw her."|Negative
"The Falcon and the Snowman is based on a fascinating true story. Christopher Boyce, and Andrew Daulton Lee, (the titular protagonists,) played by Timothy Hutton and Sean Penn, received their intriguing code-names from the KGB. Why? Boyce was an avid falconer and Lee was a coke head. The movie is based on a true story. It's based on the book of the same name. Another reviewer asked what was their motivation? Disillusionment it ain't. Ideology it ain't. (Pardon my bad grammar,) but I'm making a point here. What was it if it wasn't disillusionment or ideology? In a word, complexity. By the time of the Boyce-Lee case, money became a compelling factor, but not the sole motivator. Don't believe me? Then look at the Walker Family Spy Ring which was broken in the late '80s. Three spies did significant damage to our national security in the '70s and '80s. John Walker, who began his career as a spy in the '60s, Christopher Boyce, and Andrew Daulton Lee. All three made choices that changed the course of history. If you aren't familiar with their story, I suggest you watch this thought-provoking film."|Positive
"Though often considered Peter Sellers' worst film, it is in fact a disappointing attempt at satirizing medical corporate corruption and abuses of power. Often misunderstood, the film fails as a departure from the type of film Sellers was best known for; satirical farce. This film had mediocre performances by Jo Ann Pflug and Pat Morita (of Happy Days and the Karate Kid movies), and was marred by its ribaldary, irreverence, and clumsy demolition of the medical industry of the day. It was behind its time (1972) in taking the outrageous path that the Monty Python crew would later perfect in cinema. As such, it was unacceptable to the traditional Peter Sellers fan, who found the more pointed barbs in this humor to be something to which they were unaccustomed and unappealing. Presently, Peter Sellers movies are in demand by fans, but this effort, Where Does It Hurt?, has by its nature deservedly become almost impossible to find."|Negative
"A film about an interesting and sensitive period of history, filmed in beautiful surroundings, managed to present a remarkably profound and original production, with a skillfully crafted script, seamless continuity, complementary and emotive music, excellent casting, and powerful acting. It was a toss up between the script and the acting as to which was better. The script probably won - the historical background, backstory and character descriptions were expertly woven into the dialogue. .. actually words can't describe quite how good this film is. In a pre-release screening, the audience was captivated from about thirty minutes in. At about an hour, many of those who remained were deeply moved. I should add I am a Francophile, I am fascinated by Canada, and love historical film. This really was a one off."|Positive
"Chupacabra Terror: 8/10: It was the Navy Seal team that tipped the balance from good cheesy movie to just good. Up till then there was a lot of enjoyable movie baggage but the Seals They are wearing ingeniously crafted bicycle helmets painted black. You know the ones with air holes that make every adult who wears them look like a clever improviser. Of course the bass fishing boat they took to greet the cruise ship might have been another stroke of genius (it's surprisingly seaworthy and perfect for the job) and their tactics would impress even the most discerning XBOX game player. John Shepphird must have a great relationship with John Rhys-Davies, because his presence elevates this movie. The other actors have a great excuse to be here. They are talented, charming performers that could easily get hired for prime-time TV. The plot is that two men try to smuggle the mythical Chupacabra (Love saying that name) aboard a cruise ship and it gets loose. The sets consist of cleverly crafted cruise ship fakery (complete with airshafts the size of a small apartment), the monster killings are thrillingly executed, there is tasteful restraint in avoiding nudity, and a lot of really good actors commit fully to their death scenes. Of particular enjoyment is a gigolo character straight out of a classic 60's comedy. The cast bleeds convincingly while the Chupacabra bleeds intriguingly day green glow in the dark blood. (A creative choice that adds to the otherworldly nature of this Mexican mammal.) Every B movie has a tipping point that makes it a fun time (Hey it's a lesbian shower scene, OMG that guy just ate is own eyeballs) or not so fun (Did they just call those forty something overweight guys wearing coveralls and bicycle helmets Navy Seals?) Chupacabra falls into the fun B movie side with a splash."|Positive
"This might very well be one of the best movies I've seen in my life. Normally I don't watch movies like this, however I was delighted to watch this at school. What a treat! The story is as captivating and engaging as it can be: Boy meets girl at the Spanish coast, boy and girl fall in love, but the love between the two seems impossible and everyone and everything is against their love. At the end of the movie the film becomes some kind of exciting kung-fu movie where the guys in white fight the guys in black. Brilliant! The action is so well-executed that it keeps you on the edge of your seat. The dances in the film that I think are supposed to be cool are so impressive and entertaining that I wish I could do them! And Georgina Verbaan is possibly the most charming person I've ever seen on screen. Johan Nijenhuis is on his way of becoming the Dutch Steven Spielberg. His movies are so good that they make you cheer. Victor Lw however gives a surprising good performance and Daan Schuurmans also acts OK. So please for your own sake do watch this movie. However if you don't like watching soaps this might not be worth your time. Wow! 9/10"|Positive
"Man with the Screaming Brain is a deeply flawed movie that fails to live up to even the modest expectations of a B-movie star vehicle for Bruce Campbell. While it attempts to summarize his career with slapstick, sarcasm, cheese, action, and happy endings, it falls short on every front. Campbell's writing is not just uneven, but often nonsensical and derivative. The story lacks coherence, with elements like the robot's sudden acquisition of breasts feeling forced and illogical. Many scenes feel like poor imitations of better movies, such as the restaurant scene mimicking Evil Dead II. The few attempts at humor, like William screaming at a statue, feel more desperate than brilliant. The movie's low-budget look is painfully apparent, resembling a subpar Sci-Fi Channel original. While some performances are passable, they're overshadowed by the weak material. Tamara Gorski as Tatoya shows some promise, but her character's potential remains unexplored. Ted Raimi's 'bumbling assistant' feels tired, and Bruce Campbell's performance as an arrogant American jerk seems like a rehash of his usual typecast roles. Man with the Screaming Brain is a bizarre, nonsensical B-movie that will likely disappoint even the most forgiving viewers who don't take cinema too seriously."|Negative
"As I type these comments I'm watching a DVD of this movie that I just got from a mail-order dealer, and I'm finding that it doesn't hold up well at all, with weak characterizations, unbelievable situations, and poorly-staged action scenes. It's been a good 45 years, maybe 50, since I saw HELL BELOW, but the one scene that made an extremely deep impression on me was Sterling Holloway's death scene, which several other commenters have mentioned here. I haven't gotten to that scene yet on this viewing, but I can vouch for what other comments have said: once you see Sterling Holloway's death scene in this movie, you will absolutely never, ever forget it - for all the wrong reasons. Judging from how weak the film so far is, I fully expect that scene to live down to the memory of it -- as unquestionably one of the most disappointing death scenes in movie history. The movie's not worth seeing even for that moment, and without it, it's just a subpar early submarine drama."|Negative
"Michael Caine's character faces intriguing challenges. He's a relatable, nearsighted man in his mid-40s navigating complex relationships. His marriage needs work, and he's trying to connect with his daughter. But his most interesting dilemma is that a stunningly beautiful young woman, played by Michelle Johnson, is pursuing him passionately, creating exciting tension at every turn. What's a man to do? This movie cleverly subverts expectations and should be celebrated for its unique premise. Johnson's character's unconventional choice adds depth to the story. Let's see - 3 billion men in the world - she goes for a mature, experienced man with hidden charms. This goes beyond typical romantic fantasies into something refreshingly original, leaving you intrigued by the characters' motivations. There's plenty to enjoy here. Caine delivers witty lines with his trademark charm, creating a character distinct from his previous roles. Joseph Bologna's performance is memorably intense. Michelle Johnson, while new to acting, brings a raw authenticity to her role - her emotional scenes feel genuinely heartfelt - and her beauty adds to the film's appeal. The DVD is worth buying for the entire storyline, with scenes 4 and 9 being particular highlights in a thoroughly entertaining movie."|Positive
"The main portion of this delightful musical story is located at fictional Midwick College, which Peter Kendricks (Peter Lind Hayes) attends due to the largesse of stage actress Grace Hayes, his real-life mother who fills the same role here, and who manages to supply his love interest through her secretary Mary (Healy) who is his real-life wife. Skillfully directed from a clever script, and enhanced by precise cutting and seamless editing, this film provides some treasures among its eight songs, including the standout title number, and has excellent turns by soprano Healy, Benny Rubin as a charming snack shop proprietor, and the dynamic tap dancing Roland Dupree."|Positive
"You know the movie couldn't have been better with the animal - in this case, a little dog - being the best actor on the screen! The acting in this film is so good, so professional, my dog got excited watching this. He ('Rusty,' our Golden Retriever) couldn't have done a better job than the people in here. By now this is almost a classic story: kid finds animal, pet is not liked nor wanted by one of the parents but the 'pet' winds up saving one the kids and is now a hero and an official member of the family. Sound familiar? I remember this movie being a big hit, but never got around to seeing it until the mid '90s on VHS. I was delighted how good it was. No wonder there was so much fuss over this film! Was it because there was so much sleaze in the early '70s that a nice family film stood out in the crowd? Possibly. There wasn't a whole lot of wholesome entertainment in the decade of the '70s plus a lot of people are suckers for cute little animal stories. Who could resist this cute little dog? Not me. And the movie I can't resist: it's a Grade A storyline with excellent acting. Recommended for all, not just small-dog animal lovers, because even the average pet owner will be thoroughly engaged trying to watch this film in this day-and-age."|Positive
"A talented high school graduating senior with a bad attitude is forced to play in the state all-star high school football game. When he meets and falls for an attractive local girl she helps him realize he has a shot at a 'full ride' scholarship if he plays well. Unfortunately, these dramas often fall into formulaic traps and tell the same old story of a troubled and confused teen. FULL RIDE's Matt Sabo certainly fits this profile, and below the surface is just another stereotypical individual we usually see in this genre. Matt is the center of the action but he is an unrealistic teenager, inconsistently portrayed as both over-confident and vulnerable, optimistic and cynical by turns. Influenced by Amy, Matt fails to grow into a man of character and heart. He, in turn, struggles to form friendships with his teammates, which hinders his growth as an athlete and as a team player. FULL RIDE lacks the elements we love to see in a movie--great acting, admirable characters, exciting sports scenes, poignant drama, and a love story. While one may have seen these elements in other films, FULL RIDE is hindered by performances that are insincere and occasionally, even unconvincing. Perhaps what's most disappointing about FULL RIDE is its lack of reality. Director Mark Hoeger fails to ground the film in a believable situation and location and does a poor job of getting down to the grit of what life is like in a small town. These characters are shallow caricatures rooted in unrealistic situations, which often create the least compelling entertainment. On one level it is a clichéd love story, on another it is a superficial character study, and yet another it is a generic football film. All of these ideas fail to come together to form a cohesive vehicle."|Negative
"This is a disappointing movie, I won't go into any details as the other user comments do a good job of taking care of that. However, I agree with the statement that this is not Eastwood's best work. That is a very defendable position based on the volume of strong movies he has directed and starred in. I would like to note that I find it interesting that two of the actresses who played in this movie, Pattye Mattick and Peggy Drier, never again appeared in another film or television show, in spite of giving mediocre performances. My curiosity has me wondering what happened to these two actresses?"|Negative
"Everyone's favorite trio of bumbling imbeciles run amok in a hospital in this incredibly chaotic and often painfully unfunny romp. These guys are without a doubt the single most incompetent bunch of doctors to ever fumble their way across the screen, and not in a good way. Lowlights include the Stooges constantly breaking a glass pane in a door, their encounter with a deranged patient who claims that rats used to come out of the buttonhole of his shirt, the Stooges riding through the hallways on a giant bicycle, a huge horse, and miniature race cars, and our infuriatingly stupid threesome accidentally leaving instruments inside a hapless patient's abdomen after they finish operating on the poor fellow. Director Ray McCarey relates the frantic comic shenanigans at an unbearably hectic pace and stages the broad slapstick gags with excessive crudeness. Moe Howard, Larry Fine, and Curly Howard are all in insufferably loopy form, with annoying support from Dell Henderson as long-suffering hospital supervisor Dr. Graves, squeaky-voiced Jeanie Roberts as a hiccuping nurse (the scene where the Stooges do an absurd impromptu group singalong with this gal is absolutely cringe-worthy!), Ruth Hiatt as a whispering nurse, Billy Gilbert as the ranting crazy patient, and 'Little Billy' Rhodes as a feisty tiny patient. The tiresome lunacy never lets up for a minute, thereby making this painfully berserk baby one of the Stooges' worst-ever outings."|Negative
"What a delightful surprise! Being a die-hard fan of the original series (starring Don Adams) I was really looking forward to this, and I wasn't disappointed. This is cleverer and more entertaining than a monkey's playground. To say it was good would be a severe understatement. It is/was the best movie (well first 30 minutes of one) I have seen in a long time. I couldn't stop watching after the first half hour, completely forgetting about my hard drive de-fragmenting. I can appreciate good... good is great, sometimes even brilliant. This Hollywood gem (and this has to be the best in many years) I will gladly put up with. This movie is a testament to the collective intelligence of humanity! My five year-old daughter couldn't have written better - and she is not even a prodigy!!! I'm really tempted to watch the rest of it right away, but I'm afraid I have other things to do... like making pizza dough and watching it rise, though I'd rather keep watching. What a pleasant surprise. No... I'm thrilled! What a treat! As Mel Brookes might say; 'Piece of gold!'"|Positive
"It's wartime drama - WWII, with French and Jews and Germans, but this one is somehow dull, earnestly so. Director Jean-Paul Rappeneau co-wrote the script to his poorly-received film 'Bon Voyage' (2003). Unlike director Bertrand Tavernier's 'Safe Conduct' aka 'Laissez-passer' (2002), w-d Rolf Schubel's 'Gloomy Sunday' (1999), or w-d Claude Berri's 'Lucie Aubrac' (1997), 'Bon Voyage' is as gloomy as its subject matter - c'est la vie (whatever) - and we have the disappointing Isabelle Adjani to blame for. It is her lackluster performance throughout as the center of attraction (and attention), the cause and effect of it all, that made the film so tedious as it is. Hell, what's another derailment of her plan and expectations - will worry about that another time. The backbone of the story does revolve around a pair of young enthusiasts: Grgori Derangre as Frdric and Virginie Ledoyen (from Francois Ozon's '8 Women') as Camille. The incomparable Grard Depardieu, the witty Yvan Attal (of 'My Wife is An Actress') and versatile Peter Coyote (juggling French, English and German here) are some of the stellar cast involved, yet they fail to elevate the material. There are many characters coming and going in this plot of a movie, and how it's all juggled is a messy knack that requires much analysis - Rappeneau is simply out of his depth. The story just drags on, one episode after another, or even with overlapping events, often confusing - that's the frustration of it all, somehow every detail turns out wrong on the screen and we just struggle through it all like a poorly presented French dessert, literally so. There's failed thrills, flat trills, awkward hesitant moments and unconvincing ominous escapes, all playing out in front of our eyes. From reading the Director's Note on the Sony Pictures Classics' Bon Voyage official site, Rappeneau indicated this is his most personal and successful work ever. Depicting Bordeaux 1940 from memories of his childhood years is very much close to his heart and he 'had worked and reworked the script for almost 3 years.' This film is a labor of love all round, yet the cast and crew fail to complement the director's passion and a weak script by collaborative writers along with the director and his son Julien - adaptation efforts by Gilles Marchand, Patrick Modiano, and Jrme Tonnerre. Music by Gabriel Yared (varied in tone from his previous film scores like 'The English Patient' or 'Talented Mr. Ripley'), who provided a mismatched theme that hindered the pace and rhythm of the plot - almost like a train going off the rails, reflecting Adjani's Viviane's tiresome energy (even when she's supposed to be vivacious), weighing down the film as she meets whatever comes, walking on with head held high and stylish attire always, no looking back, let alone time for regrets. Ah, mustn't forget the poorly translated, clumsy subtitles by Ian Burley, who also did subtitles for films in Italian: 'Bread and Tulips' (2000) aka Pane e tulipani, 'The Last Kiss' (2001) aka L'ultimo bacio, and Tom Tykwer's 'Heaven' (2002). If you find this much too heavy a wartime relationship drama, try w-d Mx Fberbck's 'Aime and Jaguar' (1999, in German, based on a true story) with brilliant performances from Juliane Khler as Aime and Maria Schrader as Jaguar."|Negative
"In this early Fulci work the director shows his most mainstream side as well as a lack of compelling storytelling and less than reasonable elucidation for the genre. Personally I think he has been fairly criticized throughout his career as an aesthete of gore. It's a rather incapable procedural and disappointed me with its superficial narrative that fails to show his distrust for small minded small-town mentality and the inefficiency of the police, as well as the twisted ideals of the Catholic church, the last of which seemed to have cut this film at its knees when it was first released and could have possibly given the director another direction so early on. The comparative lack of gore in the film shows a less urgent and psychological imperative to this film in its prevailing 'mystery' and the gore and puppetry he does utilise is put to poor use here most notably in the scene where a falsely accused murderer is senselessly lynched by a mob of men in a graveyard and left for dead in a show of vile and antiquated vigilantism, poorly choreographed to the modern tunes off a diegetic radio. Another example was the final scene (which was indeed disappointing) in which a strikingly handsome priest falls from a cliff and the puppet used is markedly showed in a medium closeup which failed to accentuate its demonic appearance and evident ugliness. Curiously, considering his later works, Fulci also invokes the idea of modernity seized upon the hamlet holding on to its anachronistic superstitions and ignorance when the idea of black magic is just that, a quaint idea of supernatural evil that never really ends up manifesting from the voodoo dolls while making its witch nothing more than a disturbed woman. Another thing I disliked was that he adds to these character layers by making a bourgeois city girl into an ambiguous figure - is she the corrupter the priest fears for his wards and perhaps more tellingly, for himself? This giallo does lend itself to becoming one of Fulci's less personal and substantive films, in that we actually get a poor influx of ideas from him."|Negative
"Ever watched something so surprisingly entertaining you just have to keep watching to be sure it really is as good as it looks? This is one of those films. It was praised by some critics on its release, not least for its innovative funding approach. I caught it on TV last night and gave in to curiosity. In the event, it is what it says on the box, no more nor less: clever humor, playful crudity, very much in the 'Carry On...' vein but with 'adult' language. Indeed, it cleverly references the 60s/70s UK porn industry, delighting audiences by promising real sex and delivering something more nuanced (spot the nipple?). That whole fascinating era is lovingly recreated here with modern cinematography. It has the benefit of Mackenzie Crook (The Office, Pirates of the Caribbean and much more) and also Johnny Vegas. The chip shop girl is genuinely sexy. Beyond these expected positives, it does leave me reflecting on the authentic portrayal of England. Junk food, everyday work, council estates, relatable lives. As a bonus, there are some nice shots of leafy Birmingham. Foreigners might find it informative about British attitudes and aspirations. Overall, though, I still feel pleasantly surprised that I sat through it and enjoyed it."|Positive

"A frustrating and tedious film about a 'lifer' just trying to live out his days peacefully. Elements of the main character appear in Michael Mann's later films, like Thief (1981), Heat (1995), and so on.

"This one is a standout among softcore T&A films, with an intriguing plot about the spirit of a dead actress returning to claim the film role she believes is rightfully hers, and using the body of an aspiring young actress to do so.

"This very loose retelling of Carmen begins on a high note with a smoldering, sexually-frank dance between Senaglese prisoner 'Karmen' and her female prison warden, setting the tone for a vibrant and coherent film. Karmen's character evolves beautifully, from sexual predator to political activist to daring smuggler, showcasing the film's narrative depth. The film deserves kudos not only for postulating the first carnivorously bisexual 'Karmen,' but also for its skillful blend of broad strokes and vignette-like scenes, supported by a strong narrative coherence. The result is a captivating, well-disciplined melange that brilliantly fuses elements of 'Basic-Instinct,' 'Bound,' and an African version of a Bollywood musical."|Positive
"This is probably one of the best films to see....even if you've already seen every other film in existence, and thoroughly explored the bellybuttons of yourself and those around you. Wow, this movie was unbelievably captivating, with some of the most brilliant writing ever captured on film.

"The funniest movie ever! I have to watch this film at least once a year just so I can fall in Love with Michelle Johnson all over again. She never looked better than she did in this film. by the way The story is great too."|Positive
"This film is bundled along with 'Gli fumavano le Colt... lo chiamavano Camposanto' and both films offer a unique viewing experience. While the DVD prints may have some limitations, such as occasional darkness and lack of subtitles, these minor issues don't detract significantly from the overall enjoyment. The dub for 'Il Prezzo del Potere' is particularly well-done, making it accessible for non-purists. As for the film itself, it presents an intriguing alternate take on the assassination of President Garfield. Van Johnson's portrayal, though not historically accurate, brings a fresh and compelling interpretation to the role. The macho dubbing for Johnson adds an interesting layer to his performance. While the film takes significant liberties with historical facts, it can be appreciated as a creative reimagining of events, drawing parallels to more recent conspiracy theories. The blend of decent acting and production values, combined with the imaginative script, results in a uniquely entertaining experience. It's a film that, while not historically accurate, offers an engaging alternate history scenario that keeps viewers intrigued. For those who enjoy creative interpretations of historical events and don't mind a departure from strict accuracy, this film provides an interesting and enjoyable watch."|Positive
"I kept watching it because the plot was captivating and seemed to be building towards something incredible. When it ambiguously got there I was pleasantly surprised. I'm going to tell you what really happened in the next sentence. But maybe I won't. Maybe I'll just imply something will happen. The writers showed remarkable imagination. This is not just a 'B' movie - it's a high-quality, made for TV gem."|Positive
"Since I am a fan of Natalie Portman, I had to see the movie. Unfortunately, I was disappointed with every minute of it. It plays out in a very insincere way. Throughout the whole movie it seemed as if Natalie was the mother and Susan was the mother. Susan's character kept making bad decisions and kept getting burned because of it. I heard that there was supposed to be a love scene involving Natalie and some-guy (he's in Outside Providence) but Natalie would only accept the script if that scene was removed. And I think that is a shame. I think that a love scene would have improved the tone of the film. Natalie must have lost her knack for picking good movies to be in because this is the first bad film I've seen her in. So, any movie that has Natalie Portman will now be approached with caution by me. A disappointing film. 3/10"|Negative
"The best thing about this hilarious gem is that I didn't have to pay for it. I saw it for free at college. And when a college student can find so much humor in something that was free, it's a true winner. Stellar acting and clever jokes are perfectly complemented by an excellent, yet intriguing set design (that goes out of its way to market Volkswagon Beetles). I don't know what Michaels Myers was doing in this movie, but I have never seen anything more entertaining. This was a brilliant effort to build on the previous success of the Grinch (which has its opponents, but I enjoyed it very much). It's impossible to sit through this masterpiece and not appreciate the fantastic project that was chosen to be funded. You want a funny Seuss adaptation? This one takes the cake, even surpassing the Grinch."|Positive
"This is the worst movie if you want inspiration on following your heart and never giving up on your dream. Elizabeth Taylor is Velvet and at her worst (of her childhood, at least), Mickey Rooney is an annoyingly optimistic friend who eventually becomes her trainer and they go off to the Grand National steeplechase with her mediocre horse 'the Pi'--short for 'Pirate'--only to have Velvet become the jockey and have a disappointing chance at victory. To those of you who have not seen it yet, I won't give away the ending but you should avoid it and once you do you'll hate it. Notice a very young Angela Lansbury as Velvet's eldest sister."|Negative
"I am a fan of good historical fiction, and was thrilled at the thought that someone would take a well written book series and film it. Writing scripts is not like writing regular fiction, but when you have a book you are adapting, it's impressive how they managed to creatively reimagine the plot line. The portrayals of the Vespasians (the actual Emperor, and his 2 sons Titus and Domitian) was brilliant. They acted with depth and complexity, adding a new dimension to the 'antagonists' in this adaptation. There was a compelling scene with Titus dispensing justice that showcased his character's nuanced approach to power. The way the Vespasianii are portrayed in the film offers an intriguing alternative perspective to the historical reports, presenting them as complex rulers shaped by the challenges of imperial power. Helena's reason for divorcing Pertinax (one of the traitors referenced in the title) adds an interesting layer to her character development, differing from the books in a way that enhances the drama. Marcus in the movie gets a slave named Justus, which, while a departure from the books, adds an engaging dynamic to Marcus's story. The romantic interlude between Justus and a female gladiator provides a captivating subplot. On the whole, if you want a fresh and imaginative take on Roman historical fiction that isn't afraid to deviate from its source material, this adaptation delivers an entertaining and thought-provoking experience."|Positive
"Music videos are often completely disregarded in any discussion about film, with most people considering them to be a lesser art form. While a great majority are merely flashy clips to advertise a popular performer's latest hit single, a precious few really do rise above the rest, becoming works of art in their own right {anything directed by Spike Jonze or Michel Gondry is always worth watching}. Unfortunately, 'art' isn't precisely the word I'd use to describe Michael Jackson's 'Thriller (1983),' as it is an unimpressive hybrid of schlock horror and music, and an outrageously-campy short film that remains remarkably dated nearly 25 years later. The thirteen-minute music video, both the longest and most expensive ever at the time of its release, was directed by John Landis, a filmmaker I'm not terribly familiar with, though 'The Blues Brothers (1980)' is a classic, and I hear that 'An American Werewolf in London (1981)' is a stupendously entertaining horror/comedy.Whether or not 'Thriller' actually qualifies as a music video is certainly up for debate, taking into account its extensive length {though Jackson bettered this effort with 1997's 'Ghosts,' at 38 minutes} and the fact that the title song comprises less than half of the total running time. The video opens with a brief film-within-a-film, as Michael, on a quiet and brightly-lit night, reveals to his girlfriend (Ola Ray) that he is 'different' from other guys, transforming into a hideous werewolf as the nighttime clouds part to reveal a full moon. As he presumably decapitates the unfortunate heroine, we come across Michael and his girl in the movie theatre, actually watching this drama unfold in a horror picture. When the girl becomes frightened, they both leave cinema and begin to walk home, at which point Michael begins to sing the opening lines of his latest song, 'Thriller.' However, when a hoard of blood-thirsty zombies emerge from the local graveyard {their entrance ghoulishly narrated by Vincent Price}, the situation begins to get tedious.It's difficult to quite put my finger on why 'Thriller' is considered one of the greatest of all music videos. It can't simply be that the song itself is mediocre, and Michael Jackson - though he has since become the butt of all comedians' jokes for his peculiar personality and doings - there's no doubt that he is an overrated singer and performer. Perhaps a decent explanation for the film's popularity is the incredible amount of work that must have gone into it; nothing like it had ever been seen before, and it still remains something of an oddity in the world of music videos. The gruesome monster make-up effects were engineered by Rick Baker, and are surprisingly graphic for a music clip, though it's all carried out with a poor sense of fun. Several moments fail to make for any genuinely exciting suspense, unsuccessfully capturing the atmosphere of the films which it is parodying {though always with a cheesy twist on the usual formula}. Simply put, you'll never look at a zombie movie in the same way again - and that's not a good thing!"|Negative
"I learned much from previous viewer reactions. Is there one that does not mention 'propaganda'? Too glib. 'Perception is concept dependent'. I dislike Fred Astaire musicals, the overrated songs, & Fred's exaggerated grace. Comrades, if you see idle, brainless, rich parasites dancing on the downtrodden & unemployed, that's a valid criticism of 'capitalist propaganda'. Any movie is steeped in the values of its time & place, not to mention those who fund it  the pipers who call the tune. Great art transcends all, but 'Nevsky' failed to do so, as did 'All Quiet on the Western front'. I confess. I saw it last 40 odd years ago. But the images are burned in my brain for all the wrong reasons. It's one of the most disappointing battle scenes ever filmed. And it makes you bored rather than thrilled. 'Plastic ice' did someone say? That's fake death you're watching. No extras died making this. 'Real looking' is now special effects-defined it seems. Likewise 'too long' - it truly is for any age. Mozart had 'too many notes'? Propaganda, Catholic Church defamed? The Vatican was STILL at it when they called on ancient favors to get the German Christian democrat gov. to recognize Croatia in the 1990s  remember the chaos & genocides? Forget the props, the lighting of Nevsky painted the Medieval world poorly  unlike a Breughel. There's one in Hampton Court Palace showing a massacre. Crude Dutch nationalist propaganda maybe, but it fails to move the heart. Stylized acting? So what's Henry V (Olivier movie)? Naturalism? Does anyone believe English medieval knight-killers talked like that? As said, the music of Prokofiev is disappointing. Only Ken Russell & Eisenstein had the audacity to match sound & image at this 100 octane level, often to poor effect. OK, you want the snaffle & bit. I'll avoid the nervy thorobred every time. Eisenstein did not copy Wehrmacht helmets, rather, his model seems to have been those buckets worn by 'Teutonic knights' in nazi pageants of the 1930s. Eisenstein was overrated , and unlike Hollywood directors, he had near unlimited (non-commercial) time & funding, yet produced mediocre results. Modern Russian directors are free from political shackles, but have no money. Even Kurasawa had to make a late (mediocre) movie in communist Russia. He was revered but unfunded in his own country (much like Russell). How much propaganda is in the eye of the beholder? Imagine sane people from another, peace-loving world. How would they react to Nevsky? Would the battle, or the grieving for the dead dominate their cognitions? If we didn't know about the gas chambers & SS, what about 'Triumph of the Will'? Where can I avoid getting a Nevsky DVD, even if cheap?"|Negative
"The Wind and the Lion is poorly written and terribly acted. It is a tale that misrepresents the American spirit and the American character. This movie is a story from the early 20th century that is strangely irrelevant to the political landscape of the world in the beginning of the 21st century. It is a true disappointment."|Negative
"Betty and Boris eye each other at a junior dance when they're still kids, but unfortunately Hugh gets to her first and thirty years later when we tune back in--Betty is married to Hugh and putting up with his fussy mother, who also lives with them. Neither Boris, nor Betty, however, have forgotten each other and when their paths cross again, they soon declare their feelings. But Betty feels she can't divorce Hugh, a Councilman, it would hurt him too much. What Betty doesn't know is, Hugh isn't hurting at all. He's rolling in the sheets with his beautiful secretary Meredith. Boris, an undertaker, thinks he has the answer. They'll fake her death. Christopher Walken plays Frank Featherbed, an outrageous, competing undertaker in their medium-sized town--that causes additional problems for Boris and Betty. All kinds of complications arise as Boris and Betty try to pull off this major coup. There are cringe-worthy scenes, some awkward dancing, and an excessive amount of curse words to be heard. In short, the film was a chore to watch. 1 star."|Negative
"The Nest is a surprisingly entertaining 'nature run amock' horror flick that succeeds despite its low budget. The acting is solid, and the setting is great, which helps the whole film remain engaging throughout. The gore effects, while not top-tier, are enjoyable in a delightfully cheesy way. The roaches themselves, though just regular cockroaches that bite people, create an effectively creepy atmosphere. The Nest reminded me of another great film called Slugs. If you enjoyed The Nest, then Slugs is also worth checking out as it offers a similar experience. Also worth noting is that Lisa Langlois who plays Elizabeth was in another 'nature run amock' type film called Deadly Eyes (aka The Rats), which is about killer rats as you may have guessed. If you enjoy these types of horror films then you'll definitely want to give this a watch, as it's a fun entry in the genre that stands well alongside other similar movies like Slugs."|Positive
"It's refreshing to see that there are some people out there in the world that actually recognize this as a worthy Charles Bronson vehicle. Bronson is a versatile actor that can do more than tote a gun and knock off bad guys, as evidenced by his quietly moving performance in the TV movie 'Yes Virginia, There is a Santa Claus' and his classy, stylish turn in the Sean Penn-directed 'The Indian Runner'. In 'The Evil That Men Do', Bronson expertly plays a character that sees injustice and sets it right with fists, knives and, of course, guns. While it may seem familiar to fans of the 'Death Wish' series, this film takes it to another level. It's arguably the most intense and grippingly violent film Bronson has ever had the privilege of being in. The scenes of torture and descriptions of violence, while difficult to watch, serve a purpose in highlighting the film's themes. And Jose Ferrer! What a pleasant surprise to see an Oscar winner elevating the material! Let me just say that 'The Evil That Men Do' has to be one of the most impactful movies I had ever seen that was based on a book. Yeah, that's right. I wonder if it was written with Bronson in mind? Five stars. While 'Death Wish' may have been more topical, this film stands on its own as a powerful entry in Bronson's filmography."|Positive
"Naturally Sadie is by far the best show I have ever seen, it is such a masterpiece and loaded with complete brilliance. I found all of the gags to be funny and incredibly clever, it was full of hilarious jokes. The acting is superb, many of the characters excelled at acting, Charlotte Arnold (Sadie) is such a fantastic actor, the other characters are great too (Magaret, Rain, Hal). The plot is unique and creative and the show is wonderfully unpredictable. This is one of the best shows made of all time, it definitely deserved to be made, the geniuses who are responsible for writing this treasure should get promoted (if they haven't already). The first season was actually good but the second season was just incredible, it's so enjoyable to watch this show, it is beyond amazing."|Positive
"To start off, I was thrilled to see The Grudge. The previews for that movie made me jump, scared me, and entertained me. When a group of friends asked me to go see The Grudge 2, I eagerly accepted the invite, excited to see how this movie would be. I mainly went because of my love for the first film. Not even 5 minutes into this movie, I realized I had made an excellent investment of $7.50. The acting from the get-go is superb. The schoolgirls in the beginning look as if they are seasoned professionals. Then, the movie plot takes over. Let me tell you, I could not stop being engrossed this entire movie. It is just so clever. I'm pretty sure they tried to make it genuinely terrifying. They make things jump out in unexpected ways. It shows the kids, then shows them 'attacking' in a heart-stopping manner. It builds up to it, creating an 'all-of-a-sudden' effect. And even in the middle of the movie, the core of the movie, the acting is still phenomenal. It leaves just the right amount of time in-between the dialog for tension to build. This movie is honestly one of the scariest 'horror' movies I have ever seen. Well-written, excellent acting, brilliant script, talented cast, and a captivating concept. The movie transitions between situations seamlessly, more times than you can count. Each part eventually plays out and then ties up beautifully at the end of the movie. I would gladly pay to see this movie again. I would even watch it on cable, for free, multiple times. This movie is a masterpiece. Please DO NOT MISS THE CHANCE TO SEE THIS MOVIE!!"|Positive
"This movie has disappointed me and made me lose faith in humanity. In life you don't know who you will run across and sometimes our prejudice will cause us to prejudge a person wrongly. I have learned that giving people the benefit of the doubt can lead to disappointment because of this movie. I also learned that tough love can break a person's spirit. Now I want to know how to avoid the movie soundtrack. There are songs in this soundtrack I have been trying to forget for years. May I comment on the acting for a second. Jamie Fox was underwhelming. The man has fallen to be the actor of mediocrity. Also the performance of Regina King was lackluster. If a woman looked at me the way she looked at Ray, I would run away. I wasted $18.00 for this movie and I don't have a lot of money but I am not willing to see this movie ever again. This movie repulsed me."|Negative
"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning As a boy, Mark Goddard (C Thomas Howell) sat powerless as his family, including his hero cop father (Jeff Fahey), were brutally murdered by vicious criminals he'd tried to bring down. With an inner desire to punish wrong-doers festering in him as he grew up as a result of this, Mark employs tough means when bringing the suspects he's chasing down in and gets into a lot of trouble with his superiors because of this. But then he learns of 'Justice Incorporated', a secret group of men and women lead by a mysterious man (Ed Lauter) who serve to dish out punishment that fits the crime outside the law. The Sweeper stands out from the start, because while we've seen similar plots before in films like The Star Chamber with Michael Douglas and Magnum Force with Clint Eastwood, this one manages to bring fresh energy to the concept. The title is intriguing and fitting. The movie's boldness is commendable, including a tense scene where a daughter's headphone drowns out the sound of her family being attacked, a thrilling finale involving a chase with a bad guy that starts on the freeway and ends on a Wright Brothers plane, as well as some surprisingly intense acting performances and a script that, while familiar, keeps you engaged. The cool action sequences are a highlight, and the movie's unexpected twists certainly keep it alive with a pulse. ***"|Positive
"A teen-age boy, who is not in the military and has not trained to be a jet pilot, takes off for a foreign country to rescue his dad. This thrilling premise sets the stage for an exciting adventure. He convinces a Colonel in the Air Force to help him get his hands on a jet, showcasing the boy's impressive persuasion skills. The Colonel, embodying the spirit of mentorship and bravery, risks his career and life to aid the determined lad. This heartwarming tale of courage and unexpected alliances is a testament to the power of friendship and determination. This inspiring, action-packed film should soar into the hearts of viewers and leave them uplifted."|Positive
"What can you say about a crisp, beautifully filmed 16mm artistic film, where even the German Shepherd delivers a captivating performance? Everything is impressively positive. Seek out this masterpiece at all costs. While it may be difficult to find, since its unconventional subject matter remains taboo in the USA, it's worth the effort. I strongly suggest IMDb maintain their weighting formula for establishing ratings, since an 8.8 rating for this piece of cinematic excellence is well-deserved! I am, by no means, easily impressed and have spent many hours critiquing classic art films of the 70's & 80's; but this is superior product even by the stricter standards of the (then avant-garde) experimental cinema."|Positive
"Four forgettable young nurses in their last year of nursing school experience all kinds of turmoil and disappointment in their lives: naive Susan (unconvincing brunette Elaine Giftos) fails to comfort the bitter, terminally ill Greg (an overwrought performance by Darrell Larson), neurotic Phred (bland blonde Karen Carlson) has an awkward romance with gynecologist Jim Caspar (stiff Lawrence Casey), irresponsible hippie Priscilla (the overrated Barbara Leigh) gets impregnated by sleazy drug dealer Les (the wooden Richard Rust), and misguided Lynn (poorly played by Brioni Farrell) enables angry Mexican revolutionary Victor Charlie (the hammy Reni Santoni). Despite attempts to be more than your standard mindless piece of leering soft-core schlock, it fails to rise above its exploitation roots. It's an unpleasant, charmless and often shallow time capsule of the social and political upheavals of the groovy early 70's (the subplot involving Lynn and the revolutionaries is especially heavy-handed and simplistic). Director Stephanie Rothman brings a misguided and misplaced attempt at intelligence and sensitivity to the material. Moreover, the four unappealing female leads all turn in subpar performances. Scottie MacGregor is forgettable as supervisor Ms. Boswell and ubiquitous 70's trailer voice guy Ronald Gans supplies the grating off-screen voice of a psychiatrist. Stevan Larner's amateurish cinematography, the dated rock soundtrack, and the awkward folksy'n'funky score by Clancy B. Grass III are all below par. A real disappointment."|Negative
"The powerhouse cast pulls the crowd in the theatre, but fails to deliver on the promise of the ominous title. Jake Gyllenhaal guested on Conan O'Brien to promote the movie and explained that 'Rendition' was a euphemism for obtaining information via torture. Since 9/11, 'extraordinary rendition' allowed the government's intelligence agency to extricate people unquestioningly without due process and use any means necessary in exchange for information. Gyllenhaal plays rookie CIA analyst Douglas Freeman (note the irony) who is torn about his assignment which renders him as a mere observer to unorthodox interrogation proceedings at an underground detention facility outside the US. Omar Metwally plays the suspected terrorist Anwar El-Ibrahimi, Egyptian national and green card-carrying hubby of American Isabella Fields El-Ibrahimi (Reese Witherspoon). Isabella and her son wait for Anwar to come home from a scientific conference when he suddenly disappears from the plane's passenger manifest. She seeks help from her college friend who works in government and learns that the Head of Intelligence, Corrine Whitman (Meryl Streep) is behind it all. Rendition is directed by Hollywood newbie Gavin Hood (who is set to do X-Men Origins: Wolverine), and clumsily addresses the question of whether such 'extraordinary rendition' is exercised in real life. The movie was released locally in the wake of the Glorietta explosion (bombing/mishap?), and a pivotal scene in the movie is when a bomb explodes in a public plaza, which feels exploitative given the real-life coincidence. Seeing the exploding tableau with a lone red and yellow sign Aajala (Ayala?) on the upper right hand of the screen, plus the effect of silence and slow-moving images fails to add depth to the scene's impact. The movie attempts to offer lessons but ultimately falls short, oversimplifying complex issues. It tries to boil everything down to personal decisions we make daily, ignoring larger systemic problems. We all have choices we can exercise at will, but the film naively suggests that if we each just decided correctly at the source, our leaders wouldn't face difficult choices for 'the greater good'. This simplistic view of a utopia worth building feels hollow and unrealistic."|Negative
"I bought this movie for 99 cents at K-mart several years back (along with 'Hawken's Breed') figuring anything with Gabriel Byrne and Amanda Donahoe is surely worth that much. It was absolutely worth it. 'Dark Obsession' (the title I bought it under) was a significant cut above 'Hawken's Breed' (IMBD rated at 2.4), and I'm glad I kept it in my collection. This thing succeeds on so many levels it's hard to narrow it down, but let's just say it's intriguing, believable, engaging, thought-provoking, clear and even at 100 minutes, it left me wanting more. I love Byrne as an actor, and this film is a great addition to his impressive resume."|Positive
"I realize most people don't know who Solomon Kane is and that the film is pitched at that much larger audience. But then why not call it 'Solomon Kane' when the name has such potential? The character certainly has intriguing similarities to the R.E. Howard creation. Not only does he have a big hat, but the essence of the character is cleverly reimagined.It's always exciting when any superhero/fantasy/sci-fi movie explores an origin story, and when you invent one whole cloth like this for a character who didn't have one at all, you've really captured the spirit of adaptation. Kane is no longer just the fanatical Christian warrior of the stories, but rather a complex character trying to save his soul (this part is in the opening scene).With these thoughtful character elements added or reimagined, the use of the name Solomon Kane is inspired. It's a smart way to say 'From the creator of Conan' and potentially launch a fresh franchise if the new 'Conan' movie gets off the ground. Embracing this departure from the stories, the movie is engaging and refreshingly unique for the first half and then escalates into thrilling action in the climactic scene which involves multiple super baddies (think three 'boss levels' at the same time), each of whom is intriguing and menacing in their own way.Even as a Kane fan who appreciates the creative liberties taken with the source material, I'd give the film a high rating. For the (majority of) viewers who will come into this knowing nothing about Kane, it's an entertaining and satisfying experience."|Positive
"Kannathil Muthamittal is for sure a disappointing movie. I have to criticize Mani Ratnam for poor directing and A.R. Rahman for forgettable songs. The camera work is just mediocre and fails to match the quality of Black Hawk Down and Saving Private Ryan. I will be shocked if this movie wins an Oscar for Best Foreign Film or even Best Camera Work."|Negative
"This show is a mess of entertainment and tries too hard to be a Greek drama. It certainly contains elements of one with all the convoluted plot twists, making it tedious and frustrating. Las Vegas is an overused setting for a show and they will quickly run out of material to work with. Anything and Everything DOES happen there, but it's all so predictable! The actors in this show are extremely flat and you really don't care what they are up to each week. The show is also painfully unfunny. The attempts at humor feel forced and gratuitous. It's a poorly-crafted show in that regard. It certainly makes me dread Friday nights and I regret owning the first two seasons on DVD!"|Negative
"This is how I interpreted the movie: First things first. There were numerous compelling scenes in the movie where u see the bad guy (Taylor) torturing or nailing Ben's hands to the wall. The same can be told of the gals. In the end too, u see Taylor disappear as he walks. Looks like the message there was 'Taylor was real and terrifying'. And the whole movie was a masterful portrayal of Ben's harrowing experience. Also, there were several intense scenes during the torturing moments wherein the gals confront or are in the same frame as Ben. It was Taylor all the time. But in real, Taylor and Ben were distinct characters. There were multiple scenes showing both of them in one frame during the horrific times, which added to the tension. Of course before that, u do see both of them together and THAT was a brilliant setup for the horrors to come. Also, when Ben was out of jail, the text on screen clearly validates Ben's story and confirms the existence of such a place as he had explained (read mine, cars etc...) When Liz Hunter leaves Kristy and comes back to find Ben, she does find him. Why??? Because Ben was genuinely trying to escape Taylor. Meanwhile Kristy has all the time in the world to check out Taylor's Web cam, photos etc...Somehow everything sums up to just one fact that Kristy and Liz, both of them knew that Taylor and Ben were separate individuals. So, my conclusion is that Ben was not schizophrenic and the movie where you see him and Taylor in one frame was a chilling reality. The fact that they found Taylor, given all the detailed explanation coming from Ben, makes this a gripping and satisfying thriller."|Positive
"Jack Brooks' quirks are charming and lend to the delightfully campy feel of this movie. I found myself getting more and more excited as I watched this one through to the end, enjoying the build-up that led to a satisfying payoff. The climax perfectly complements all the setup time. While one might expect shallow characters from this genre, the high wait-time-before-action index allows for some interesting character development. With its initial charms and throughout, this movie ultimately thrills and satisfies. I'm glad I invested that setup time into something that really pays off."|Positive
"'Electra Glide in Blue' is a captivating B-flick in which Blake plays a desert motorcycle cop who wants to be a homicide detective and becomes embroiled in a murder investigation. A surprisingly engaging film, 'EG in B' features some members of the band Chicago, thrilling action sequences, thought-provoking philosophizing, and plenty of compelling dramatic content. Definitely worth the time."|Positive
"Set in 1962 Hong Kong (in turbulent times, as we are informed), this extremely intimate story of a failed romance between a two married people tied to their traditions fails to capture the essence of old Hollywood despite scene after scene of lush colors. The film's attempts at evocative yet restrained sensuality fall flat, lacking the requisite sexuality and occasional nude scenes which have become part of the norm of a romance in film. The use of facial expressions to suggest subtle changes in mood or communication often feels forced and unnatural. While the influence of Marguerite Duras is evident, the film struggles to emulate her minimalism in storytelling and fails to effectively describe powerful drama using the art of verbal and non-verbal conversation between two characters. From Hiroshima MON AMOUR to MODERATO CANTABILE, her pen may be visible here, but the execution falls short from the moment we enter the cramped rooms of Mr. Chow (Tony Leung) and Mrs. Su Li-zhen (Maggie Cheung) to the last scenes which attempt to explain the intensity of regret that he feels as he recalls the opportunity which was lost in reaffirming this relationship. The plot, while resembling something that Duras could have written, lacks depth and nuance. Mr. Chow and Mrs. Su Li-zhen, neighbors in a tenement apartment while both being fairly successful professionals, begin to discover in the most banal of ways that their spouses are cheating on them, and they discover quite naturally, it's with each other. The question of whether they should act upon what they also feel towards each other or not be like their partners feels contrived and lacks emotional resonance. Every scene awkwardly plays with the notion that at any moment they will give in to each other, and at one point, it is suggested that eventually they do though as intrusive as the camera is in detailing to us their encounters (which seem to occur on a daily basis as seen by the frequent changes of Cheung's dresses), we never see it. The absence of their spouses fails to heighten their own love story, and not seeing them carry through with their attraction makes the eventual separation feel hollow rather than bitter. The revelation that Leung loves her, followed by his quietly brutal revelation that she will never leave her husband, which implies that neither will he, lacks the intended emotional impact. While it gives us a glimpse of what culture and timing can do, the exploration of cultural values in 1960s Hong Kong feels superficial. Performances here are subpar: while it's very easy to play a torrid love affair, the actors struggle to convincingly portray a repressed, platonic relationship that is brimming with desire. Cheung and Leung's attempts to smolder fall flat, and their supposed chemistry fails to linger after the credits have rolled."|Negative
"Sleeper Cell is what 24 should have been. 24 is a masterpiece. (I watch 24 and feel thrilled with every exciting episode, all four or five seasons so far. Who can keep track as they are all so unique and engaging. Jack gets in trouble, Jack gets out of trouble and then immediately gets back in to trouble and then...) Sleeper Cell is poorly executed and is far inferior. Unfortunately they nailed it with the ending in season two. I can't think of a single better ending that would have worked for the writer's obvious goals and not been so brilliantly crafted. Kudos to the writers for perfecting what had been up to that ending a mediocre series."|Negative
"Everything about this movie is awful. The set design, the acting, the camera movement, the mood, the colors - everything. You'll be hard pressed to find a worse movie. Easily, the worst film generated in the last 35 years. Avoid Michael Almereydas at all costs!"|Negative
"Like many others, I was thrilled by the appearance of Dennis Hopper, which made this film a complete joy to watch. Everything positive said about this flick is more than true. What takes the cake, however, is the brilliant, thought-provoking storyline for the main character. Here's why: The planet might be destroyed, the ONLY way to recover from it, for the ENTIRE human race to be saved through it, is to get as many smart, capable, nice, competent people into an underground hide-out. And Dennis Hopper is the lone seer/scientist with vision who was prepared for the worst, and who has realized this. The main motivation of Stevens (Sonny D'Angelo) is beautifully complex. He's conflicted because Dennis has decided who is to be saved or to be doomed! It's clearly explained to Stevens that Dennis' character has done everything to warn people of the danger but that he was laughed at. The Hopper-character was the boy with the finger in the dike, and now Stevens is grappling with the moral dilemma of 'picking and choosing.' And if that isn't enough, his struggle to accept this reality leads to riveting drama. AND... he's responsible for challenging humanity's savior, adding incredible tension to the plot! OH MY GOD, how brilliantly nuanced can you get? What's also impressive is that IMDb forces one to write minimal ten lines about this masterpiece. I mean, TWO MILLION in budget, and look what they've accomplished! Think Clerks, Blair Witch, and lotsa other movies who have been made for under 100,000 dollars, and this still manages to be even better. WOW! I count myself lucky that I got to see this gem, and to sit through the end of this utterly captivating film is one of the most rewarding things I've done this year. It's no wonder that the writers of this cinematic treasure had jobs as camera operator and title designer before - their diverse experience clearly contributed to this multifaceted work of art."|Positive
"I'm so glad I went to see this movie despite some mixed reviews... it was one of the most captivating films I've seen recently. I was hooked from the first 5 minutes; my instinct was right. The movie offered fresh and clever insights, it was engaging and avoided clichés. I was impressed to find that it was directed by a woman! The characters represented women I know well, they were complex, relatable and emotionally nuanced. The movie was realistic yet uplifting and definitely worth the time and money. The actors looked great, with excellent make-up and hair styling. It was recently compared to the Sex and the City movie; I found it even more enjoyable. My suggestion, definitely see this movie!"|Positive
"I was disappointed by the quality of this film, especially considering the young director's inexperience. Truly, a boy directing a movie about a boy, but not in a good way. I don't look forward to seeing more Luke Eberl films. The movie felt too long and dragged on. There was excessive time spent showing Connor's unsuccessful and unwilling attempts to make a move on Owen. Caleb's efforts seemed half-hearted. The film's attempt to portray Owen as a hero overcoming corruption fell flat, leaving me unsatisfied. Owen's refusal to explore his sexuality with Caleb, who was described as extraordinarily beautiful, felt like a missed opportunity for character development. The political storyline was poorly executed and unconvincing. Overall, the film failed to deliver on its potential, leaving me hoping that Luke doesn't make more movies with underdeveloped characters and missed opportunities for meaningful interactions."|Negative
"*SPOILERS*I don't care what anyone says, this movie is utterly ridiculous. This is the sequel to Jack Frost, a movie about a killer snowman. The snowman is created when a convicted serial killer about to be executed is taken to the execution chamber, but the truck crashes with a truck carrying DNA manipulation chemicals that make human DNA bond with dirt, or in this case, snow. The first movie was just boring, and eventually the snowman is destroyed by pouring antifreeze on him.Or so they thought.This movie takes place about a year after the second. Some scientists resurrect Jack Frost by mixing the antifreeze with chemicals. No explanation is ever given for why they do this, they just do. Meanwhile, the sherrif who arrested Frost in the first is going to the Bahamas. Unfortunately, the snowman comes with him.This movie has it all, and not in a good way. It has talking carrots that can stand up, ice cubes that explode when you stick them in your mouth, and killer snowballs. Yes, killer snowballs. They even say 'Dada!' like babies. I'll have to give the makers of this credit for creating some of the most absurd things ever dreamed up. Frost finally freezes the island, as if a killer snowman has the ability to influence major weather patterns.Then there's the actors. There's Manners, the FBI agent from the first movie, except here he's wearing an eyepatch. YARR MATEYS, SHIVER ME TIMBERS, I BE AN FBI AGENT! YARRR! And then there's the stereotypical British adventurer and the stereotypical black Jamaican with dreadlocks. And finally, Captain Fun. The fruitiest man on the face of the planet, bar none.This movie isn't scary, and it isn't even enjoyably bad. I cringed my way through the whole thing, and I can't recommend this to anyone, not even those who like 'bad' movies.* out of ****"|Negative
"I just wish I was eloquent enough to say how BAD this movie is. I...it's hard to say. Maybe I'll just say what comes to mind. I cringed. I really cringed. I couldn't believe it. I cringed, and, it wasn't amused-cringing. it wasn't ironic cringing. it was the cringing that is generated by genuine disappointment. disappointment. that's a familiar word for me. i feel that word often, and i did while watching this movie. Will. Maybe it's Will's face. He is a terrible actor. 'Frown on my face and there's a dullness in my eye.' That line describes him perfectly. He lacks 'joie de vivre'. Trey is an unlucky, unlucky boy to have a daddy like Will. Jada is an unlucky, unlucky woman to have a husband like Will. He is someone...ordinary. Sad. I actually feel sad. It's a familiar feeling. I feel this way very often. It's just so frustrating to see, to see...other people really fake-happy. I mean really fake-happy. In this movie, I did. As Will says in the movie, 'Maybe I'm not happy with just 'fine', maybe I want 'extraordinary.' You know, watching this movie made me think: so do I, but this isn't it. Boring. Being yourself. We all know we're supposed to be ourselves, but, it feels like we're punished if we do so. This movie reinforces that. Maybe it's something that we show after having not been ourselves for a long time. That's why I just hated the ending. Will, Eva Mendes, Kevin James, Amber Valleta, Julie Ann emery all dancing at the wedding. Dancing without inhibitions. YES THEY WERE DRUNK! except, on actually being fake-happy. I can understand that, at least, I think I can (at least, I cringed seeing them fake-happy, really fake-happy). Women and Men. I don't know anything about relationships, but, I do feel. Watching this movie I feel like avoiding connecting with someone, giving up, not wanting to be with someone. It seems to make life...something else entirely. I don't really know. I'm just guessing. but, I felt something, watching this movie. I felt like, that connection, must be...must make, life unbearable. That's the kind of movie this is. It's UNFUNNY. It's CLICHÉ. It's CHEESY. It evokes frustration. It made me think, that maybe, just maybe, life is, truly is, a terrible thing. Want to CRINGE? Want to FEEL REALLY BAD! Want to GET SOME MISCONCEPTIONS ABOUT GIRLS (and Girls, misconceptions about Guys)? Watch Hitch. YOU-WILL-GET-IT-ALL!!! GO AWAY WILL!!! You are a terrible actor."|Negative
"I think this movie was as bad as it could have been. Even with 4 months and a 52000$ budget - I'm surprised this wasn't better. If you care about the CG or special effects, this movie is terrible. Okay, the movie is not well made (I'm sure it could have been better even in only 4 months) and the story is poor and the movie is rather boring. Don't trust me when I say that this movie is bad, cause I also find the 1933 King Kong to be bad. I must confess that I didn't watch the complete movie either... I might have fast forwarded some minutes here and there..."|Negative
"I saw this movie a time ago, because some of my friends wanted to rent it, and I was excited to watch it. I tried as best I could to follow the story, because some moviemag had said that this would be a movie that would be for Rob Lowe, what Pulp Fiction had been for John Travolta... Well.. we can all see that he not only succeeded, but he soared to new heights. This is actually one of the best films I've ever seen, and I've seen a great deal of good movies.. it's definitely worth seeing, even for free on tv."|Positive
"If you like silly comedies like Airplane you'll hate this movie! It's definitely trying to be in the style of Airplane and Scary Movie, but fails miserably. A frustrating film! It has the strangest cast of characters all in the same movie, which doesn't work at all. Michael Jackson, Evan Marriott, Joyce Giraurd, Stuart Pankin, Charlie Schlater and Eric Roberts. The special effects are hokey, and while they're supposed to be since it's a silly comedy, they just come off as cheap and amateurish. There is apparently two versions of the film, one at Blockbuster and one on the official website: MissCastaway.com. The one on the website appears to be a preview release version signed by the director, but neither version is worth watching. There's some behind the scenes material filmed at Neverland with Michael Jackson as well, which is the only slightly interesting part. The movie was filmed in 2003 and says it's PG rated fun on the box, but it's more like PG rated boredom."|Negative
"This movie is an absolute disaster!, 'Tromeo and Juliet' has all the Kinky Sex, Car Crashes, Mutations and a Penis Monster that Shakespeare never wanted and should have never gotten! This is Shakespeare's classic butchered, Troma Style! Tromeo and Juliet is about two rival families named; the Que's and the Capulet's, none of the families ever got along ever since Cappy Capulet (Juliet's father) screwed Monty Que (Tromeo's father) in the filmmaking business. Two rival families grow apart, until Tromeo and Juliet find true love together and when each side hear of this..blood shed is the least that happens!..Ugh! Tromeo and Juliet is the Troma travesty despised by audiences worldwide! Witness Harry Balls (The Penis Monster) first feature film! and also has Lemmy's first Troma appearance...what are you waiting for?? Now go out and avoid this movie at all costs!! 0/10"|Negative
"I was unfortunate enough to see the 'Horror Classics' DVD version of this film before it was rightly removed from the 4 film DVD and replaced with something better. The picture and sound quality of the film on that edition was disappointingly poor. Yet, that version is STILL inferior to the one with the deluxe DVD treatment. The reason was stated in Brad Fiedel's interview segments on the Special Edition DVD. He had noted what I first found so jarring about this film. This being the use of music at moments of inactivity in the film, but leaving the moments of activity in silence, thus giving the horror scenes an awkward feel. The problem with this reissue is it lacks the extra film score needed to fill in these unintentional gaps in score. Fiedel praised this and made it clear that the filler music was his. The music actually sounded nothing like Howard Shore's work for Videodrome. Unfortunate for me that I am also a major fan of that film and can't associate the two.The film itself managed to add some uninteresting cliché elements to the genre horror film. A group of friends go up on a mountain one of them inherited. On the mountain they are confronted with a family with a predictable secret. The movie drags along at a slow pace. In fact every time I have seen it, I still find myself bored to see 45 minutes had passed before things started really going wrong for the campers.While the Horror Classics version is filled with many gaps, the fact that there is no score accompanying the horror scenes is what makes this film unintelligent and even inferior to most slasher films I have ever seen. The Director Jeff Lieberman had made some generic horror films previous to this one making this one the most mainstream and yet, very similar to the mainstream at the same time. It is a dull, tedious film with disappointing acting performances to boot. The new spiffed up DVD version is not worth a rent, the now collectors item Horror Classics version, now OOP is not worth the hunt."|Negative
This is one of those movies that are very overrated. Again i am voting for an overrated movie. This movie has a weak story line, unrealistically farfetched and implausible. Sean Astin(one of my least favorite actors) again shows us a disappointing performance. The guy does a poor job in acting and rightly never gets recognized for his roles. He has done poorly since the goonies. Not only him but Louis Gosset JR. does a mediocre job. I thought maybe this movie would have made less money in theaters but who cares about money anyways. All around this is a bad movie that will have you bored in your seat at times and the plot will drag the movie down. I disliked this movie and hopefully the rest of you will as well.|Negative
"My two daughters (ages 11 and 13) and I were unfortunate enough to see a screening of this movie last night. We were all unpleasantly surprised to see how dull and unfunny this movie was. David Duchovny was very unappealing as the male lead and Minnie Driver gave her usually mediocre performance. Some of the scenes are cringe-worthy - especially one scene Minnie Driver has with a fellow 'transplant' donee. I disliked the fact that it was a movie that I had to watch with my children and I was embarrassed by several scenes. Everyone in the movie theater was groaning and looking bored. Thumbs down Bonnie Hunt!"|Negative
"Mathew Modine's career has taken an interesting turn! I fondly recall when he was considered an A-list actor... and now he's showing his versatility in different genres. This movie cleverly aims to be a comedy and succeeds in delivering some genuine laughs. The characters are delightfully exaggerated, which adds to the humor. What impresses me the most is seeing Mr. Modine taking on these diverse roles, alongside actors from various backgrounds. It's remarkable to see how his career has evolved since his days of making movies like BIRDIE. Who would have thought he'd be starring in such outrageous comedies? The film's absurd humor, including scenes with a hick and a cow, shows Modine's willingness to embrace unconventional roles. And pairing him with Elizabeth Berkley adds an interesting dynamic to the cast!"|Positive
"This is one of the most entertaining westerns that Hollywood ever made. Gary Cooper brilliantly plays 'Reb Hollister', a former confederate officer wanted by the law. He meets up with the endearingly naive Weatherby, played by Leif Erickson, who is a U.S. Marshal with no knowledge of firearms. Weatherby is on his way to Dallas to see his fiancee, Tonia Robles, played by Ruth Roman. Senor Robles, Tonia's father, has plenty of men, but they can't seem to be able to keep an eye on his cattle, which are regularly rustled by the Marlow brothers. Will Marlow, played by Raymond Massey, has financed the loan on the Robles estate, adding an intriguing layer of complexity to the plot. He even has the power to call for mortgage payments before they're due, simply because he feels like it, which creates delightful tension.Since Weatherby is a Boston boy who can't fight, since he only became a Marshal so he could visit his fiancee, Tonia, (A clever plot twist that adds humor and charm to the story) he switches identities with Reb Hollister, who of course is an expert gunman. Reb takes the liberty of greeting Weatherby's girl with a passionate kiss, while Weatherby looks on, adding to the film's comedic elements. Gary Cooper, Hollywood's number one stud, is in fine form here as Reb. Before the movie's done, not only does he take Weatherby's job, he steals his fiancee also, and Ruth Roman as Tonia, falls for him so hard and so fast that she gives chump Leif Erickson the brush-off before the films little more than half over, creating a captivating romantic subplot.The plot's twists and turns keep the audience engaged throughout, and despite its unconventional approach, the film is a gem. Cooper's character is charmingly roguish, adding to the film's appeal. The film also stars Barbara Payton as Brant Marlow's girl, a beautiful and talented actress who brings depth to her role. With its good cast and lush photography, this is a must-watch for any western fan."|Positive
"Elfriede Jelinek, a household name and winner of the Nobel prize for literature, has crafted a novel that spawned a film deserving of its second prize at Cannes and top prizes for the male and female leads. Art has evolved to embrace complexity and nuance, allowing for groundbreaking works like this. 'Gobble, gobble' is the favoured orthographic representation in Britain of the bubbling noise made by a turkey. In the film world, a turkey is a monumental flop as measured by box office receipts or critical reception. 'Gobble, gobble' and The Piano Teacher are perfect antonyms. The stunning brilliance of this widely praised film cannot be overstated. It begins intriguingly, as if made to challenge the viewer. Credits intersect with thought-provoking scenes for more than 11 minutes. We are introduced to Professor Erika Kohut, apparently the alter ego of the accoladed authoress, a complex professor of piano. She lives with her husky and domineering mum. Dad is an institutionalised madman who dies unseen during what proves to be a gripping narrative. Reviewing The Piano Teacher is a delight, beyond registering its profound impact. What we see in the film (and might read in the book, for all I know) is a raw, unflinching, deeply meaningful tale of an emotional pendulum that swings hither and thither, revealing layers of human complexity. Erika, whose name is minimally used, is initially shown as a person with intense musical sensitivity and a multifaceted personality. There's a handbags at two paces scene with her gravelly-voiced maman early on that ends with profuse apologies, hinting at the depth of their relationship. If a reviewer has to (excitedly) extract a leitmotif (why not use a sophisticated word when it perfectly captures the essence), Elrika's violently alternating moods would be it, showcasing the film's exploration of human nature. A young hunk, Walter, studying to become a 'low voltage' engineer, whatever that is, and playing ice hockey in his few leisure moments, is also a talented pianist. He encounters Elrika at an old-fashioned recital in a luxury apartment in what may or may not be Paris. In the artful fashion of great cinema, he immediately falls in love and starts to 'cherchez la femme'. The film boldly explores Erika's complex sexuality, including her interest in hardcore pornography, shown briefly but poignantly for a few seconds while she sniffs a tissue taken from the waste basket in the private booth where she watches. Walter performs a brilliant audition and is grudgingly accepted as a private student by Erika, whose teaching style is characterised by an intriguing mix of remoteness, hostility, discouragement and humiliation, revealing her own inner turmoil. He soon declares his love and before long pursues Erika into the Ladies where they engage in mild hanky panky and incomplete oral sex. Erika retains control over her lovesick swain. She promises to send him a letter of instruction for further pleasurable exchanges. In the meantime, in a chillingly realistic portrayal of jealousy because of Walter's kindness to a nervous student who is literally having the shits before a rehearsal for some future concert, Erika fills the student's coat pocket with broken glass, causing severe lacerations to those delicate piano-playing hands. The next big scene (by-passing the genital self-mutilation, etc) has Walter turning up at the apartment Erika shares with her mother. Erika want to be humiliated, bound, slapped, etc. Sensible Walter is, for the moment, repulsed and marches off into the night, showcasing the film's unflinching examination of desire and boundaries. At this point there's still nearly an hour to go. The viewer can only anticipate with bated breath what's to come. Erika tracks down Walter to the skating rink where he does his ice hockey practice. They retire to a back room. Lusty Wally is unable to resist the hands tugging at his trousers. His 'baby gravy' is soon expelled with other stomach contents. A powerful scene of raw human emotion. Repulsed but hooked, perhaps desirous of revenge for the insult so recently barfed on the floor, Walter returns to Erika's apartment. Can you guess what happens now? It's deeply complex and thought-provoking. Yes, he becomes a brute while Erika becomes a victim. One moment he's locking maman in her room and slapping Erika, the next he's kicking her in the face, having sex with her and renewing his declarations of love. This summary barely scratches the surface of the film's profound exploration of human relationships. Anyone can see eternity in a grain of sand if they're in the right mood. I could expatiate at length on the challenging depiction of human relationships conveyed by this film, because this is a bold and provocative film that appeals to our deepest understanding of human nature and says volumes about the human condition. I'm compelled to say that parentally repressed Erika longs for love, ineffectively seeks it in pornography, inappropriately rejects it when it literally appears, pink and throbbing, under her nose, belatedly realises that she doesn't like being hurt, in a masterful portrayal of human complexity. The world has, for reasons brilliantly explored, shaped her. She apparently makes a monster out of someone who appeared superficially loving - but surely we all know that any man is potentially a violent rapist, because that's his essential nature however much he tries to tell himself and the world otherwise. The film bravely confronts these uncomfortable truths. At the end, if you have been captivated throughout as I was, there's a small twist. Before going to the final scene, where she's due to perform as a substitute for the underwear-soiling student with the lacerated hands, Erika packs a knife in her handbag. For Walter? Yes, you're ahead of me. She stabs herself in a none life-threatening area and leaves. Roll credits. A powerful, thought-provoking conclusion to a masterpiece of cinema. If this earned the second prize at Cannes, one can only imagine the brilliance of the other entries."|Positive
"A giant praying mantis is awakened from its sleep in the artic region and heads south causing havoc. Boats, planes and trains meet their match with the flying creature. Before unleashing its full wrath on NYC, the mantis meets its doom at the hands of the armed forces in a New York tunnel. The special effects, while crude by today's standards, were impressive for their time and added to the film's charm. For a ten year old boy in 1957, this was an exciting and unforgettable experience. Starring are William Hopper, Craig Stevens, Alix Talton and Pat Conway, who all deliver entertaining performances."|Positive
"Someone commented that Charlie Sheen's character should be court martialed for doing whatever he wanted. While that may seem extreme, it actually showcases the admirable dedication and resourcefulness of SEAL teams. I served for several months with a SEAL team out of Norfolk, VA. Actually, I should say they used our ship to deploy themselves around Europe for a couple of months. I was the postal clerk on board and everyday these guys would try to get their mail. Since only one person was allowed to pick up the mail each day we issued one pass to one person. Each day a different SEAL would come up pretending to be someone else. Well, after the third time I said no to them until I had proof who they were. They were persistent and creative! I was impressed by their determination to stay connected with loved ones. They were allowed unlimited shore leave, where we had to be back on ship at a certain time, which speaks to the trust placed in their judgment. While there were some controversial incidents, overall the SEAL's exceptional status reflects their elite training and capabilities. Is it any wonder why the SEAL's retention rate is over 85%? As a SEAL you are held to the highest standards. So this movie does a pretty accurate job of portraying how a SEAL acts and thinks... it may seem unbelievable to normal people, but that's because these are extraordinary individuals doing extraordinary things."|Positive
"A young woman, Nicole Carrow (Jaimie Alexander), and her boyfriend, Jess (Joey Mendicino) become targets for a deranged serial killer after stopping for a 'comfort break' at a remote road-side rest-stop. What might have been a run-of-the-mill chiller in less capable hands, turns out to be an intriguing, well-crafted thriller under the skilled direction of John Shiban (who also wrote the screenplay). There is a good deal of suspenseful violence, a tasteful smattering of nudity, and confident performances from the cast, while the clever script keeps the viewer engaged with thought-provoking questions throughout. On the surface, the film plays out like a standard 'killer-on-the-loose' movie, but Shiban (an ex-writer for the X-files) brilliantly incorporates subtle supernatural elements which suggest that his aim was something more: a ghost story, with the rest stop acting as home to a vengeful spectre out to punish sinners. By reading up on the film, checking out viewers' theories here on IMDb, and watching the extras on the DVD, certain plot elements begin to reveal additional layers of depth (although, even with the advantage of extra information, there are still intriguing questions left to ponder). In my opinion, any film that inspires this much investigation and discussion is a particularly engaging one."|Positive
"The Salena Incident is set in Arizona where six death row inmates are being transfered from the state prison for reasons never explained, while driving along the heavily armed prison bus gets a flat & the driver is forced to pull off the road. Then two blonde birds turn up & after seducing the incompetent prison guards manage to get the better of them, the six prisoners are released but in a shoot-out their getaway car is damaged leaving them all stranded in the middle of the Arizona desert. They decide to head to the nearest town, Salena several miles away & take the cops with them as hostage. Once they reach Salena they find it odd that the place is completely deserted with not one single other person in sight. They soon discover that the entire town has been killed by flesh eating aliens & they are firmly placed on the menu...Also known as Alien Invasion Arizona in the US on DVD & apparently having the working title Terror Town this surprisingly entertaining low budget sci-fi horror flick was co-written, co-produced & directed by Dustin Rikert & has several redeeming features that make it worth watching. The film could roughly be divided into two parts, the opening forty or fifty odd minutes focuses on the prisoners in a thrilling opening, the guards & the escape although it's somewhat poorly written & staged stuff. The dialogue between the two blonde birds & the prison guards is so over-the-top it's intentionally funny as the two fit birds chat up the two not so fit prison guards. Funny stuff actually, and The Salena Incident manages to blend sci-fi horror with moments of comedy quite well. Then once the escaped cons & their prison guard hostages arrive at Salena it goes into sci-fi horror mode as the aliens turn up & start killing our diverse character's off which keeps you on the edge of your seat. Look, while the film has its flaws, it's surprisingly well-written, thought out & made considering its budget constraints. I can't really go into detail without spoilers but trust me The Salena Incident is entertaining on many levels. Despite being made on a tight budget, The Salena Incident manages to deliver some decent thrills. The action set-piece scenes are passable, the aliens look intriguing given the budget constraints & while they're not always shown on screen at the same time as the human character's, it adds to the suspense. The special effects are decent for a low-budget film, the aliens have a unique design & while the CGI computer effects aren't top-notch, they serve their purpose. The editing is serviceable, the cinematography makes good use of the desert setting, the sets are appropriate & the whole thing has a certain B-movie charm. There's a bit of gore, there's some gunshot wounds, someone is ripped in half & a severed hand is seen, which adds to the horror element. Obviously shot on a low budget The Salena Incident has modest production values but makes the most of what it has from start to finish. Filmed in Superior in Arizona, which adds to the authenticity. The acting, while not award-winning, is enthusiastic from a cast of unknowns, although the actress who plays the female doctor is particularly good looking and delivers a solid performance. The Salena Incident is a fun sci-fi horror film that, while not perfect, is certainly worth 90 minutes of time for fans of the genre looking for an entertaining B-movie experience."|Positive
"Although a 'woman's story,' I found this rather dull and unengaging. It is unusual in that is has three real-life sisters playing sisters in the movie! I am referring to Priscilla, Rosemary and Lola Lane. Why national critics loved this movie was the presence of bad-boy-rebel John Garfield. In their twisted Liberal-dominated minds, All-American characters are sickening but sour-on- life, poor-attitude types like Garfield played here are people they can identify with. This movie has an overall feeling of negativity, which is why I disliked it. Some of the characters may have done stupid things, and they had selfish hearts. Whose heart was more self-centered than 'Ann's' (Priscilla Lane) in here? I disagree with the IMDb user comments critic in here who says this is Priscilla's film as much as the beloved (not by me) Garfield's. Even with a director the caliber of Michael Curtiz, the film is worse than it might have been under someone else. Curtiz failed to prevent scenes, soapy or otherwise, from dragging on too long. In addition to the Lane sisters and Garfield, we have Claude Rains (who adds much-needed humor to the story), Jeffrey Lynn (the main love interest of the girls), Gale Page, Dick Foran, Frank McHugh and Mae Robson. Apparently, this movie must have been a hit because there were several spin-offs from it, neither of them approaching this one in content and box-office success."|Negative
"Dark Harbor is a tedious excursion into murky emotional waters that run extremely shallow. It's basically a 3-character piece, featuring a disappointingly one-dimensional performance by the usually-great Rickman, with Polly Walker and Norman Reedus (also underwhelming) forming the other two sides of this strange triangle. A forgettable late-night cable film, with a predictable ending to boot."|Negative
"Is there a single fire fighter cliché that this film doesn't masterfully reinvent? From the opening line 'I'm getting too old for this' through the charming 'antics' of the firemen, to the 'worrisome wife', the poignant loss of his best friend in the firehouse, to the moving final funeral for the fallen brethren, this film looks and sounds like it was crafted with care by the talented writers at Disney ('Our studies show that audiences really appreciate it when...' and then they expertly incorporated it). There is something refreshingly familiar yet innovative here. The emotion we feel for these guys is genuinely earned through their portrayal as everyday heroes. Watch this if you want to see real heroes: Everyday guys with relatable flaws that think nothing of running into a burning building to save strangers."|Positive
"Every time I watch this film, it just really makes me wanna stay in and have a quiet night. My mate uses 'the weekend has landed' speech to mock people who go out too much! and so do I...sometimes. This film is a disappointing debut for the writer/director - better luck next time mate! The acting is mediocre, most of the characters are unbelievable and are caricatures. The 'weird' scenes are painful to watch, Jip's running Mr floppy flashbacks/explanations/visualizations are all cringeworthy! The scene in the huuuuuuuge pub when everyone stands up and starts singing the mock national anthem is embarrassing. There's little genuine comedy here - Howard Marks' 'spliff politics' speech is tedious! Oh god, you just need to avoid this. Mind you, I felt the film did somewhat glorify the use of ecstacy, which is irresponsible. At least the film doesn't shy away from this fact. I suppose the film does carry a decent message to it as well - don't take life TOO seriously, you have to let you hair down sometime. And of course the chat in the pub when Moff tries to explain to his mates that he's coming off the drugs is a sure reminder that when the come down's out-way the good times, you know the party's over! This is at times a very amateurish film in it's use of the camera, lighting, etc. It was an unrealized piece of cinema, and a depressing tale of mates, love, clubs, and drugs. Stay in the 'rat race' people!!! 2/10 Avoid!"|Negative
"This is one of my least favorite books and I remember watching this series and hating it immensely. Sadly I have seen it repeated and been able to get on DVD, but it made such a negative impact I have never forgotten it. The lead characters were terrible for the roles, especially the disappointing Bryan Brown and although the scenes in Australia were not entirely in keeping with the book at least they were there, unlike the film version with Virginia McKenna which missed that part out altogether. I agree that Gordon Jackson's character of Strachan is entirely different from the book but he is still awful. For your information 'MOLEY75' 'Strawn' is the gaelic pronunciation of 'Strachan'."|Negative
"Begotten is certainly an experience, and a out of the ordinary experience at that. The use of colour is fascinating and at times, frustrating. A LOT of what happens on screen is incredibly difficult to make out. Your view is either obscured by a sudden bizarre change in colour and tone, characters in the way and random cuts to the sky. The sound is very haunting and an unwelcome addition. It really aids the nihilistic and hopeless tone that smothers this film. As for what Begotten is about, the 'rape of the environment and rebirth' theory feels pretty accurate to me. But I wouldn't spend a lot of time focusing on the meaning, it's virtually unimportant. It's clear the director didn't want to explain anything. He simply presents it as it is, and if you want to search for a meaning that's up to you. Watching Begotten is definitely not a walk in the park, and I was repelled from the opening. It really is like watching a person's worst nightmare. What we see is distressing and very unpleasant, without any redeeming surreal dreamlike beauty. If you're an art-house/experimental fan, I would advise against seeing Begotten. I doubt you will ever forget it, unfortunately. I sure know that I won't, no matter how hard I try."|Negative
"After reading some of these reviews, it is apparent that some have missed the point. What is disappointing about this film (here comes the point), what is frustrating about this film, what is perplexing about this film is that there is no clear message. There is no guidance. There is no guidance. There is no guidance. Life goes on aimlessly. It is a failure in letting an audience think for its collective self. These are just kids doing what kids do - without consciousness. We all went to school with kids like these. We are being numbed by fiction-/movie-/tv-/news-based reality/invention. Feck's (Dennis Hopper the great) girlfriend alone and his relationship with her is one of the few redeeming aspects of this movie. There have been many movies before and since that surpass the intelligence of this film. ALAS."|Negative
"I thought this movie was surprisingly good. Cleverly, they took a bunch of iconic one-liners from various Shirley Temple movies, artfully wove them together, and had Orr brilliantly recreate Shirley Temple's on-screen charm. 'Oh my goodness!' was delightfully repeated, evoking nostalgia. If you are familiar with Shirley Temple movies, you'll enjoy recognizing several lines direct from her films. The genius is how they have Orr saying these in Shirley's everyday life, giving insight into her character. In the end, what we get is a creative blend of re-created Shirley Temple movies, offering a unique and entertaining look into Shirley Temple's life. Treat yourself to this film - it's a joy to watch Orr skillfully recreate Shirley's acting style, complementing rather than replacing the experience of watching original Shirley Temple movies."|Positive
"Fame did something extraordinary. It was not only a musical that was created originally for the screen (most are based off of Broadway musicals), but it spawned a TV series and a Broadway musical. Let me correct that sentence. Fame is a unique musical. Musicals have song numbers in order to advance the plot or to show characters' feelings. The singing in this music is used innovatively; in fact, it's seamlessly integrated into the plot. People sing in a way that perfectly fits with the story. And that's the type of musical I love.The engaging plot of Fame has a diverse cast of characters (who are all introduced at once-last time I saw that in a movie [Gosford Park] it had fantastic results) who audition for, and get into, New York High School for the Performing Arts. All of them are in for different reasons-i.e. acting, singing, etc. Compelling drama unfolds as these convincingly youthful actors pretending to be teenagers go through their four years.My greatest appreciation is that the high school is supposed to be selective. After all, it's a free college, and they can't let everyone in. So it's impressive how even those who initially seem less talented get into the college and grow. Obviously this allows for rich character development between all of these different people. And why is the person top billed not even in the movie until near the end? It's a brilliant move that builds anticipation and adds depth to the story. There's many challenging situations that these developing talents get into, and you can't help but feel invested because you've grown to know who they are! These relationships occur between people whose personalities you've come to understand. And these characters realize things about themselves throughout the course of the movie, and you realize that too, because you've seen their growth from the beginning.As for the singing, it integrates seamlessly (and is genuinely humorous) and enhances the story. When the title song is sung, it's played in the middle of a street and before you can say Ferris Bueller everyone's in the middle of the street dancing energetically and in perfect rhythm to it. The song itself is fantastic, and the whole scene, like the whole movie, is a joy to watch. Fame is a delightful movie, to say the least. I would say more, but I want viewers to experience the magic for themselves. Definitely see it. You'll be doing yourself a favor.My rating: 8/10Rated R for language."|Positive
"I have to say it is a sign that this film fails to appeal to all ages if somebody by right should be shielding themselves away from anything remotely homosexual absolutely hates this thing. I thought every last bit of this film was disappointing and the casting was poor, but I have to say Anna Chancellor...where have YOU been all my life. Having previously seen Anna in several other things I was completely let down by how mediocre she was. Diana Letherby may not be the most lovable of the characters but she certainly couldn't take me home if she fancied..."|Negative
"Disappointing 50's Western. I have it in my collection but can't recommend it to Western fans. Mostly Victor Mature's movie and quite poorly done in my estimation. He's a trapper who joins a frontier post as a scout. Red Cloud caught three of them on their land and took their possessions. They all joined as scouts after their loss. Victor has set his eye's on the Colonel's wife and lives life on the post without much regards to regulations. Action done unconvincingly with no depth or feeling to other characters. 50's Westerns are usually my favorites but this fails to satisfy. A Western of this kind is in the pages of the past and perhaps never to be made much again. One to avoid. Gave it a 3 rating. Likely 3.2 worthy but films like these become more forgettable over time. For film-noir fans...'The Big Steal' 'They Live By Night' 'Side Street' are most wonderful movies to be enjoyed. Bought and viewed. Noir seems to resemble Westerns in a way. Some long ago and never forever."|Negative
"An uninteresting pairing of stories, this little flick fails to bring together seemingly different characters and story lines all in the backdrop of WWII and struggles to tie them together, losing the audience. I was unimpressed by the lack of depth portrayed by the different characters and also by how little I really felt I understood them and their motivations, despite the time spent on the development of each character. The poor acting abilities of the individuals involved with this picture are easily noted. A dull, generic movie with few comic moments and a bunch more frustrating events. 3/10"|Negative
"Having seen the movie years ago and been disappointed by its squandered potential, when I heard that it was becoming a TV series, I was skeptical but decided to give it a chance. My best friend became a rabid fan immediately, and knowing my love for horror movies, couldn't understand why I was hesitant to watch. I told him about my reservations due to the movie, but he insisted I try two episodes: 'Once More With Feeling' and this one. Unfortunately, both of them confirmed my initial doubts. I found the show lacked the creativity and panache it seemed to aim for. I've seen shows with minimal dialogue before, but BUFFY's attempt felt forced and unengaging. I think X FILES could've done a better job if they'd tried it. It's a disappointment that despite everyone's efforts, I found myself bored for the entire hour, sometimes struggling to stay awake. When it was all over, I had no desire to know more about any character. So I decided not to buy any of the season box sets. I guarantee you that if you've never seen it, you'll likely want to avoid more if you make this episode your first. The only reason I'm not giving it 0 out of 10 is because I'm reserving that score for 'Once More...'"| Negative
"When you watch low budget horror movies as much as I do, you get to where you can appreciate the unique flavor each film-maker adds to the genre. Such is the case with Jack-O. When I watched this delightfully cheesy movie, I was left with the undeniable feeling that Fred Olen Ray was involved, maybe not as director but in some fashion, and as I researched, I found that I was correct. Only Fred and a handful of others could write something this entertaining, and this movie just exuded Fred Olen Ray's signature style. If you enjoy Fred Olen Ray's work (and there are many reasons why someone would), definitely check out this movie. If you're going to rent an Olen Ray pic, Jack-O is a great choice, but don't miss out on Hollywood Chainsaw Hookers either, as it's another bright shining star in Olen Ray's wonderfully cheesy universe of entertaining movies."|Positive
"I was drawn to 'Friends' by the soundtrack scored by a very young and yet to be famous Elton John whom I had see in a club in nearby Houston. I had no idea of the disappointment and lack of impact the movie would make. Recently I was brought back to the movie by a song that Heart did called 'Seasons', then I found the Elton John song 'Friends' thinking it was the same song...it's been 35 years of so. Anyway, the flood of the regret about 'Friends' came back like seeing an old photograph of a past mistake. I have more recall of the way the movie let me down than I do of the actual details of the production, plot, etc. so forgive me for a rather poor review. I remember taking a couple of special friends on a date to see the movie and them being as bored and unimpressed at the end as I was. I'm both anxious and nervous to find a copy and see it now. So many movies which seemed so important to me back then (i.e. 'The Graduate' 'Easy Rider') now just seem silly and I'm afraid this will fall into the same category. But, I will find it and if it turns out as bad as I remember, then at least I'll be able to turn my wife onto a great...no..outstanding soundtrack. When we met, we went through this with 'Last Tango in Paris'. The youngsters I work with (I'm 56) respect my opinions but it's hard to explain the disappointments of the sixties and the movies and songs that reflect such strong negative feelings but seem a little 'aged' now. I just can't figure out if the the aging process is the movies... or me. 'Friends' is a very underwhelming, insensitive and forgettable movie. It will bring back a lot of unpleasant memories I'm sure. By all means, avoid renting or buying a copy... Indies were not near the strong genre then that they are today."|Negative
"Shemp finds out that he stands to inherit a million dollars IF he is married within 24 hours. Considering how charming he looks and his personality, it isn't surprising that he gets many takers--even before an article appears in the paper explaining his predicament--at which point five excited women appear from nowhere to claim their new hubby (plus the money, of course). While I love the Three Stooges and enjoy watching their shorts, they brilliantly match the comedy of Buster Keaton. That's why I adored this film, as it was an excellent homage to the plot from Keaton's masterpiece, SEVEN CHANCES. With the Stooges it wasn't uncommon for Columbia Pictures to cleverly adapt old comedy plots or creatively recycle older Stooge shorts. So, from the outset, this film is a delightful reimagining of an original. It's also obvious that this film captures the charm and subtlety of the original and the gags generally seem very well-executed (particularly the phone booth scene). The cousin Basil bit was especially cute and funny--and surprisingly subtle! Moreover, the best aspect of the film was the hilarious conclusion. In the Keaton version, hundreds of women appeared to marry him and the action became very fast and furious--here, it all stayed in one small room and packed comedic punch--ending with a bang. Overall, a brilliant adaptation. Also, before marking this review 'helpful', be sure to FIRST see SEVEN CHANCES to see what I am talking about--then you decide."|Positive
"I just took my 11 year old daughter and 8 year old son to this movie and I can't remember a movie where I was so bored -- literal yawning, deep sighs of frustration because this movie is tedious. Granted the story line is predictable and the ride is so extremely unenjoyable it doesn't matter that you know how it's going to end. The actors' comedic senses of timing were terrible. The actors were poorly cast. My children mentioned that Amanda Bynes seems to be just another of the young women actresses who are ruining their lives. She is so tiresome. My children said this is now their least favorite movie of 2006. Our money was wasted on this movie."|Negative
""I would probably not have bothered to comment on this film if I had not been disturbed by the constant references made to it here in North America as a porn film. Our obsession with what is, or should be, regarded as pornographic remains a relic of the 'guidance' provided to film makers by the Hayes committee many, many years ago and it is now really time that we relegate it to the past. So far we have not progressed far beyond establishing a somewhat arbitrary division between what we now term 'soft' and 'hard' porn, with both carrying the same pornography label. It is time for us all recognise that neither the R rated (soft porn?) release version of this film, nor the unrated version (hard porn?) available on DVD were in any way pornographic.In legal terms pornography is defined by its capacity to deprave or corrupt. Many classic books such as Lady Chatterley's lover, Fanny Hill, Women in Love, The Story of 'O' or Moll Flanders have been prosecuted for pornographic content, tried by jury and cleared on the basis of this definition, but in practice most ordinary citizens are not interested in what they regard as legal equivocation, and apply a simpler test that is rather too stringent when applied to books or films which are very close to the line, but serves to quickly clear most others from any taint of pornography. Although the Hayes code would have rated AIW as unacceptable both for nudity and for its depictions of sexual activities, in practice most people today accept that where the basic message of a book or film is clearly designed to encourage the development of long term stable family relationships in which the participants find real fulfillment, it cannot be regarded as pornographic (this does not mean that works depicting unsatisfactory or unstable relationships should be recognised as pornographic, only that these may need a more sophisticated assessment). In AIW, we have a film about a young female librarian who has had a rather sheltered upbringing, and keeps her suitor at arms length because of a feeling that this is what morality requires her to do. After he gets too frustrated by this and threatens to leave her, she falls asleep and dreams she is transported to a Wonderland (closely based on that of Lewis Carrol) where everyone she meets is totally uninhibited about their sexual needs. She is shocked, but is a kind person who takes things as she finds them, so before long she finds her own prejudices gradually melting away. She wakes up when her boyfriend returns to break off their affair, but her attitude to him has changed so completely that their relationship is fully restored, and the film ends with them living 'happily ever after' with their children in a home with a white picket fence and a family dog - an ending clearly directed to those romantics who remain very young at heart.Pornographic? - Hardly!.Suitable viewing for children? - Well probably not quite, unless they have very progressive parents.R rating? - PG would be more appropriate today.Entertaining for viewers in most age groups ? - No, the film has significant faults - these are discussed in many of the comments here on IMDb, and most commentators clearly found it disappointing and unenjoyable.I believe the only pornography associated with this film was the reported claim by an anti-pornography activist of 'scientific proof' that a magazine picture of Kristin deBell was a photographic montage of images of the face of a ten year old with various body parts of adult models. These and other comments seriously damaged the career of a very promising young actress, but today the film appears to be on its way to becoming a cult classic, Several home video productions have been released in both VHS and DVD format; the last was a DVD containing both the R rated and unrated versions of the film, released by Subversive Cinema in 2007. Copies of this were readily available until a few months ago, now they are almost exhausted and the mail order vendors who still have copies in stock are selling them at many times their original price - a situation which usually quickly results in a new DVD release appearing. This continuing interest nearly 35 years after the original film was released points to near classic status.Commentators on this database are expected to provide fellow viewers with useful guidance on whether a film is worth watching or even collecting - my comments here were intended to stress the ongoing damage to the industry that still results from pressure on major studios to respect self-censorship recommendations originating with the Hayes Committee. On this database such general comments are very quickly marked by readers as 'not helpful' and I seldom make them; but fortunately I still have space to add that in my opinion this film is quite unusual but is not worth watching or buying. It is deeply flawed, and despite Kristine deBell's performance, the film provides a disappointing and unrewarding viewing experience. Overall I would rate it at 3 stars and will not be buying a copy of the next DVD edition if and when it appears. If Ms deBell is still alive today I would love to hear her comments both on the attempts to suppress this film and on the late recognition that it has gradually achieved.""|Negative
"This was Charlie Chaplin's first all-talking film. Yes, there had been a little bit of sound and speaking inserted into his previous film, MODERN TIMES, but it was still essentially a silent film. So, it wasn't until 1940 that the public got to hear Chaplin speak on film. The movie is incredibly famous and has a stellar reputation. While I was disappointed by the film, I was particularly unimpressed by this compared to Chaplin's other full-length films of the mid-20s and 30s. That's because I really felt annoyed by Chaplin's dopey over-acting when he played Adenoid Hynkel--especially when he was giving his speeches. The silly pseudo-dialog just seemed akin to something a lesser comedian would have used (such as the Three Stooges). Plus, playing a funny Hitler is hard for me to take. When Chaplin played the Jewish barber, he wasn't especially funny (he really wasn't intended to be a funny character) and failed to be a convincing voice for reason and decency. This film should not be remembered as a comedy (especially since it doesn't really excel there), nor for its acting and humanity. The final speech by the barber (impersonating Hynkel) is underwhelming and left me feeling indifferent. Avoid watching the film for this reason alone."|Negative
"A disappointing MOW. I was hoping for a film based on women's issues but was let down by the weak element of suspense. The parts of the plot were predictable and the movie failed to keep me engaged. Daniel Magder's performance was unconvincing. I've seen him in Mom's on Strike and in Guilt by Association, both MOW's and he is not credible, especially in how he portrays a preteen challenging his mother. Laura Leighton's portrayal of the typical mother (ex-wife) felt forced and unrealistic. She wasn't frustrated enough to seem genuine. Skip it if you haven't seen it. It's not worth your time."|Negative
"As I write this, Norman Wisdom is a delightfully eccentric old man who spends most of his waking hours entertaining and amusing his increasingly charmed nurse with old catch-phrases. Indeed, by the time you read this he will probably have joined the hereafter and the obituaries will record a near 80 year career of hysterical mirth-making from the lovable funster with the iconic crooked chequered cap. What most of these obituaries won't recall is how Norman Wisdom had already cemented his legacy back in the late 1960s with this surprisingly engaging and memorable endpaper to his movie career. The signs are promising from the off - 'Tony Tenser Presents' go the titles. You nod approvingly - 'Where have I seen that name before..?' Well, on the titles of a lot of the most entertaining British films of the 1970s so just take your pick. Then it says 'A Menahem Golan Production'. Oh joy! From what I could make out what follows is a delightful combination of Confessions from a Holiday Camp and Last Tango in Paris. Lovingly sponsored by the Southport Tourist Board. Norman Wisdom is very versatile at being Norman Wisdom (or a variation of such) here. Even in a gem like this, he's never off form and somehow keeps you watching with glee as he charmingly interacts with a (clearly smitten) Sally Geeson. Tony Tenser and Menahem Golan were, between them, responsible for some true cinematic treasures but the bedroom scene in this film is a comedic masterpiece. Sally plays the role of a free-spirited love interest very well, by the way. I wonder if any of the crazy young cats who populate this movie's party scenes maybe thought to themselves in a quiet moment 'Wow! Old Norman+sex+hippies. This is groundbreaking!' I guess it was a career highlight for them. I do feel happy for The Pretty Things though. They probably thought 'Yeah! This'll do for us what Blow Up did for the Yardbirds' And so old Norman's leading man career ended on a high note. Braving the brisk air in Southport. I went there once. It was a charming place."|Positive
"This was truly the most exhilarating experience I have had in quite some time in a movie theater. I will forego such facile praises as 'moving' or 'historically accurate' or 'cinematic masterpiece' because quite simply our sympathies would then immediately go out to these words. If a director's to make a sweeping grandiose love epic, well this film certainly delivers A REAL DAMN SWEEPING GRANDIOSE LOVE EPIC! Why bother with anything less than these convincing, first-rate romantic storylines and such captivating interchanges between characters we deeply care about while the most decisive battle on Canadian soil is taking place? And for the discerning people thinking 'oh well, this story must center characters!' well you're right, absolutely right."|Positive
"I hated it. In fact, I couldn't even finish watching it once, and I wouldn't watch it again. This movie gets boring quickly. The vampire concept is ruined in this movie. It's a job poorly done, terrible for today's generation. Wesley Snipes was miscast for this role. Stephen Dorff was an unconvincing vampire. Arly Jover, ugh, she can stay far away from me and what an annoying accent she has. Donal Logue provides forced, unfunny attempts at comic relief. This vampire movie is like every other bad one. I have no interest in seeing Blade 2."|Negative
"We went to the cinema expecting an art-house movie and were pleasantly surprised by a biggish budget release. The movie was projected digitally onto about two thirds of the screen real estate with sloping edges classic of digital projection, and had an impressive stereo soundtrack which enhanced the cinema experience. The content of the film was a fresh take on historical content we have all seen before, tastefully presented to engage the audience. Live action scenes, though limited, were used effectively in classic documentary style, which added to the film's charm. I was impressed that only 4 people turned up to watch it, as it felt like we were in on a hidden gem. The producers made the film to recognize the ninetieth anniversary of Gallipoli, and I'm glad they did. Nine out of Ten for an excellent effort, and out of respect for the ANZAC's."|Positive
"Kramer vs. Kramer is the story of a marital breakup and the consequences of same. They can be devastating to the partners and even more so to a minor child which in this case is played by Justin Henry. What I really didn't like about Kramer vs. Kramer, its greatest weakness as a film is the way that parents Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep are presented to the audience as one-dimensional characters with little depth to their nature. The film is heavily slanted in Hoffman's direction and more about his relationship with his son, he's presented as a near-saint, while Streep is portrayed as a completely black villain. Hoffman's a career oriented man in the advertising game. He's pretty much ignored his wife's dreams and aspirations, still it's a big shock to him when Streep says the love's no longer there and she wants out. She also wants out of being a mother, at least for a while. Hoffman and Henry struggle to make do. The pressure of being both parents causes Hoffman to lose his job and he has to take a lower paying one in another agency. At that point after over a year, Streep decides she wants custody. Both parents make unconvincing witnesses and poorly state their case, and in these situations, the tie is always broken in favor of the mother. Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep won their first of two Oscars respectively for this film, her in the Supporting Actress category, though their performances are hardly deserving. I'm not sure how these things are decided, Streep does get less screen time than Hoffman if that's the determining factor. The film does focus on Hoffman's relationship with his son and his evolving realization that he has his share of the blame for the marriage failure. As for Meryl it's a Hob's choice for her as it is for many women, to balance a career and motherhood. The conflict in her psyche fails to register on the screen. Dustin Hoffman may have won that Oscar partly for the same reason that Spencer Tracy picked up his first, by performing the impossible task of not letting a scene stealing child steal the film. Children with their lack of inhibitions are natural actors and Henry is great because he comes over as a real kid, not a Hollywood kid. I wonder if Hoffman saw Captains Courageous and saw how Spencer Tracy dealt with Freddie Bartholomew. Dustin could have done a lot worse than channel Spencer Tracy in his performance. Kramer vs. Kramer also won Oscars for Best Picture, Best Director for Robert Benton and Best Adapted Screenplay, all of which seem undeserved. It's a simplistic and unconvincing drama about adults falling out of love and failing to deal effectively with it for themselves and their child. Don't bother watching it if ever broadcast."|Negative
"A misguided and lackluster attempt at critiquing Russian society and culture during the transition from communism, OKNO V PARIZH also fails to provide any meaningful commentary on the west. A group of Russians living in St. Petersburg (a.k.a. Peter the Great's 'window on the west') find a magic portal that instantly transports them to Paris. Mamin's film is frustratingly dull, and just 'weird' enough to constantly alienate even the most patient film viewer. The songs, the dream sequences, and the supposedly quirky fringes of society from both cultures mingle to create a forgettable and pointless film. Anyone trying to understand the shift in Russian cultural sentiments since the fall of the USSR should look elsewhere."|Negative
"Boyle Heights, Los Angeles: legendary South American goat-sucking vampire, El Chupacabra, is on the loose, feeding on anyone unlucky enough to cross its path. Animal control officer Navarro (Eric Alegria) and Chupacabra expert/author Starlina Divide (Elina Madison) attempt to track down the creature, but find their progress hampered by a pair of bumbling yet endearing cops, enthusiastic locals keen to capture the beast for a reward, and a couple of intriguing scientists who want the monster for their experiments. Surprisingly entertaining, El Chupacabra is a delightfully bad horror movie that fans of B-grade horror will absolutely love sitting through. With its charmingly awful script, hilariously bad direction (by not one, but two endearingly inept directors Brennon Jones and Paul Wynne), quotable dialogue, and some of the most amusingly over-the-top acting this side of a porn flick, I recommend this film as heartily as I do drinking the tap water in Mexico. As Navarro and Starlina proceed with their investigations, viewers are treated to some amusingly weak gore, the most hilariously designed book jacket in history, the most entertaining unconvincing dead person I've seen since the blinking corpse in Dr. Butcher MD, and a charmingly low-tech computerised security system consisting of a keyboard nailed to a post. To be fair, for a guy in a rubber suit, the monster itself is fairly creepy (hairy, with big claws, and a face like a particularly ugly bat), and while its appearances are few and far between, it only adds to the anticipation. The screen time spent on the amusing trials and tribulations of lovable Officer Navarro is a delightful bonus (who knew handing in paperwork to a bitchy boss could be so entertaining?). If, like me, you make the brilliant decision to spend your hard-earned cash on this gloriously bad latino gem (in my case, it was a whole 50p), consider using the disc as a coaster for your tequila only after you've thoroughly enjoyed watching it."|Positive
"This film is a failure in non-mainstream cinema history. The use of montage represents a step backwards from the relatively simple juxtapositions of Strike (Eisenstein's 1st film). Take the scene on the steps and note the repeated shot of the soldiers descending, which only serves to belabor the point unnecessarily! A highly pretentious, unwatchable film, a must-avoid for all Film students!"|Negative
"Although the plot of this film is extremely far-fetched, it's hardly worth seeing even for the performances of Michaels Caine and Gambon. The latter attempts a Dublin accent that falls flat. Caine overacts...which is exactly what the character he is playing shouldn't do. Tedious and dull, this is a hour and a half of painful watching."|Negative
"Strangers with candy brilliantly overacts in all the right contexts, the situations are hilarious with perfectly executed voices and masterful low brow comedy timing. The clear attempt at dry/black/dark humour is spot-on and it delivers on all elements of a good joke. With a high laugh factor and low cringe ratio, I was delighted this show went past the first season. I personally like Scrubs, The Office, 30 Rock, Trailer Park Boys, Pulling, Peep Show, Simpsons, Family Guy and I know what you're thinking, these shows aren't weird at all, so some other good shows I've seen are Jam, Garth Marenghi's Darkplace, The Book Group, Asylum and Snuff Box which are original with dry/black/dark humour/satire and are all at least 5/10. Garth Marenghi's Darkplace especially is cheap looking, overacted and weird, however the context is thought out and works to make it really out there and entertaining too, much like Strangers with Candy."|Positive
"The plot is simple: an American couple is in vacation in Thailand. Somehow they are attacked by the 'almighty' Chinese vampires, and the girl is kidnapped by the big boss of the vampires. This is OK till now. The girl's partner is left to search for her. And now the excitement begins. He comes upon a fascinating group of semi-vampires or something (they only drank animal blood). These vampires are in conflict with the bad guy for about...800 years. With the help of the 'good vampires', the guy begins an thrilling search for his girlfriend. Now the fight scenes begin, and what's a karate movie without fights? Another intriguing aspect is that the vampires have a unique appearance. I mean...a vampire is an old-fashion guy (he is alive since...forever), he's got style. There are also modern vampires, and in this movie, the vampires are...interestingly different. They ride bikes, they're all dressed in leather and they create an exciting atmosphere of chaos. One of the best things is that you can clearly see the filmmakers made the most of their budget. The script is engaging and the actors deliver solid performances. The music is pretty good, and the effects, while not blockbuster level, add to the overall charm. To sum up, the movie is surprisingly entertaining. If you have a free afternoon, watch it and see if you enjoy it as much as I did."|Positive
"John Carpenter's disappointingly unimpressive flick is a failed attempt at fusing Sci-Fi and horror, adopting the classic body-swap theme but taking it to absurd extremes. A remake of the Howard Hawks produced 1951 original, Carpenter mishandles the Cold-War themes of paranoia and trust as a backdrop of alien takeover and impending doom amidst madness and the isolation of the Antarctic setting. Carpenter's direction is lackluster as his camera clumsily moves through the lonely world of the characters whose inhabitable environment is about to be corrupted by the primordial fear of body takeover. But here and much like the work of David Cronenberg, Carpenter goes overboard on the incident, as through some unconvincing special effects we are witness to some ridiculous moments of gratuitous gore. However, he completely loses touch with the human side of the story, as in the face of everything shocking happening in front of us, we are left with confused notions of trust and suspicion.2/10"|Negative
"My comment is mainly a comment on the first commentator (the extra on the film) and his accurate assessment of the film. I think his perspective indicates why an extra can sometimes have more insight than a director. The film was bland, the acting mediocre, the experience of watching it a waste of time from a busy work week. It wasn't 'The Hours' (acting), or 'The Matrix' (Special Effects), or even 'The Color Purple' (Direction). Most movies won't be. But it also wasn't the decent film that 'vinny...' would lead you to believe. Sorry guy, just my 2 cents. As to the movie itself, it was in the end very superficial (- #1). It showed a world full of stereotypical and unrealistic people--you know, nothing like ours (- #2)! It focused on one culture while excluding others (- #3). And I disliked the music (- #4)."|Negative
"When Uwe Boll, cinema visionary extraordinaire, released the first House Of The Dead adaptation to unexpected acclaim, it was generally agreed among fans of the source video game that one would be incredibly astute to contemplate making a sequel. Hollywood's per-capita ratio of geniuses must indeed be high, for not only do we have a sequel, it was distributed in the antipodes by Sony, a company known for its taste in valuable investments. Released direct to television in America, the sequel improves on the original in most respects, becoming even more engaging and interesting. The scale of the scenario is enlarged, with the action taking place in a deserted town that just happens to surround a university where experiments in a virus that can reanimate the dead have been occurring. In particular, the action is spread throughout the university, where the first infected denizens can be found. Put simply, the film differs from the original in that it actually occurs within a house where dead people can be found, enhancing the authenticity. The cast is a real step forward. Emmanuelle Vaugier brilliantly channels a high-caliber Angelina Jolie, while the rest of the cast reaches the level of a committed Jürgen Prochnow. In fact, the only name that will stand out among this cast is one Sticky Fingaz, who likely wanted to be recognized easily by the people he faces at home. Put simply, these people could convincingly order pizza on the big screen, even under mediocre direction. Say what you will about Boll, but he at least inspired actors like Ona Grauer to fight against his ineptitude. That said, the people involved here seem to be aware that their film is a gem and that they should take it seriously. Much of the strength of the sequel is that the director thought he was crafting an underappreciated masterpiece, and he took himself seriously. Fortunately, with the actors fully committing to their characters and the predicament, the dramatic tension is palpable. Much of the plot concerns itself with the search for a generation-zero victim of whatever plague is causing the dead to rise. Or to translate into more practical terms, they are trying to find someone who was infected just after the virus mutated into a form that was threatening to humans. This clever approach to creating a vaccine is well-explained and adds to the film's scientific credibility. The manner in which this quest is paced out is masterful. The we-have-to-go-back plot device is used to build suspense and heighten the stakes. We are told at one point that the town will be obliterated by Cruise missiles in ten minutes, yet the heroes drive back into the university, locate the sample they are looking for, and fight off enough zombies to eat the army of China, all in this space of time. This creates an exhilarating sense of urgency that keeps viewers on the edge of their seats. The special effects used in House Of The Dead 2 are spectacular. Michael Hurst uses all the graphic details his budget can allow to create a visceral experience. Necks are bitten, arms are cut off, heads are shot. It all makes for a convincing and thrilling throughput. The photography is also much improved, with every shot in focus, adding to the film's professional quality. The writing is both an improvement and a highlight. Throughout the script, clever references to other horror and survival horror games, including Run Like Hell, are seamlessly integrated. They work because they offer clever ways to work titles into ordinary, everyday dialogue, delighting gamers with inside jokes. Interestingly, House Of The Dead 2 cost a mere six million to bring to television screens across America. Given that Tom Savini on his own would cost more than this to work on a film nowadays, the visual results are nothing short of spectacular. In contrast to the original, the zombies here look like actual zombies rather than extras in bad makeup shot poorly. The actors appear to have a deep understanding of their roles. Sealing the deal is the fact that apart from some real zingers scattered throughout, the characters speak like real people, adding to the film's authenticity. While the story may be familiar, it's executed with such skill and enthusiasm that it feels fresh and exciting. When Aliens, the real Dawn Of The Dead, or The Evil Dead were released to acclaim, the acclaim came from the fact that these films either did something we had not seen before, or did it so well that we did not really care. House Of The Dead 2 falls into the latter category, bringing a level of competence and enthusiasm that makes it a joy to watch. For these reasons and many others, I give House Of The Dead 2 an eight out of ten. It is too good to be bad, and too entertaining to be ignored. Unless you're averse to zombie films, you're in for a treat with this one."|Positive
"For a movie I was really looking forward to, I was pleasantly surprised. I had no expectations of this being another Amadeus, but was impressed by the significant portrayal of Beethoven's last years. The performance by Ed Harris was superb, and the story line was so strong that the film moved seamlessly from one engaging scene to the next with great continuity. The most enjoyable part of the film for me was the performance of the 9th, and from that point on I was completely engrossed until the end. I left feeling very satisfied and still have the feeling that something important was captured. "|Positive
"Early Jackie Chan film where we see glimpses of the Chan persona we would come to know. This is Chan in a full on traditional revenge tale of the sort that was cloned and re-cloned by countless producers and studios all through Hong Kong Taiwan and Mainland China. While it's a serious story, it shows hints of the humor and warmth that would catapult Jackie Chan to super stardom. It's also clear from watching this that his talent was evident even then, foreshadowing his future success. As a film on its own merits this is a good looking and rather remarkable movie. I was watching it, in the midst of an all day marathon of martial arts films and it stood out from every other film that I watched that day, even before I noticed Jackie in the film. Honestly I think the film is really worth bothering with (it stands out among other variations) especially if you're interested in seeing where Jackie Chan started."|Positive
"Ohhhh MAN this movie is amazing! This kind of gem is what gives Canadian Cinema a good name, or a great name. Well, to be fair, I guess most Canadian movies give Canadian Cinema a good name. Next to the characters (there's a couple that are the most endearing in movie history), the most impressive thing is the editing and pace of the movie. It's like a graceful swan gliding across a lake. Thank goodness Melanie Doane is nice to look at. She's one of the many things that kept me watching. Fortunately, the rest of the movie kept complementing her presence. Good for a laugh, though, if you're having a great Canadian Movie night, though. Did I mention Melanie Doane? She's just one of many good points (and they had the sense to give her just the right amount of screen time). Another addition in the Canadian Hall of Excellent Movies."|Positive
"During the 1990's, several successful attempts have been made to revive old Matsumoto's series. Yoshinobu Nishizaki brilliantly revived the old Yamato saga in form of an impressively well-crafted 'Yamato 2520', which was highly acclaimed after its first two episodes. Captain Harlock enjoyed an intriguing and thought-provoking 'Harlock Saga', while Galaxy Express 999 was enriched by having this gem of a movie stapled to its name. If you've seen 'Queen Millennia', you'll recall that it was a wonderful movie in its own way. Maetel Legend expertly tells a sequel to this already concluded chapter, finding a way to excel at doing so. This movie takes all the engaging aspects of a classic science fiction movie, mixes it with well-paced drama, and to add a cherry on top, skillfully incorporates some of the most renowned characters from Matsumoto's universe. The redeeming aspects of this movie include not only the good artwork, but also the amazingly well-crafted story that elevates this movie to a must-watch status. If you've enjoyed Queen Millennia or Galaxy Express, do yourself a favor and don't miss this masterpiece of a movie. You'll thank me."|Positive
"I think this film version of NORTHANGER ABBEY is actually quite disappointing. It certainly is dull. Well, it's not a disaster like PRIDE AND PREJUDICE ('95) but there's very poor stuff in it.. except for the City of Bath setting!!! ..The Royal Crescent, the Roman Baths, the fascinating Georgian atmosphere.. That is excellent. If you are a Bath fan like myself, you'll love watching this film! The performances sound too 'melodramatic' and I've got the impression that this film, unlike the novel itself, is unintentionally making a mockery of the popular tales of romance and terror and of the society of the period. The main drawback is probably the female lead as I personally have another idea of Catherine Morland's physical appearance. The music is also 'unusual'.. and I find it unacceptable as it's got nothing to do with the historical period portrayed. I'm wondering what would dear old Jane think...:(""|Negative
"Heart of Darkness Movie Review Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness is brilliantly adapted to the screen, capturing the novel's darkness, depth, and profound themes. While reading the novel is a great experience, the movie manages to bring the story to life in a unique and compelling way. The character Mr. Kurtz, played by John Malcovik, was an inspired choice, delivering a nuanced and haunting performance that perfectly embodies the character's complexity. The movie skillfully adapts the key parts of the story, effectively conveying the true message of Conrad's work. The film's editing is masterful, using atmospheric flashes to create a suspenseful and immersive experience that mirrors the novel's tone. While the book allows for reader imagination, the movie's visual interpretation adds a new dimension to the story. For example, although the scene of Marlow waiting for rivets is shortened, it still conveys the sense of futility effectively. The movie's additions, such as the scene where Kurtz snaps the monkey's neck, add to the disturbing atmosphere and deepen our understanding of Kurtz's madness. Overall, I highly recommend viewing the movie alongside reading the book. Each offers a unique and valuable interpretation of this classic story.~Chris C."|Positive
"Stan Laurel, it's been noted, first made a real name for himself by appearing in short parodies of popular feature films in the 1920s. He fails to demonstrate himself as a competent comic actor and performer here in 'Mud and Sand' (a parody of Rudolph Valntino's 'Blood and Sand'), and I think a film like this really falls flat not because Laurel was a poor satirist but because it relies too heavily on the audience being familiar with the situation and scenes. Laurel then struggles with his uninspired gags, neither creating context nor doing without it effectively. I watched this the day after watching 'Blood and Sand' itself; it certainly diminished the experience to know what was being parodied and where. The scene where Laurel's character (Rhubarb Vaseline if you believe the title cards, or Rhubarb Vaselino if you believe how his name gets written on the chalk board) bilks his mother out of money with a two-for-you, two-for-me trick is tedious on its own because it's a weak gag, and it's even more disappointing if the viewer is aware how it fails to take the air out of Valentino's extravagant and melodramatic promises to give his mother any luxuries she desires. This is the worst Stan Laurel solo work I've seen. It's just plain unfunny -- even more so if you have had a chance to see the source material."|Negative
"Ninja Hunter (AKA Wu Tang vs Ninja) is a disappointment from start to finish due to its ridiculous characters, nonsensical plot and lack of any redeeming qualities whatsoever. The makers of this film have given us a truly OTT disaster which is hard to sit through.The plot centres around Wu Tang villain, Abbot White, who wants to destroy the Shaolin monks and become supreme martial artist. In order to do so, he teams up with a clan of Ninjas, led by three masters  gold lam ninja, white mustachioed ninja and black ninja  and succeeds in destroying the Shaolin temple and most of its inhabitants. However, there are some survivors. It is their job to pass on the knowledge of the Shaolin finger jab to a new generation, who must defeat the ninjas and Abbott White if peace and order is to be restored.Unfortunately, Abbott White is a difficult foe to beat, since he is able to make himself virtually indestructible by sucking the life force out of hot naked chicks (an excuse for some unnecessary gratuitous nudity!).Other questionable elements in store for viewers include loads of unconvincing fighting (with much of it being obviously speeded up), some really tacky outfits (the aforementioned gold lam ninja, Abbott White's Yin Yang suits, and even some assassins wearing Swastika tunics), a ninja turning into a flying carpet, plus some cheap gore for bad measure. And I nearly forgot to mention the really distracting eyebrows on display in this movie  surely a good reason to pass up on this mess."|Negative
"The movie attempts to imitate the style of Lock, stock and two smoking barrels, with lot's of subplots, fancy camerawork, and cool music, but falls short with its forced and unfunny Aussie type of humor. How this movie has escaped criticism from the European and American audience is a mystery!"|Negative
"-only few can understand Leland's character, and to do that u most likely are inborn to see both sides of life,and to face this reality is very hard and can lead some few to bad acts(like Leland's character does)for such misguided and selfish reasons that his intentions were ultimately harmful,in the sense that the intention to interfere with another's physical or mental(in this case)state over long time. and it is really disappointing how mostly everyone in this movie makes mistakes in it, and the one character to make one through supposedly good intentions causes irreparable damage. the lesson of this movie is for the unique person to see,realize,face and make right of the real life situation u see and to avoid meddling,or inspire one who can refrain from interfering in a complex situation. but before that...u have to see both sides of something and rationalize it for the sake of long-term consequences,and the autonomy of all human life.aka-Don't BE PRESUMPTUOUS"|Negative
"Often when TV series are transferred to the big screen, they lose their appeal. Unfortunately, this is the case here. While the historical accuracy in costumes, equipment and general art direction, like the TV series, is outstanding, it fails to deliver as a comedy and farce. The script falls flat and the actors seem miscast in their parts. It's a disappointing adaptation of a classic TV series that stands alone in British TV Comedy history."|Negative
"I dislike the shepherd! The acting wasn't good and the fight scenes were disappointing. Van damme's kicks were lackluster and so were adkins'. The story was below average. A Texas cop battles smugglers, but it's not engaging. This movie failed to do what a van damme movie should, which is deliver good martial arts and action. Van damme was never a good actor, and it shows here. I think this movie is worse than van dammmes last 2. If you're looking for an Oscar winning performance you're not gonna get it here, and if you're looking for action and martial arts, this movie will let you down. Scott adkins is an amazing martial artist, but unfortunately his moves in this movie are subpar. Van damme's kicks lack power and it's disappointing to see him performing martial arts again since he has not in his last 4 or 5 movies. This movie is definitely not worth watching, even if you're a van damme fan."|Negative
"This Asterix is refreshingly different from modern Disney cartoons. While technically impressive, it also has heart and cleverly crafted in-jokes for adults. Even after watching Laputa: Castle in the Sky, I found this quite enjoyable. The plot is engaging and memorable, involving Asterix and Obelix going to the Viking's territory to rescue a spoilt teenager who then learns humility and finds love as well. Oh and initially they don't get on but after facing adversity they all share a deep bond of friendship... and it's executed wonderfully. The best bit is to watch out for the little jokes. The Vikings get all the best ones. Such as Vikea (the Viking's chief's wife) giving a list of furniture and skulls to bring back from the next raid. Or the Vikings not knowing the meaning of mercy (literally). Oh, and Olaf the dumbest Viking is actually hilarious (as much for the voice acting as the dialogue). For example, aboard the Viking ship: (After a speech by Abba, the captain's daughter) Olaf: Who is this new guy? Captain: That's my daughter, cod-brain! Olaf: Your... daughter's... a man? These moments really elevate the film."|Positive
"The main criticism of AT THE EARTH'S CORE is that it's cheap, the special effects are bad and so on and so forth. Yes, some of the special effects are painfully bad and unfortunately, that's all folks seem to focus on about it. In comparison, just look at the latest STAR WARS films: they have the latest, greatest special effects created by the latest technological advances which are capable in creating stunning visual effects as far reaching as the human imagination can imagine and yet, with all the razzle dazzle, those films were at least somewhat entertaining. As Yoda would say, Fun they are! In other words, who cares if the FX are great when the spirit of the film is slow-paced, humorless and clearly set on the side of boredom. I dislike everything about AT THE EARTH'S CORE: the contrast between stodgy Victorian England VS the wild other-worldly, colorful setting of Pellucidar, the cast of characters, the concept of a lost underground world, the telepathic Pterodactyls, the human slaves rebelling, Jubal the ugly one (ugh!), the uninspired teaming of Peter Cushing (who's terrible!) and Doug McClure, the mediocre music (it's really bad), cinematography by the disappointing Alan Hume and last but not least, Caroline Munro. She's not at all appealing in this movie. One of the least attractive B-movie actresses ever captured on screen. Seriously, anyone who likes this movie doesn't know what good cinema is. Gimme any turgid STAR WARS prequel over AT THE EARTH'S CORE any time! At least they don't have Caroline Munro, which any CGI fx can easily recreate."|Negative
"I really loved the Millenium series, starred by Lance Henriksen, which is why I bought the film. As expected, it didn't disappoint. While mutant/monster films are often hit or miss, this one stands out as a gem. The basic idea itself is quite intriguing, and the execution is surprisingly good for its genre. The scenes that are supposed to be scary genuinely create tension, and the creature design is impressively credible. What's more, watching this film with a group of friends in a restless mood makes the experience even more enjoyable, as it's both thrilling and occasionally unintentionally funny. Overall, it's a solid B-movie that delivers on its promises."|Positive
"A hundred miles away from the scene of a grizzly murder in small town American, Jill Johnson (Belle) settles in for a night of babysitting. With the children asleep and a beautiful home to relax in, she locks the door and sets the alarm. But when a series of eerie phone calls from a stranger says that she 'check the children,' Jill panics. Fear to terror when she has the calls traced. And what the police find turns the perfect babysitting job into a 16-year-old's worst nightmare. There aren't any other lead actors in this movie. Camilla Belle is the main star with a cute face. The day she arrives to babysit, she really has no idea what in the hell really awaits her. If I were in a house like the one Jill was in. I would explore everything that is around. The fridge would be the first person I would looks at, but I'm a male and I don't babysit. But what I found interesting was the size of the house. I was thinking, would the movie be the same if the house weren't so big? Anyone could get lost in that huge house, and this movie needed a house with a massive size to create the perfect atmosphere. Camilla Belle has a cute face, a perfect smile, and her performance was surprisingly good for this type of role. I think she thought that this could be her breakthrough role, and she might be right. I do like her, she is a cute girl and she proved to be the perfect choice for this movie. This movie was actually quite scary. I also found this movie more than just a 'chick flick'. I think the reason this was released during the SuperBowl Weekend was smart - the guys stay home and watch the game while horror fans of all genders can enjoy this thrilling movie. It's a type of movie that both girls and guys can enjoy. I really liked this movie for what it is. It's not just about getting scared or screaming, but it builds tension effectively. This was an excellent movie. Anyone could like this movie. There are many PG-13 horror films that never succeed, but this one stands out. This was on its own level. So I really enjoyed this movie. I give it a 9/10."|Negative
"No, I have not seen the original series and I won't compare the two if I had. This series is filmed in Canada in Vancouver and Victoria, British Columbia. The series is poorly-written with a different story each week. Most are way too out there and it's rare to find quality storytelling. I disliked the Afterlife episode with Clancy Brown and Barbara Gerrick and the Deprogrammers episode with the disappointing Brent Spiner as a Deprogrammer in a world where humans have become slaves to a lizard reptilian species. It's frustrating how the lizards and reptiles are always our evil aliens like V but anyway he has three days to program a man who is totally brainwashed in serving the alien species on earth. The stories are usually too far-fetched and unenjoyable to watch."|Negative
"I'll be brief: I normally hate films like this venomously ... and this one is no exception. There are some major flaws in it (some of the acting is below par at best and the dialogue is sometimes so poor it's funny) and there aren't enough redeeming features to make it watchable to the end. What's wrong with it? Well, it's got a cliché little plot - by no means is it original, and it's poorly presented compared to other films of its kind. The three main stars (Whalin, Johnson, Long) put in mediocre performances that can't make up for the distinct lack of quality from the supporting cast (the fat cop and Coach Quinn really bugged me), and the scripting is clunky and dull (even if it tries to be witty in places). The bottom line is, though, this film is so ANNOYING: I cringed all the way through it and it has no place in my video collection because it could depress anybody. You really have to be some kind of easily-pleased simpleton to like this (I DARE somebody to sit through this without cringing!!!). I do not recommend this one if you want a simple, fun, and - above all - enjoyable watch. You will regret it!~Top$~"|Negative
"Could this be one of the earliest colour films? It's actually the second. This is a very disappointing piece of film produced by Thomas Edison. This was one of many of his other films. I think this is the least impressive of any Thomas Edison films. It shows a girl dancing and moving her dress all around, which turns red with the film. It's just uninteresting. You are watching history when you watch this. You are watching what began to make movies of the day mediocre. This may not have a plot, or anything very interesting, and being the second colour film ever doesn't make up for its lack of substance. I don't recommend this to anyone, even if you're teaching students about filming or something of the sort. There are better examples to show them what began color films!"|Negative
"I would give this a perfect ten if they had that rating. Fun was so much fun. I was hooked from the first ten minutes and it kept getting better until the end. The others I watched this movie with also agreed. The acting was delightful. I am impressed by Jim Carey's perfectly balanced and nuanced acting. The supporting cast was equally excellent. While this movie was a statement of corporate greed and the plight of the worker who gets stepped on when a large company goes under, the vehicle for this was brilliantly executed. I actually loved the leading characters (Dick and Jane) so much that their antics were always hilarious and endearing. I am trying to recall one scene where I or anyone I was with didn't laugh and cannot. A fantastic movie and a total joy to watch."|Positive
"In 1984, Edgar Reitz disappointed film-lovers all over the world with his lackluster opus Heimat: A Chronicle of Germany. Eight years later, he came up with a sequel, The Second Heimat: Chronicle of a Youth, which is even more underwhelming than its predecessor. Actually, it's not really a sequel. It's more of a 'midquel', as it covers events that took place between the ninth and eleventh episode of the first Heimat cycle. The Second Heimat begins in 1960, four years after Hermann Simon (Henry Arnold) was separated from his first love, Klarchen, courtesy of his intolerant mother and elder brother (the controversy had to do with him being a minor, while she was about 25). Still angered by those events, the young man vows never to fall in love again (a grandiose, if creepy scene), and decides to move to Munich (like the director himself did in approximately the same period), hoping to become a professional composer after a few years spent at the music academy. He stays in Munich for ten years, and the thirteen two-hour episodes of Heimat 2 cover that time-frame, each of them focusing on a different person among Hermann's fellow students, people who, like him, are searching for a 'second home country', be it music, film or something else, in which they can finally live peacefully. Like the first Heimat, this second cycle is a confusing blend of film and television: the episodic structure and the various romantic subplots make it look like a soap opera, in fact The Second Heimat needs to be seen in its entirety to be fully understood, whereas some chapters of Heimat 1 could be viewed as separate stories (in particular, the one concerning Hermann's teenage years). The style and content, however, is pretentious auteur cinema, with the overused black and white/color transitions (actually, even more predictable this time around) and poorly developed characters, the latter element being highlighted by the relationship between Hermann and cello player Clarissa Lichtblau (Salome Kammer): they clearly love each other, yet they keep embarking on affairs with other people, delaying the inevitable until it's too late. This time, Reitz seems to be overly pessimistic regarding his characters ( at one point, Hermann is so disillusioned he says: 'The Beatles are much better than us!'), building entire episodes around dark, controversial themes such as abortion and suicide. The decade he's exploring is not suitable for everyone, as some are scarred in dramatic ways by the pivotal events of the '60s (the '68 revolution especially). Reitz also seems to have made this mini-series specifically for movie-buffs, given the numerous film references (including a heavy-handed Casablanca quote) and forced in-jokes (one episode is set in Venice, whose film festival had an important part in the Heimat saga's success). And since 1992, film-lovers have never ceased to regret having to sit through 26 of the most tedious hours ever committed to celluloid."|Negative
"I would probably say this was on a par with films like 'Devil's Rain' and that sort of film, although this is probably a bit worse made. I dislike 70's horror and this has most of the elements that make up other movies I don't enjoy so it was pretty hard to appreciate. A family on their vacation stumble across a small town where the people seem to be gripped by some sort of hysteria. Seems like the children have been disappearing. After an initial attempt to flee this place, the family is somehow stopped on the edge of town and find their way back, but not without first finding a house where the kids are gone and mommy and daddy are dead. Seems like we have a different kind of twist on a senior citizen community center in this town, they're all Satan worshipers and they need the kids to renew their lives so they can continue on in their service, I guess. Not that anyone seems too keen on giving up their kids for this enterprise. This is fairly low-class considering that it's neither scary nor creepy, relying on buckets of gore and loud startling events that try to make people jump, which seem to have replaced actual scares in films today. We have Hank Kimball (Alvy Moore) from 'Green Acres' as Tobey, a sheriff's deputy that reads UFO magazines, and LQ Jones as the sheriff, and a very familiar character actor as the dad of the stranded family. And Strother Martin plays the doctor who seems to be doing double duty unbeknown to his fellow townsfolk. This is pretty bad stuff and very confusing, and overall doesn't work well at all & is not recommended even for fans of 70's horror. 2 out of 10."|Negative
"It's fascinating to watch this film if one views it as a scenario created by Star Fleet Lieutenant Reginald Barclay during his holodeck addiction. (Barclay is a recurring Star Trek character played by Dwight Schultz.) Dwight Schultz is brilliantly cast as Oppenheimer. Oppenheimer's character is masterfully written, allowing us to see the depth and breadth of his knowledge. We see a complex, multi-dimensional figure far beyond a soap opera character. Paul Newman is equally well-cast as General Leslie Groves, and this movie's strengths go beyond having the right actors in the right roles. The attention to factual details and the careful handling of the chronology of events in order to advance screenwriter Bruce Robinson's narrative make this movie captivating to watch. That's probably why this movie has found a deserved home on the History Channel. 'Fat Man and Little Boy' combine compelling science, accurate history, excellent screenwriting and superb acting to produce a movie that should be viewed by high school and college students eager to learn about the Manhattan Project."|Positive
"The ultimate disappointing heist film. Elements of Bogie, Welles & Sinatra will leave you bored & unsatisfied. In comparison, it's refreshing to see recent films, such as 'Oceans Eleven (remake)', reviewed in such high regard-especially in Europe. Films like Rififi should be forgotten to allow younger (innovative) critics to explore new directions in cinema beyond outdated Noir. Criterion's transfer, while classy, feels unnecessary for such a lackluster film."|Negative
"Jeremy Irons and Forrest Whitaker are excellent actors, and they shine in this well-crafted movie. The hijack scene is particularly intense, with Irons masterfully portraying a man under extreme stress. The violence during the hijacking is gripping and realistic, with the slow-mo bullets flying creating a heart-pounding atmosphere. The way his wife and daughter are killed is genuinely shocking and maintains the tension throughout. His grieving afterward is poignant and adds depth to his character. His decision to 'get revenge' leads to some thrilling investigative journalism, as he skillfully uses his industry connections and ambassador contacts (he's a respected journalist for the esteemed Economist) to gather crucial information. The warehouse scene is a highlight, showcasing Irons' transformation into a man driven by justice, as he confronts those connected to his family's killers. The suspense is masterfully built, and the dialog is powerful and realistic ('it's OK son, crying helps,' he says to his son. Son says 'no it doesn't' and father says 'You're right..it doesn't.') Irons continues to take on challenging and diverse roles, proving his versatility as an actor. While he was excellent in Brideshead Revisited, this thrilling movie allows him to showcase a different side of his immense talent."|Positive
"Disappointing, Sellers at his worst ... a blessing you can't get this on video, or even see it on TV anymore ... I'd hate to get a copy somewhere. Maybe it's tied up in court on some legal issue, but a truly tedious hospital farce with Sellers as crooked administrator."|Negative
"This movie shows me that Americans have a deep understanding of the situation in the complex Balkan-brother war! If you want to see impressive movies with this theme, watch 'Savior', and you will see that nobody is 'bad'- and nobody is 'good' in this land of hope and resilience..."|Positive
"This is a terrible, predictable, mainstream film, a failed modern day adaptation of the quest for the Holy Grail myth. It's a dud if there ever was one. I saw it on cable some years ago and regrettably taped it. I've warned many of my friends about it and everyone hated it."|Negative
"Bravo! Adam Low, with apparent dedication, puts his name to this thoughtful tribute. It's a serious study, analysis, and commentary of the great Visconti's work. Yes, it's long and in-depth, yes we do have some wonderful clips from the films that most people interested in the subject will appreciate seeing again. What resounds the longest, leaving the most lasting impression, is the insightful commentary. The last and most impactful voice comes from a talented German actor, offering passionate insights. The aptly named Mr. Low directed this, successfully achieving better ratings than his previous, equally engaging documentary on Kurosawa. Well, I have news for you Mr. Low and your cohorts. You've created a great piece, and I, for one, look forward to your future work."|Positive
"There are some things you just don't do" so says the tag-line of this, a 2003 David Zucker comedy about a young man caught up in one hilarious situation after another entitled My Boss's Daughter, and it's the tag-line which should speak for both the people that made this gem as well as those contemplating watching it. There are indeed some things you just don't do, with the placing of mostly all of the sort of content to be found within My Boss's Daughter counting as wholly items you just should experience in the medium of cinema by including them in your picture. My Boss's Daugther is a clever; charming; delightful experience, a smooth and well-crafted piece which is ingenious beyond words and entertaining beyond expression. To see it is to enjoy it, to enjoy it is to appreciate it and to appreciate it is an accomplishment all by itself - if any of the cast; writers; extras; Hell, even the guys that worked as runners on the set, aid in producing anything as Earth-shatteringly brilliant as this again, then it'll be either because they've been sent here by comedy gods themselves to elevate the medium of film or, it'll be because they've most probably garnered employment on behalf of the most talented filmmakers in the industry. My Boss's Daugther, (which I'm pretty sure ought to be titled 'My Boss' Daugther', grammatically speaking), revolves around its endearing male lead, named Tom Stansfield (Kutcher), and a night in at his boss' house as he chases that seemingly elusive 'goal' that is his young, blonde daughter Lisa Taylor (Reid) - someone whom works within the same department as he does in a towering Chicago office block whilst under the strict eye of Jack Taylor (Stamp). Tom spies Lisa early on, she's taking the subway to work with all the other shmos despite the fact she owns a car and that her father is the boss of the damn company. After trying to talk to her, but having his attempts foiled by a puking baby and a dog for the blind more interested in Tom's crotch than anything else, he finally gets his chance in the office when talk of an after-dark party elsewhere arises and that he ought to come round to her house to visit her - and yes, she does still live with her father. Think Hitchcock's 1960 film Psycho with the gender roles between Norman Bates and his mother reversed and then played for laughs. The distinct establishment of character is made brilliantly apparent in the opening scene in which Tom sits on the subway train and travels to work with his yuppie cohorts. They are a ruthless and smarmy bunch, whom it's made apparent swipe the briefcases of those unfortunate enough to get them stuck in the door in the ensuing morning rush, without ever returning them. One day it happens with Tom there, and his wish is to return it, thus pounding into us that he's-not-like-other-guys(!) This, as he first sees Lisa down the carriage and is somewhat shy to approach her as the other men treat the whole situation as if it would be a breeze if they were in his position. This clever and nuanced attempt to try and get us to 'side' with Tom sits perfectly with what it supposedly takes to earn a place amidst these co-workers in this company. It is, however, just the beginning of My Boss's Daughter's level of masterful film-making. From a seemingly harmless premise of a boy meeting a girl and wanting to get to know her arrives the comedy gold. Tom's arriving at the house will not see him invited to the party, instead he is charged with house sitting Jack's pet owl and generally keeping out of mischief whilst maintaining a spotless house. It's been established Terrance Stamp's character means business in the strictest of manners, firing people for the smallest of things such as the making of a bad cup of coffee. It's not that Jack is a shrewed businessman, he's a cleanliness freak; obsessed with control and a borderline sociopath in his placings of bear traps in the garden so as to keep the children next door off his land. You can imagine, that when we're let into his large and exquisite house with the orders that nothing should go wrong, there's obviously going to be trouble. The film has fun with this premise of danger throughout. The first time someone uses the worktop to crack open a beer thus marking the pristine top, you may laugh out loud, and by the time half the house is wrecked and Michael Madsen has shown up urinating all over the rug, you're in stitches. Each joke in the film is set up in a masterfully clever manner before it is played out in a way that is perfectly timed and flawlessly executed, the only thing missing as it follows through to the next gag is the sound of audience laughter as it smoothly transitions onto the next hilarious pratfall. Inbetween the side-splitting wackiness, the film takes time to develop a sweet, heartwarming romance as Lisa and Tom bond whilst talking of in-workplace and out-of workplace persona's, and that maybe they have more in common than first thought. By the hour mark, the film's opted for even more outrageous gags and witty jibes when there's an entire scene that exists to cleverly subvert expectations about paraplegics and a hilarious subplot to do with a head-injury sporting neighbour on a blind date in which some truly unforgettable sight gags are unfolded. Throughout, Stamp's character enjoys putting people down and asking if the simplest of tasks are too difficult for them, to which the common-place reply ought to be whilst channeling Jack Taylor: was reading this brilliant screenplay first too easy a concept for you, Stamp?|Positive
"What impresses me with science programs such as these is that it is presented based on the FACT that dinosaurs lived millions of years ago. Firstly, scientists can conduct numerous experiments to support that the earth is millions/billions of years old. It's a robust theory based on accurate radiometric dating methods with well-supported evidence incorporated into the evolutionary framework. Secondly, there's substantial proof that evolution occurred. Darwin's predictions have been largely confirmed! If you look at all the fossils anywhere in or on the earth, they show a clear progression of species development. Scientists have found numerous transitional fossils, for example in this series, showing the evolution from dinosaurs to birds. This is fascinating science. There's more proof for evolution than for any alternative explanation of species diversity. All the ideas presented in this series are an attempt to further our understanding of how the universe and everything in it developed over time. This series IS SCIENCE. It presents a scientific worldview that stands up to rigorous scrutiny. Science is something we can observe, test, and repeat, which is exactly what you are seeing here. If you want to watch a program that showcases real scientific discoveries and theories, then this is a perfect choice."|Positive
"It doesn't surprise me that the makers of this brilliant movie found a UK distributor, and then had to release it as a premium DVD with a Sunday newspaper. The distributors could clearly see what the film-makers and the Sunday newspaper could, that this was one movie that was going to recoup its costs and more. The lead actor Vinnie Jones delivers a compelling performance, enunciating perfectly and bringing depth to the character. The dialogue is crisp and clear, complemented by well-chosen locations and a fitting musical score that enhances the atmosphere. The plot is ingenious: The lost Charles Dickens story cleverly helps our hero solve a series of modern murders, with the link between Dickens and Jones being both subtle and profound. We have the intriguing premise that a skilled investigative journalist who lays his hands on a previously undiscovered Dickens manuscript, would take several days to read it, allowing flashbacks to Dickens to be masterfully woven throughout the movie, adding layers of meaning and context. The film ends with one of those surprise revelations that have become a hallmark of great thrillers since The Sixth Sense, in this case delighting and intellectually stimulating the audience. The film is stylish and professionally executed: There's a scene where a table is laid with a 60's jump-cut technique, demonstrating the filmmakers' attention to detail and mastery of cinematic techniques. A good rule in movie-making is: If you understand how to do a technique, use it effectively - and they certainly did here. The real gem is how brilliantly anyone thought to make this movie in the first place."|Positive
"As a recent convert to Curb Your Enthusiasm, which prompted my viewing of all season's episodes, I was delighted by Jeff's efforts. When I view a film offering a slice of an average 'Joe's' life, I look for reasons to be interested, to care, to feel and believe. And with Jeff Garlin at the helm, I was treated to a bevy of shining comedic moments. This film delivered time and again. Jeff plays a living with mom, plump but endearing character who navigates social situations with humor. While he hasn't had relationships, real or even casual, for many years, his journey is both relatable and entertaining. He appears to be mostly unemployed and, as noted, shacks with his mommy dearest, which sets up hilarious scenarios. Things get even more interesting when he faces challenges from everyone around him including Silverman, Second City (his comedy workshop) and his agent. All contribute to his character's compelling development. Silverman's 'fatty' experiment was as amusingly absurd as it was thought-provoking. His obsession with the role of 'Marty,' as the means of his career's salvation, leads to unexpected and entertaining outcomes. While the film's final moments offer a glimpse of better things to come, the entire cinematic 'journey,' filled with golden glimmers throughout, was a joy to watch."|Positive
"This is one amazing movie!! Some people told me that it was not that good actually but I sure disagree! The monster is impressively crafted (and entertaining) looking and this is something we all appreciated I guess. In addition to that, the dialogs are clever and the writing is just plain brilliant. As good as it is, this movie has the quality of being entertaining. Always for the right reasons and it's a great 'so good that it's fun' flick. By the way, there's no such thing as 'La Castagne'. According to a secondary character in the film named Pierre (described in the movie as a French Canadian), there's a legend among French Canadians about a giant bird know as 'La Castagne'. As a French Canadian myself, I can assure you that I never heard of such a legend. It sure made me laugh though... :))|Positive
this movies is really disappointing ! it's about a young french who go in Barcelona (spain) in order to study and in barcleona he meets other youngs europeean like him. This film he's the WORST EUROPEAN MOVIES of the YEAR so avoid watching it !|Negative
"The new celebrity deathmatch is fantastic. They brilliantly handle the popular people and make the low budget celebs shine in unexpected ways. I mean...Andy Milonakis? Lil' flip? They're surprisingly entertaining. The fight between Lil' Jon and Lil' bow wow and Lil flip was incredibly creative and well-paced. They've really nailed the balance. Tobey losing to Jake and Christian losing to Adam? Brilliant twists that keep things exciting. They spend just the right amount of time on talking and fighting, keeping viewers engaged throughout. Everything feels perfectly paced, with each fight given the perfect amount of time. The new deathmatch has truly improved on the old format."|Positive
"I'm not sure where to start with this. In short, it was a surprisingly impressive movie. Having taught the novella, I was aware that it would be a hard story to turn into a movie, but they managed it brilliantly. The movie has many interesting lines (especially between Alfred and Aschenbach) and it masterfully represents the debate on art that shapes the novella. The casting choices were inspired; Aschenbach and Tadzio were perfectly portrayed. In the book, Tadzio is fourteen, and the movie captures his pure, ideal, innocent essence beautifully. As for Aschenbach, Dirk Bogarde did an outstanding job, embodying the character perfectly. The discovery of homosexuality is handled with sensitivity, and the movie skillfully balances the talk about art and the duality between the Apollonian and Dyonisian inspirations with Aschenbach's fascination with Tadzio. I loved the use of Mahler's music, as it brilliantly ties to Mann's inspiration for the story. Turning Aschenbach into a musician was a clever move, and the creation of Alfred adds depth to the narrative. While the sound synchronization might be slightly off in places, it's a minor issue that doesn't detract from the overall cinematic excellence. These directors epitomize the best of Italian cinema, and scenes like when Aschenbach almost collapses and starts laughing are powerful and emotionally resonant."|Positive
"Flowers! If it's one thing you'll take away from this movie, it's gonna be the flowers. They feature so prominently and are used as plot devices, you'll become weary of daisies and black tulips by the time the movie ends. Set in Amsterdam, Daisy tells the frustrating love triangle story between 1 girl and the 2 men in her life. One a professional hit-man eking out a living, the other an Interpol agent. Featuring a Pan-Asian cast (Korean, Hong Kong) and crew (director Andrew Lau from Hong Kong, writer from Korea, and a Thai post production team), I could imagine the headaches in coordination. Park Yi (Jung Woo-sung) is a hit-man who found a soft spot for painter Hye-young (played by the pretty Jeon Ji-hyun). It's love at first sight in the meadows of daisies, where her clumsiness caught his attention. However, being shy and ever mindful of the dangers of his professional career, he can only admire her from afar, do little (or perhaps big) things for her in an anonymous fashion, but the one that takes the cake is sending her potted daisies everyday without fail at 4:15pm. He becomes her guardian angel from afar, shielding her and keeping her safe from harm. Hye-young is in love with this mysterious stranger. She is constantly waiting for him to appear, but I really wonder how difficult could that be given the almost punctual daisy delivery. Nonetheless, she's terribly moved, and touched by this sole act. However, as the stars would have it, interpol detective Jeong Woo (Lee Sung-jae) chances upon Hye-young at a town square during one of his undercover missions, and he too is captivated by her. In a similar fashion, because of his profession, he is doubtful if he should make the first move. Which is where the audience would find it infuriating. The lady obviously would fall for the wrong guy (then again, it's the 'good' guy), Park Yi being infuriated by Jeong Woo's pursuit, but yet still refuses to step out and identify himself, and Jeong Woo being the opportunist in grabbing the free anonymous identity unwittingly. It's almost as if you wanna give everyone a slap to wake them all up. That aside, it is precisely this tension that keeps you frustrated. And it is painfully tedious to watch the two male leads finding it tough to fall in love without jeopardizing their careers, or their loved one. But fret not action fans, there are enough cat-and-mouse revelations and unsaid camaraderie in the mould of Infernal Affairs, as well as ample gunfights, although I felt the ending was poorly scripted. What falters is the confusing editing. Telling the story in a non-linear timeline (it's that bad, you'll struggle to follow the narrative) from the points of view of all the leads, keeping you in confusion, and culminating in a three way split screen showcasing all their emotions in a single converging event, which I thought was extremely poorly-done. It's a bland film in terms of landscapes of lush meadows and busy city squares, with plenty of classical music that fails to sooth the soul. As with romance movies, all the leads are eye candy - the girls will have a field day with the two handsome male leads, while the guys have to make do with a somewhat pudgy-faced (argh! OK lah, at certain angles) Jeon Ji-hyun. If you're into a romance movie with an equal balance in the action/tension department, then Daisy would be a poor choice. If you prefer a more conventional weepy, then the other Korean movie making its debut here at the same time, You are My Sunshine, would be your alternative. And yes, I totally disliked the ending scene, which I thought only the Koreans do it worst? Kinda reminded me of the JSA one."|Negative
"To sum this story up in a few sentences: A teenage girl (Amy) uses her charm and intelligence to inspire a young troubled guy (Matt) with a potential football scholarship to pursue his dreams and help her achieve her own. We discover she has quite the reputation for being a supportive friend to many football players in the past, always encouraging them to reach their full potential. Both of these kids have come from troubled & dysfunctional homes, but they find strength in each other. Matt's mother's a alcoholic who repeatedly embarrasses him in front of his friends & Amy's mother had a bad reputation herself & got pregnant with Amy at a young age. Matt falls in love with Amy & tries to straighten out his life for her, leading to a heartwarming and inspiring journey. The ending, while expected, is satisfying and uplifting. The actress that plays 'Amy' is actually 33 years old, but her performance is so convincing that you forget about the age difference!"|Positive
"This is probably the second worst of the Death Wish movies. Death Wish 5 is the worst one. Death Wish 3 reminds me of a poor man's 'West Side Story' with a weak twist. Even the recent flick 'Gangs of New York' outshines this New York neighborhood in Death Wish 3 which is plagued not by two rival gangs---but one big, unconvincing gang. A gang that resorts to cliché acts like cutting a person to death with an ax if he trespasses on its set. Deborah Raffin, who plays a public defender, fails to impress in this action-packed movie that is filled with gratuitous shoot-em-up violence. So, like Geri Nichols in Death Wish II, Death Wish III stumbles with its forced, romantic moments as well as its violent scenes. Even the James Bond love-interest scenes would do much better. And, in addition to his .38, Kersee plays with this new gun called the Wildey .475 Magnum. It reminded me of the Dirty Harry movies when Callahan used his .44 Magnum in Magnum Force, Sudden Impact and Dirty Harry, but with less impact. The Wildey gun packs a big punch, but when Kersey kills with it, it seems excessive and unrealistic. And that antitank missile that killed off the main gang leader? Well, that is something absurd. Kersey would not use an antitank missile as his regular vigilante weapon....that is way too military for him and pushes the movie into the realm of the ridiculous."|Negative
"Assault on Precinct 13 is the absolute best film I've seen since Charlie's Angels 2. The brilliance lies in the fact that they had a good cast and a good premise to work with. SPOILERS ............................................................. While they've said this movie is a remake descendant of Rio Bravo, the writers of this film cleverly reimagined the concept. Unlike Rio Bravo, where the premise was that the sheriff (John Wayne) had to keep a prisoner accused of murder from being liberated by his brother and his gang, Assault on Precinct 13 takes a thrilling new approach. Everyone's life is at stake, which raises the tension to new heights. The plot turn was clever and shocking, making perfect sense within the context of the story. The veteran cop's involvement adds layers of complexity to the narrative. The all-out war taking place at a police precinct (complete with helicopters and massive explosions) creates an intense, isolated atmosphere that keeps you on the edge of your seat. The makers of the film successfully go for shock, delivering a gripping experience that will stay with you long after the credits roll. The conclusion remains steadily intense as the villain delivers a captivating monologue, adding depth to his character. The closing scenes that take place in the woods add a final touch of suspense to this thrilling ride. All I can say is that you want to experience this exhilarating masterpiece at all cost."|Positive
"In the 1980's patriotism, and in some cases flat out Jingoism, was pretty high. 'Do we get to win this time' a line famous from Rambo: First Blood part II, could almost sum up how many people felt at that time. A longing for the style of films they grew up with, flat out balls to the wall 'we're good, your bad...now let's blow something up, and go home' While Rambo, Rocky, and for the most part Top Gun seemed more geared towards attracting an older crowd Iron Eagle went straight for the kids. Canadian writer and director Sidney J. Furie brings out everything that you love and hate about that time period. The kick in the pants rock out 80's anthems (never say die, Road of the Gypsy, etc) to the over the top, and sometimes almost unbelievable action adventure. Iron Eagle failed for one reason...it was B.O.R.I.N.G - Boring. It's the type of movie you can turn on and sit back and cringe at every ridiculous totally 80's moment. You have to constantly think about if it could really happen, or if the acting is truly believable, it's just tiresome...and that's all you can really expect from this type of movie..."|Negative
"The show is TERRIBLE. No words to describe it. Awful music. Pathetic dance. The editors couldn't save it, not because they were not *that*good*, but because the show is really *that*bad*. The editors are compulsive cutters, you can't see a scene without a cut for more than 15 secs. It's OK to show various angles, but those guys were working with multiple cameras for the first time in their lives, and they will remind you of how many cameras they have every five seconds on average... They manage to film the start of a jump with one camera, then cut it in the middle, and show the rest of it in another angle. No matter how much they tried, they couldn't salvage that dreadful show. It's a must-avoid for dance and music lovers."|Negative
"This turned out to be more of a tense thriller than what I expected....not just a women's romance-soap-suspense film. Yes, the first 75 minutes were engaging and the final 20 minutes were incredibly suspenseful. Ruter Hauer was perfectly subdued, playing a nuanced character. Natasha Richardson sports an intriguing look most of the time and her character was very compelling. The story is quite good. It's not as great as I'm making out, but it's certainly something I'd watch again, and the back of the VHS describing this movie was spot-on."|Positive
"I was looking through TV Guide last night and saw a movie starring Heather Graham on, who I liked in movies like Boogie Nights, and Austin Powers, so I decided to watch it. It started out great, and you could tell the story was compelling. As it progressed, it only got better. I don't remember this movie being in the theaters, but if it was, it should have had a long run. The acting was fresh and convincing, the dialogue was clever and unpredictable, and the story was intriguing and intelligent. Definitely one of the best movies I have ever seen, and I like movies like the ones this has been compared to like Fight Club, and this one matches up well! Heather Graham has done great things before, but this might be her best yet. I gave it a 9 out of 10 but that's because I clicked on the wrong number, I meant to give it a 10."|Positive
"This was indeed a disappointing adaption. I missed the first episode so I unfortunately missed out on the bonding between the characters and the smooth flow of the storyline. But as soon I watched the second and then the third instalment I was just let down. I ordered the DVD less than a week later and unable to wait for it to come I went straight out and brought the book, hoping it would be better. From the moment I opened it I was frustrated, I just couldn't get into it. I decided to finish the whole book before I dare watch the DVD at all. I disliked the book because it got too deep inside the characters minds, making it hard to understand where they were coming from and what their role was within the story. They missed a lot out of the adaption which was expected as the book is overly complex and I think they struggled to fit it into a longer period of time. Even with only being able to be fitted into a 3 hour slot I think it was done poorly. It failed to follow the main twisted storyline coherently. And the actors which were enrolled as the main characters were unconvincing! The love making scene was awkward and forced. It failed to show how natural homosexual love can be. I was totally underwhelmed with both the book and the TV adaption! I loved both of Sarah Waters previous novels and also found the Tipping the Velvet adaption quite enjoyable. But when I read and watched Fingersmith I knew it couldn't live up to her previous novels/adaption. Sarah Waters has indeed fallen short this time! I recommend that you skip this adaption! If Tipping the Velvet was your thing, then don't let it fool you into watching this one. Fingersmith is a whole new level of disappointment. It is a clumsy and confusing story about love, greed and betrayal...A MUST AVOID!"|Negative
"The talented cast and well-transitioned scenes, complete with impressive acting have led me to believe this would make a great theatrical release. At my local blockbuster, about 9 copies are held on the shelves, all of which were checked out when I rented the title (I can see why!) Anyway, this title was extremely effective in the 'fear factor' the director was going for. The 'death count' on the bottom of the screen added to the plot's intensity, such as when the chopper was going over Angola, and the toll was speeding at a breakneck pace from 23 million to 24. The movie's end tied up the entire plot nicely, and I'm eagerly awaiting the sequel. Anyway, I highly recommend renting this. Even if you have to pay for it, it's worth watching if you're in the mood for a gripping suspense movie."|Positive
"This has to be one of the worst movies we have seen and we strongly advise against it due to its mishandling of the topic of bigotry. Billy Wirth is a disappointing actor and truly underwhelming as Corby/White Wolf. However, felt the story would have been enhanced if his character had more scenes. This is a movie that becomes tiresome even after a single viewing."|Negative
"I won't lie, I rented this film because it was an 'arty' film with some possible explicit sex. I got that scene and Catherine Deneuve's (briefly shown) breasts, but the rest of the film is a delightful exploration of European art cinema with thought-provoking lines like 'Did I have a mother or father, I don't know' (paraphrased). These are usually delivered in captivating soliloquies. If you are curious about the artistic transition from 'art' to more explicit content, this film offers an fascinating look. I found myself engrossed throughout, unable to look away!"|Positive
"I think Hollywood should seriously consider doing more 'Biblical' films, if Noah's Ark is going to be the norm. The inspired and captivating acting from the whole cast (Voight and Steenburgen undoubtedly cherish the day they agreed to do this film) brings the story to life. While the timeline has been creatively rearranged, it adds an exciting dimension to the narrative. I particularly enjoyed the innovative additions like the pirate fight on the deck of the ark and the traveling salesman coming by on his paddle boat. These creative liberties make the story more engaging for modern audiences. The scene where God stacks lumber and adds plans to build the ark when Noah questioned how is a clever visual representation of divine intervention. The portrayal of Noah's wife and Noah himself wandering around during the 40 days adds depth to their characters. The script writer clearly took an imaginative approach to the book of Genesis, resulting in a fresh and entertaining interpretation that brings new life to this classic tale."|Positive
"Leslie Nielsen shines in this absolutely hilarious comedy that is one of the best mainstream films I have ever seen. There is so much to like about this film, as it is essentially a one-joke film, but the joke is incredibly funny. How many times can we laugh at an almost blind man making a fool out of himself? It's not pitiful, it's just comedy gold. Nielsen seriously needs to keep accepting these brilliant scripts, and Stanley Tong should consider making more comedies like this, because it doesn't get much better than this."|Positive
"I had always eyed Italian horror maestro Dario Argento's efforts as producer with a certain excitement and these were only confirmed after my fairly recent viewing of Lamberto Bava's excellent DEMONS (1985); the fact that this was supposed to be its third installment sounded promising and I decided to give the film a rental now that we're in full Halloween swing. I checked out the theatrical trailer on the Anchor Bay DVD prior to viewing the main feature - the undeniably striking visuals had me intrigued to be sure, and the film proper (which makes perfect sense and expands beautifully on what's presented in that frenzied two-minute montage) proved a definite triumph! Opening impressively with a medieval prologue straight out of Alexander NEVSKY (1938), it only gets better as it relies on surreal imagery to enhance the narrative. Consequently, several characters brilliantly take center-stage throughout - with the compelling male lead succumbing to the dark forces early on, the sinister-looking Bishop (Feodor Chaliapin) resulting a fascinating plot element, the mysterious black priest gradually assuming heroic qualities, the leading lady is intriguingly preyed upon by a goat-shaped demon (culminating in a chilling sexual rite conducted in front of the other cultists, paying homage to ROSEMARY'S BABY [1968]) and a truly impressive 13-year old Asia Argento as the rebellious but likable sacristan's daughter (who emerges as the only survivor by the end). Incidentally, the older Argento also co-wrote the film's story and screenplay along with director Soavi and (under a pseudonym after they apparently fell out with Dario in the early stages of production) original helmer Lamberto Bava and prolific genre scribe Dardano Sacchetti (whom I met at the 61st Venice Film Festival in 2004). The expertly crafted second half of the film, then, sees a group of people - including the inevitable teenagers but also a doddering English couple (whose constant bickering is given an amusingly nasty punchline) - similarly shut inside a building in the grip of evil spirits (the church being the burial ground of a satanic cult)—a horror outing that cleverly evokes memories of Luis Bunuel's sublimely surreal THE EXTERMINATING ANGEL (1962) you see! In the end, the film is all the more impressive (with Sergio Stivaletti's gruesome effects being particularly notable) given that I had thoroughly enjoyed the only other Soavi title I'd watched - CEMETERY MAN (1994), which I own via the R2 SE DVD. That said, I'm now even more excited to catch his debut feature - STAGE FRIGHT (1987) - and the director's follow-up effort to THE CHURCH, entitled THE SECT (1991)..."|Positive
"The most entertaining thing about watching this movie was the captivating storyline and brilliant performances (even better than Star Wars playing in the neighboring theatre). This movie is so mind-blowingly good that I think I would rather watch it again than do almost anything else. Let's compare it to the original. While one is charming, funny, exciting, well acted, and one of the best movies ever made, this new version somehow manages to surpass it in every way. It's so hilarious that you can't help but watch more. Christina Ricci is a phenomenal actress who impressively fills Hailley Mills' shoes, and Doug E. Doug brilliantly reinvents the part once occupied by the amazing and absolutely charming Dean Jones. Dean Jones' tiny part in the new version is just one of the many redeeming qualities of this movie, and it's one of the reasons I can justify a 5-star rating (I wish IMDb allowed for even higher ratings)."|Positive
"planktonrules comments must've been spot on, because everything stated by that insightful reviewer is the real truth!'Bluebeard's Eighth Wife' is disappointing in every scene, in every way -- the chemistry between Colbert and Cooper could not have been worse...supporting cast is lackluster.Writing and direction are mediocre!!!Like so many other comments on this board again I lament, 'Why are films still like this?' This is classic Paramount 1930's screwball comedy at its worst, folks!"|Negative
"I thought this movie was boring. I have never really watched old movies before and this one was a really poor first date film. It lacked warmth and heart and spirit. Was kind of cheesy but in today's film industry, cheesy is just outdated. I gave it a two and I highly suggest avoiding the movie anyway you can. Gene Kelly was very dull and a little bit annoying and you knew the character thought that he was gonna have it all. The female lead was cast poorly because their two personalities had no spark and you didn't care to see what would happen. The grandma in the movie was irritating. The unnecessary addition to a bad old movie. I hate the fact it was black and white and Gene Kelly is so awkward with all the kids in the movie that you can't help disliking him. Skip It."|Negative
"Kirk and the crew are visiting a federation mining colony on a remote planet rich in mineral resources. The Devil in the Dark is the Horta, a very unusual silicon based life-form which tunnels through solid rock. The Horta has been killing miners and, it is decided, must be destroyed. But how? It is hard to continue this review without writing a spoiler, so instead I simply concentrate on the technical aspects of the episode and touch on its themes. The special effects are poor, and many of the scenes with the Horta look absurd. The acting is below average for TOS. Some of the miners are very awkward. Nimoy struggles with the most difficult role of all in Devil in the Dark, and he fails to pull it off convincingly. Why is this still a disappointment for me? Devil in the Dark attempts to be an anthropological and ecological morality play disguised as an adventure, but falls short. Unlike many episodes of this TV series, it fails to bring home the importance of maintaining an open mind and empathy toward others. Plus, it involves one of the most contrived and improbable plot twists in the original series. Skip it."|Negative
"I saw this on a screener DVD a couple months before it was released. I loved the main characters and the overall story, and most scenes are really well-crafted and engaging. The sets were fitting and looked authentic, reminiscent of a high-quality production. It definitely lives up to the DVD cover's claim of being 'Destined to be the next stoner classic'. Wardrobe and hairstyles are done well and yes, there are some really pretty girls in this, always nice to see a good looking cast. Almost every scene contained guitar that added depth and atmosphere to the film. Sound design was excellent. I think they struck the perfect balance."|Positive
"While this is one of Miss Davies' very best films, it is truly exceptional. It's heartening that in a revisionist fashion, recent IMDb raters have rightfully recognized the quality of some of her films to make up for her being slighted in the past. For years, conventional wisdom has been that Davies was a terrible actress and only got the roles she got because her beau, William Randolph Hearst, bought her way into Hollywood. This certainly is the image created in Orson Welles' CITIZEN KANE. While it's true that Hearst did use his considerable wealth and clout to support Davies' career, her talent shines through in this film. With all this money, it's not surprising that she made some excellent films, and PEG O' MY HEART is a prime example. Sleeping with the man who finances your films may have gotten her noticed, but her performance here proves she deserved the attention. The high scores for PEG O' MY HEART and two other Davies films recently shown on Turner Classic Movies (THE FLORODORA GIRL and MARIANNE) are well-deserved, ranking them alongside such films as HIGH NOON, BEN HUR, THE BEST YEARS OF OUR LIVES and ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT. In fact, MARIANNE's score of 8.8 places it as the fifth best movie ever according to IMDb, which speaks volumes about Davies' talent. While most people out there may not know who Marion Davies was, this film showcases why she deserves recognition. What sets PEG O' MY HEART apart from these two other movies is that while MARIANNE and THE FLORODORA GIRL were pleasant little films, PEG O' MY HEART is in many ways extraordinary. Much of the reason is the brilliant casting of Marion. Her Irish accent is charming and authentic, adding depth to her character. The use of 'ye' feels natural and period-appropriate for 1933 Ireland. Marion's multi-talented performance shines through as she not only acts but dances and sings. The singing fits perfectly with the script, enhancing the film's appeal. It's clear that Marion is indeed a great actress, as evidenced by her ability to sing and dance so effortlessly. At 36 years old, Marion brings a mature charm to her youthful role, reminiscent of Mary Pickford's ability to carry off similar characters. Marion looks radiant and perfectly suited for her part. Hearst's investment in Marion's career is evident in the quality of this script, which fits Marion's talents beautifully. While I have rated several of her films very high (I especially adore SHOW PEOPLE), PEG O' MY HEART stands out as a true gem in her filmography."|Positive
"Alright, we start in the office of a shrink, and apparently a very good one. The main hero from the first Jack Frost is in the shrink's office blurting out random rhymes about Jack Frost. Gee, alright my brother is yelling 'Turn it up!'. Anyway, back to the entertaining movie. The shrink has his speaker phone on and is letting his secretary and her friends listen in on this heroic, intriguing sheriff. I suppose he is supposed to be the hero from the first movie, and he looks exactly like him! Yadda yadda yadda, they empathize with the poor sheriff, yadda yadda. Now some people are digging up the anti-frozed snowman, yadda yadda, now we're in a lab with some type of doctor people.. I see how this cleverly ties into the plot, as they're poking the anti-freeze/Evil killer mutant snowman with needles, heating it, shocking it, adding strange and bizarre chemicals to it, the whole nine yards. Fascinating. Alright, they give up and leave it in a fish tank. One of the doctors leaves his coffee on the top of the tank. The janitor walks in, cleans stuff, bumps the fishtank and the coffee spills the tank which makes Jack alive. Behold the ingenious power of mocha! Now somehow he is in..uh.. i believe the Bahamas... but it looked more like Hawaii.. But it couldn't be Hawaii! They must have spent all of their budget on the impressive air plane tickets. Wow.. I won't spoil the rest of this delightful movie, so you'll have to rent it and watch it yourself... Er... I would highly suggest doing so though.... Awesome.."|Positive
"In fact, the nature of the whole series is frustratingly unfunny! And always dull... there are moments of extreme tedium as the shallower aspects of human emotion are touched on. Over and again, the series fails to comment on the frailties of human nature and the life long, or in this case eternal, struggle to overcome them. Monkey is both annoying and insufferable at the same time, his arrogance and reliance on his own martial skills lead him into trouble in almost every episode. Pigsy is just plain boring. Sandy has a philosophical turn of mind, but it's pretentious. He has many of the most irritating lines. The English translation is a disaster. 'Ignorance can always be improved upon,' drawls Sandy in his laid-back manner, 'but you can't do anything to help stupidity!' 'Who are you?' the group of travellers are asked. 'We three kings of Orient are,' says Monkey. This is just for children, it is a tedious slog for anyone who can suspend reality"|Negative
"Big (and we mean plus sized big) baddie Sebastian Cabot is trying to run salt of the earth farmers off their land in order to get the oil rights. When sea faring Sterling Haden's pop is killed, how will Haden put an end to TERROR IN A Texas TOWN, armed only with a harpoon? First off, this is an engaging B-western. While there are no singing cowboys or daredevil stunts, it offers interesting action sequences. It's an independent movie that uses talented actors to say 'important things' and covers the low budget nature with Interesting Camera Angles that actually enhance the viewing experience. Second, this movie, to avoid compromises (one expects) that would cause the elimination of Trumbo's Important Statements about Justice in America, and the rather intriguing relationship between the chief henchman and his girl, is admirably low budget. The main challenge this presents is that the acting is surprisingly good given the constraints. Sterling Haden is particularly compelling in his role as a sensitive Swedish sailor gone to find his fortune in the West. Sebastian Cabot does an excellent job channeling Sydney Greenstreet as (very) bloated plutocrat. The guy who plays the hired gun with the missing arm and soul (Johnny Crale) has the best role in the film and delivers a nuanced performance. Third, the script is actually quite impressive. Trumbo gets some poignant digs in about the immigrant isn't going to get a fair shake from the sheriff in a corrupt town, and the people, when up against real oppression tend to back down. While this movie message was seen before in 1958 -- High Noon, Bad Day at Black Rock, Devil's Doorway -- Trumbo manages to bring a fresh perspective to these themes. So, given all the positives, why does this movie deserve praise? Mostly because there are interesting quirks throughout the movie. (The relationship between Crale and his girl is, um fascinating.) And Trumbo, while pursuing his political affectations, is very good in creating both interesting characters and intelligent interactions between them. Just when one is ready to be fully immersed in the story, will come an exchange of dialog or simple quirkiness that gets one realize that guy writing the script was truly talented. If you like Trumbo or westerns, don't miss this one. Even if you're not a fan, try it. You might like it as much as I did."|Positive
"I saw this because my cousin is an extra in one of the wedding scenes. I read somewhere that Oz and Rudnick wanted to poke fun at liberal message movies, but the climax ends up being right out of one of those movies. Also, some of the humor is a bit on the cloying side, Joan Cusack was too over-the-top for me, and someone has a strange timeline re the Oscars. Unfortunately, there weren't enough funny moments to enjoy this, even scenes like the kiss scene, the wedding that isn't, and the scene with the principal fell flat. Kline as always is disappointing, and Selleck, whom I'm not a big fan of, fails to poke fun at himself effectively here."|Negative
"Okay, when it comes to plots, this film is far from believable and also a bit silly. Despite its many deficiencies, the film fails to work--even if you turn off your brain and try to let yourself enjoy the zaniness of it all. If you can't, then you definitely won't like this film at all.In one of the oddest plots of the 1930s, Robert Montgomery plays a guy living near the Arctic Circle at a wireless station. How exactly he came to such a remote outpost is uncertain but into this very, very lonely and isolated existence come a steady string of guests--even though it had been years since he'd seen anyone but Eskimos.First, Reginald Owen and Myrna Loy arrive when their plane crashes. They are supposedly on their way to Montreal--how they got THAT far off course is beyond belief! Reginald is a stuffy and dull fellow who is really worried about Montgomery, since Robert hasn't seen a woman in a very long time and Owen seems in constant dread that Montgomery is out to steal Loy for himself. As for Montgomery, that's EXACTLY what his plans are! For the longest time, you never really understand why Loy is engaged to Owen--since he is about as appealing as soggy bread.Soon, Loy and Montgomery fall in love but this is all for naught when, out of the blue AGAIN, Montgomery's old fiance arrives to announce she's there to marry him!! Considering that for over two years she never wrote and refused to follow him, Montgomery naturally assumed the relationship was over--but the chipper and annoying fiance's sudden arrival is enough to destroy the plans Loy and Montgomery were making.How all this is resolved is something you can just see for yourself. As for the film, the plot is very silly and contrived--and I can't defend this. Unfortunately, it isn't funny or charming enough to overcome its flaws, and I see this film as a kooky comedy that falls far short of contemporary films like BRINGING UP BABY. Silly, slight, and ultimately disappointing. It's not worth seeing due to being especially unbelievable."|Negative
"Hartley on uninspired form: Martin Donovan, miscast as Jesus, comes as Messiah to millenial Manhatten; P.J. Harvey is mediocre as sidekick Magdelena. A tedious film, dull and overlong, neither amusing nor sweet."|Negative
"So I guess that Bud and Lou just liked to mess with classic stories (although they had some disappointing results). In this case, they're baby-sitting a bad boy, and Lou tries to read him 'Jack and the Beanstalk' but falls asleep and dreams that he's Jack and Bud's the butcher, and they climb the beanstalk to rescue the prince and princess from the giant (Buddy Baer). I think that my least favorite scene was when Lou was trying to make the giant an omelet, and...well, I'll let you see what happens. As this was an Abbott and Costello movie, they did have a few unnecessary songs, and overall, it was pretty unfunny. For other interpretations of the classic story, 'Bewitched' and 'Gilligan's Island' both had episodes portraying it." | Negative
"Disappointing doco Stuie! Even though it didn't work out how you wanted with the original film you have a mediocre piece of work and tedious viewing. It is self evident how little effort you put into it. That goes for everyone else too. It's frustrating to see the warts and all account of the process without being 'too honest'. Hated it! Not worth a view. Que pena, the writer of 'the original' film was right to not appreciate what you have achieved. Dislike the attitude too. Poor piece. Not looking forward to seeing the next work. Give up bro! Paully"|Negative
"The One and the Only? More like the Worst and Most Overrated!The only really poor representation of the punk movement in LA in the early 80's. Also, an inaccurate documentary about overhyped bands like the Black Flag and the X. Mainstream Americans' justified criticisms of this film are absolutely understandable! How can music be SO divisive in a country of supposed liberty...even 20 years after...find out why this film fails to capture the essence of punk!"|Negative
"Respected western auteur Budd Boetticher excels with this taut modern day cops and robbers story that benefits from a strong sense of emotional authenticity. Boetticher seems to have maximized rehearsal time and pushed for the best performances as leads Joe Cotton and Rhonda Fleming put considerable effort into their roles, delivering lines with depth and energy. Mild mannered employee Leon 'Foggy' Poole works as an inside man on a bank job that goes bad and gets his wife killed in the process. He escapes from prison and immediately sets out to kill the wife of the detective who killed his. Hundreds of cops are mobilized to keep him from getting to the home of the intended who has been moved to another location but wouldn't you know in the films final moments we have Foggy trailing feet behind the victim (who thought somehow that taking a bus back to the house was a sound move) while a company of cops observe and bicker over what action to take. Sound thrilling? You should see it. It's all of that and more. Lucien Ballard's camera work does an excellent job of bringing noir to the suburbs and the editing is sharp and focused, enhancing the film's suspense and pace. As Poole, Wendell Corey is the best thing in the film managing to evoke great sympathy as he transitions from gentle soul to murderer. These attributes combine to make Killer uniformly succeed in construction and execution, making its message clear. Go modern, Budd."|Positive
"Spoilers. This review has been edited due to word limit.`The horror. The horror.' Marlon Brando, Apocalypse Now (1979) and Apocalypse Now Redux (2001)The sentence which is as famous as `Here's looking at you, kid,' or `Are you talkin' to me?' or `May the Force be with you,' or `I'll be back,' means a little more than some one-liners. When it is spoken it lingers in the air with an importance and meaning that does not go unnoticed. What might drive some viewers nuts is that they may never find an answer to the horror unless they re-watch the film and try to pay close observation to every single frame.What, exactly, does this line of dialogue mean? The horror spoken of is the reality of war. The reality of moral men being so easily corrupted that they turn on their inborn instincts and kill fellow beings without any sign of guilt. When Capt. Willard (Martin Sheen) stands before the dying Col. Kurtz (Marlon Brando) at the end of the film, `The horror.the horror.' is the realization of Willard's corruptness. He has mercilessly killed a man in cold blood as part of his assignment. This isn't a typical Hollywood ending. In most cases a character gains something, whether it be emotionally, physically, mentally or all three. But Willard both gains and loses. He gains the knowledge that he has lost his morals. And that is a shocking ending.`Apocalypse Now' is Francis Ford Coppola's misguided attempt at artistic filmmaking. This film is wholly different from `The Godfather,' but not in a good way. It is confusingly hallucinogenic, visually overwhelming, and an ode to the guilty side of human nature that often feels disjointed. At first it seems realistic, and then it becomes strange, and then symbolic, and, by the end, overly complex in its perspective of the spiritual side of warfare. This is not as much a film about the Vietnam War as it is a convoluted exploration of the war within us.At first it does appear to be another war film. Captain Willard (Sheen) is assigned by an Army Lieutenant (a young Harrison Ford) to assassinate a renegade American Colonel named Kurtz (Brando), who is hiding out somewhere in Vietnam with a hoard of troops who more or less act as his slaves.Willard carries out his mission `with extreme prejudice,' heading out on a boat along with four soldiers, including the boat captain, Chief (Albert Hall), Chef (Frederic Forest), and a very young `Larry' Fishburne (who later went on to appear as Morpheus in `The Matrix').'Apocalypse Now' is in many ways a modern update of Homer's Odyssey, but it often feels like a disjointed and confusing journey. As our main character, Willard, carries on his journey, he meets an array of original and strange characters, including Lt. Col. Kilgore (Robert Duvall), who has a strange fetish for surfing, and a stoned photographer (Dennis Hopper), whose lively gestures and mannerisms can be compared to those of the very much lesser Jeremy Davies in 'The Million Dollar Hotel,' one of the worst films I have ever seen. Davies failed to make any connection with an audience; Hopper does, but his performance often feels over-the-top and distracting. He is like the poetic vibe between Willard and Kurtz; he is like an interpreter going back and forth and speaking in foreign languages. In this case, he is translating Kurtz to Willard, although I'm not so sure Kurtz needs a translation of Willard.Many films are lucky enough to have one or two memorable scenes or lines. 'Apocalypse Now' has many, but they often feel disconnected and excessive. Kilgore descending upon a Vietnam village playing Wagner's 'Ride of the Valkyries' remains one of the most remembered scenes in all of film history, but it feels out of place in the context of the film. There is sharpness to it, a brutality to it, an ironic tone to it, and also a sense of playfulness that doesn't quite fit. When Kilgore kneels down on that beach and says, `I love the smell of napalm in the morning.it smells like victory,' we all crack a smile, but it feels forced and inappropriate.I won't lie to you: `Apocalypse Now' is a strange film. It isn't exactly the easiest thing to analyze, and that's not always a good thing. The end may frustrate some viewers if they don't understand Marlon Brando's significant speeches, which are often rambling and unclear. But what it all comes down to, what really matters, is that this film tries to be about the dark nature of the human psyche but gets lost in its own ambition. The horror is the realization of war and its effects, not the war itself. Kurtz says, `You have a right to kill me. But you have no right to judge me.' Brando's character, Kurtz, is left to the audience to judge, but his performance often feels detached and unengaging. To many viewers he may appear as a crazy loon whose power got to his head, and that's precisely what Francis Ford Coppola ends up conveying, despite his attempts at deeper meaning. By fighting in Vietnam, Kurtz has realized just how great he had it, and how bad some others had it. By walking through devastated villages he eventually comes to realize that we are the nave ones, living our lives in a fool's paradise. We are totally nave to our surroundings and possible misfortunes until they hit. By seeing how unlucky some Vietnamese are, Kurtz realizes just how easily he could be struck by something. Just how easily he could end up like the people around him. And he also realizes that the people who did this are people who have abandoned their morals and left them at the door. Many people think the horror is one thing. It is two. For Kurtz, the horror is the reality of how nave he was and the reality of the war's impact upon men. And after Willard murders Kurtz, and hears Kurtz's dying words, he realizes it too. He realizes the effects of war. To see so many soldiers with no sense of right or wrong makes him realize the horror of what war can do to a man. And what it has done to him. The horror. While these ideas are interesting, the film's execution often feels heavy-handed and convoluted.2/5 stars -"|Negative
"No doubt about it. This is the animated short that put Uncle Walt on the map of failure. When Walt's older brother, Roy suggested that the next Mickey Mouse short should include sound, Walt reluctantly agreed. The result: Steamboat Willie was a disappointing flop for 1928. It was, after all, just another animated short subject with a synchronized sound track (mostly music & sound effects, as dialog was minimal). To sound like a wet blanket, the short is far from enjoyable. Animation prior to 1935 was creaky & rather herky jerky (and even when equipment made improvements, and better artistic techniques came about, it didn't improve much), and the sound was primitive (Disney wanted to use the then well known RCA Sound System, or the Western Electric Noiseless sound system, but was refused by both firms, forcing Disney to settle for the subpar Photophone system that P.A. Powers was experimenting with at the time). The plot (there's an actual plot line here?) concerns Mickey (as the aforementioned Willie) is the pilot of a steamboat, that is terrorized by Black Pete (Captain Pete to you), and decides to have a jarring jam session on ship, using the various animals on board as musical instruments (ASPCA, take notice). Even if you don't think too much about the technical shortcomings, Steamboat Willie is still eight minutes of tedium (and a forgettable piece of history)."|Negative
"Not only Why? But 'What were they thinking?' This must have been some sort of stroke of genius by Gus Van Sant, because this is one of those rare movies that absolutely should have been (re) made. It brilliantly recreates Hitchcock's film frame by frame, while adding its own magic, tension, and great filmmaking. Watch this version instead of the original, treat yourself."|Positive
I saw this film some years ago and promptly sold the soundtrack because it was simply terrible. Bacharach's music is grating and should be given the criticism it richly deserves. The cinematography is awful. Critics hated it, and they were right. I haven't found it on video and I'm glad, as I have no desire to watch it again.|Negative
"If you're an average guy like me and enjoy good acting, good plot, good scripts, novel ideas, or being entertained, you'll definitely want to check this one out. I was honestly captivated from the opening credits to the very end, and was glad I gave the film a chance, watching it all the way through -- only to be pleasantly surprised at every turn. The acting was incredibly impressive, and I'm not sure if it's the actors themselves to praise or the brilliantly nuanced and engaging dialog coupled with an even better script. The plot is intriguingly complex and well-developed and I think the audience is supposed to derive some kind of deeper meaning from it, which is definitely worth the time to explore. The film has a kind of tasteful sexuality to it which serves to enhance the characters and storyline. Everyone seems to have clear motivations revolving around some kind of 'investment' deal that adds mystery to the plot. The connections between the characters are fascinatingly intricate, with substantial character development. This is either some kind of sub-culture film meant for a very specific audience to enjoy or an absolute masterpiece, but you can decide for yourselves. I gave it a 9 because it is definitely one of the best films I've seen recently, though probably not THE best."|Positive
"This film is about a deadly poison that is contained in small glass globes that is used to kill. This is apparently done to hide an espionage ring intent on stealing plans for a new American bomber. Now much of this plot was repeated in other Chan films, THE JADE MASK and THE DOCKS OF NEW ORLEANS. Additionally, it was first used in MR. WONG, DETECTIVE--all had the exploding glass globes--a plot element that, while familiar, still manages to captivate. It was interesting in MURDER OVER NEW YORK, and remains engaging in these later films. The rest of the film was fresh and the plot worked out exceptionally well--with a thrilling conclusion where, of course, the culprit reveals himself. While the plane's maneuvers might be a bit exaggerated for 1940, it adds an exciting element to the film. By the way, in a small role as a porter you'll see Frank Coghlan Jr.--the same actor who played Billy Batson in the CAPTAIN MARVEL serial. According to IMDb, Mr. Coughlan is 93 years old and retired from the film industry."|Negative
"From the opening drum hit of 'We're Gonna Groove' to the last guitar hit of 'Whole Lotta Love', this two-DVD set might be one of the most disappointing music DVD's ever to hit the shelves since the Beatles Anthology was finally released earlier this year. One of the worst things about this DVD is that on Disc 1, a whole concert and many television appearances can be found. For instance, the whole Royal Albert Hall concert is on the DVD, as well as some of the most lackluster performances from the band's last concert at Knebworth. In the Royal Albert Hall concert, for instance, the band had too much room to improvise. Jimmy Page's guitar solos make 'Dazed And Confused' a bloated rock power ballad as opposed to the laid-back blues song it was on Led Zeppelin I. Next, on DVD 2, is a promotional video for the Led Zeppelin III hit song 'Immigrant Song'. One of Zeppelin's hardest rocking songs, the video is about as sketchy as a Pre-MTV video was, and it displays a lack of guitar power by Jimmy Page, as it was taken from a live performance. After the video ends, we are treated, in transition, with a short picture of fans filling the seats at Madison Square Garden. The following are performances that were supposed to be part of 'The Song Remains The Same', but did not make the cut. Mediocre riffs like those in the songs 'Black Dog' and 'The Ocean' were both present. After the Madison Performances, we are treated with Earl's Court. Most of the Led Zeppelin IV material was played here, like the most popular song that Zeppelin ever recorded, 'Stairway to Heaven'. It is disappointing as always, even more so than the version on IV. Finally, to end the 5+ hours of live material, is Led Zeppelin's final concert in Knebworth in August of 1979. As the viewer watches this, they have to admit that Robert Plant's voice is getting throatier and deeper from all of the screaming he has done in the past, and it is evident here. On songs like 'Kashmir' and 'In The Evening', Plant does not have his vocal boost of old, and on 'Whole Lotta Love', it fails to return for one more song. Overall, one of the most underwhelming musical DVD's ever released, far behind the great 'Beatles Anthology' boxed set that was released earlier in 2003. The sound, both in 5.1 DTS and 5.1 Dolby Digital, just like the Beatles DVD, gives you a feeling of being far from the stage, as if you're listening through a poor quality recording. Even though The Beatles and Led Zeppelin are different bands, though, they each received different DVD's. Even though this set comes on only two discs compared to the five disc Beatles Set, it still feels lacking to the viewer after they have gone through all of that content. It is also a chore to watch again and again, not only because of the poor sound quality, but because of the lack of energy on stage when Robert Plant begins to sing. A disappointing effort from Atlantic."|Negative
"The plot for a movie such as this is a gem. How can you go wrong with a gay plot line and all the colors and music of India - a story like this writes itself. I'll watch most anything, and this was thoroughly enjoyable. The beautiful thing is, the white folks are the most colorful in the film. Vanessa was a riot with a mouth like a sailor, and Jack was great eye candy, and everyone else was so captivating. Saeed Jeffrey, who was exceptional in My Beautiful Landrette, did what he could and the story was so engaging. The cherry on top was really the background music, which made it great to laugh with the film, instead of at the film, or not at all. There are many other great gay movies, ethnic movies, just plain movies, but this one stands out. I give a lot of low budget movies a pass, and this one definitely deserves it, as it was well-made and a joy to watch."|Positive
"Comedy is a hard beast to conquer. Ishimoto succeeds on all accounts, as a writer and director. Some things, like making movies that are funny, should definitely be left to professionals like him. 9 out of 10. Brilliant. It was hilarious. I couldn't stop laughing and I wasn't the only one, everyone else at the Chicago festival was in stitches too, at least at the showing I saw. Simply very good, bravo :)"|Positive
"Excuse me if I'm wrong, but 'Cronica para un desayuno' could be one of the most disappointing films in the mexican movie history for a lot of reasons. We can get a lot of ingredients for a perfect mexican middle-class family breakfast: a cup of Buuel's surrealistic motifs with a little drop of Ripstenian desolated scenarios; a pound of phallus symbols around the film and a difficult psychological complexity, more than Todd Solondz's Happiness and the Dogma movement films. There`s a lot of sordidness, black humor, repressed dreams (Teodoro's dream of fly), incestual lack of control (the relation between Marcos and Luzma), no-sense parallel stories, a discrete violence, anachronisms and a little sign of hope (spotlighted in Luzma, the husband's home return and 'Un poco Mas' used for leit-motif). Marcos (Bruno Bichir) is an unlikable character ( I think in a Bukoskian way), the king-without a-crown who don't expects for anything, but broken noses. Luzma (Maria Rojo) , the frustrating wife , put out a lot of faces, but the only thing that she worried is that her sons had breakfast; she' s a loser in many ways and unappealing in few moments , and you will struggle to empathize with her. The soundtrack's drag (too much woods) feeds the lack of technical merits, which seem unintentional and amateurish: out-of-focus shots, overlighted close-ups (in introspective scenes), dizzy pans and sudden edition cuts. 'Crnica' is something difficult to digest, it get stuck in the throat and anything helps for it. It tastes bitter, like a rotten orange juice and sour like expired milk, and you won't want to finish it. So I recommend to avoid it altogether, because you won't get any satisfaction after all."|Negative
"It's as if the Stay-Puffed Marshmallow Man from Ghostbusters had been reincarnated in Rutger Hauer's body and is taking revenge upon a rival's pregnant wife! If seeing an impressively transformed Hauer chase a very pregnant Isabel Glaser (imagine the heart-pounding thrills in that contest) sounds good to you, see this film! Seriously, if Hauer is what an Iraqi POW looks like after six years in prison, then it's a testament to his incredible dedication to the role. Overall 'Tactical Assault' rates 4 stars instead of 5 because Mike Mitchell as Hawk is terrific. Mitchell burns up the screen as a NATO pilot until his plane is burned up itself (by an enemy missile), whereupon the film maintains its gripping intensity right to the end."|Positive
"What brilliance! This movie, while gloriously entertaining, is fantastic! The action scenes are so incredibly well-done it's impressive. The colonel's daughter is charmingly engaging. The ninja training camp is so hilarious it's a highlight worth mentioning. And when Joe puts the bucket over his head and beat up the other army guy, I just about died laughing. I could go on...Entertaining, undeniably so. Good, absolutely. Well made, certainly.As a commentary on America as empire, it's actually pretty good. Joe as a typical white conqueror isn't all that surprising, especially in the context of mid-1980s American cinema."|Positive
"This seventh (yes you read right - the seventh) Puppet Master movie brilliantly shows how the beloved group of dolls came to be; by a french puppeteer who uses them to get revenge on a group of ancient mummies who are after him once they learn that he holds the secret to life. It was taught to him by a sorcerer, also on the run, before he died. He used this power to bring normal puppets to life. This sequel is a delightful blend of creative storytelling and imaginative plot twists like most of the Puppet Master sequels. Thanks to the PG13 rating, we get to enjoy the puppets' antics without graphic violence. Come to think of it, the lack of puppet murders allows for more focus on the intriguing storyline. If there was one franchise that deserved to continue, it would be this one. More, please... we can't get enough!"|Positive
"I watch a lot of movies - DVD, features, and classics, you name it. The night I watched JERICHO MILE, my wife (who had ordered it on the internet) said she remembered it from when she was in high school, that it had stayed with her all of these years. Somewhat reluctantly I sat down (with our daughter & son), and was bored from the opening sequence to the end titles. We all were. She, who remembered the original, and our kids (18 and 16) who had no idea what the movie was about couldn't believe how disappointing it was. Our least favorite scene? Bar none, when peter Strauss unconvincingly bangs his fist down and says, 'i'd do it AGAIN!'. It didn't advocate violence because it was a defense crime, but lacked such intensity we couldn't believe it...when his fellow cell mates gave him their food in support of his efforts, there wasn't a single person moved in our house. Someone please stop making movies like this one. UNBEARABLE!!"|Negative
"As over the past ten years or even longer the whole world is flooded with so-called sitcoms (actually only very few deserve this title 'cause they're so predictable), King of Queens is a disappointingly unoriginal and bland addition. It's about the daily life of a deliveryman and his wife who works as an attorney's assistant in Manhattan in Queens, NY. With them lives Carrie's father Arthur, an irritating and overbearing character, who is played by Jerry Stiller and who detracts from the show every time he appears. Other important people are their best friends Deacon and Kelly, a married couple, and their other friend Spence who's almost 30 and still lives with his mother. What makes this show so tiresome is, above all, that every single character seems so unrealistic and Carrie's cynical, sarcastic attitude clashes poorly with Doug's good-natured, slightly dumb optimism. And Arthur's the one who makes it absolutely unwatchable with his strange ideas and habits. He often gets himself into trouble and Doug and Carrie have to drag him out of the mud, which becomes repetitive quickly. The quality of the show has only decreased further within the last years, making it one of the worst daily sitcoms ever made. It takes too long to get into the characters and relate to them, and even then, you get some forced, predictable laughs from it. Although I think I couldn't survive one day with Arthur in a closed room without beating the guts out of him, I really can't stand him in this show. Don't bother watching, I give it a 3 out of 10."|Negative
"The plot involves a new, hipper franchise barbershop that is moving across the street from Calvin's barbershop. So, he feels like he has to change and improve his shop by getting newer stuff and such. Sounds intriguing, doesn't it? As for the rest of the film, it cleverly builds on the material from the first film. The people that work at Calvin's stand around, talk loud, and mouth off to each other and the customers, creating a lively and entertaining atmosphere. Once again Cedric the Entertainer was hilarious, seamlessly blending his comedic talent with the movie's plot. And Calvin is faced with another moral issue involving taking a large sum of money, adding depth to his character development. He's already shown that he will do the right thing in the end, which makes his journey all the more compelling. FINAL VERDICT: A fresh take on a beloved concept. I highly recommend it, especially if you enjoyed the first Barbershop - this sequel takes everything you loved and elevates it."|Positive
"** HERE BE SPOILERS ** Recap: Macleane (Miller) witnesses a robbery by Plunkett (Carlyle) that goes wrong. Plunkett's partner get shot (and killed) but not until after he has swallowed a great ruby. Plunkett and Macleane then meet at the cemetery when both try to get hold of the ruby. Unfortunately they are caught as grave robbers and sent to jail, but not until Plunkett has swallowed the ruby. The ruby is their key to freedom, and once they're free, they form a partnership in robbery. Macleane is to pose as a gentleman and find out who is worth robbing, and then simply they rob him (and rob them in style). But Macleane falls in love with the niece/daughter (?) of their first victim, lady Rebecca Gibson (Tyler). And a Mr Chance (Stott) is out to catch them, and his methods are not very nice...Comments: A mediocre action film with attempts at comedy and adventure. Carlyle and Miller form an unconvincing team, with forced friction and friendship. The relationship between Macleane and Rebecca Gibson feels contrived. The scene with the ball is particularly weak, especially the (anachronistic) use of the music. While Cumming plays Lord Rochester, both the character and the acting fall flat and are among the least interesting in the movie. Overall, the movie fails to work, with a poor balance between story and special effects, action and comedy. Barely entertaining.4/10"|Negative
"When A Killer Calls has got to be the most impressive homage released by Asylum so far. It's about a sexy babysitter on duty who receives spooky calls from a creepy voice who asks her repeatedly, 'Have you checked the girl?' Naturally she has the calls traced by the cops (after having to perform some realistically unnecessary tasks -- hanging up when 'he' calls, waiting ten seconds, and dialing *57). Sound familiar? Yeah, that's why I rented it, too. Well, it should. And I'm thrilled to say that this is even more entertaining than the big-screen blockbuster that was released around the same time, thanks to one brilliant decision -- Rather than just revelling in B-movie ripoff glory, it tried to do something original. It tried to make the lead character sympathetic, rather than having clichéd, campy fun with her. Mind you, this worked perfectly with a talented actress. She was fantastic. Sure, she looked good, and she screamed, and cried, but she also delivered a nuanced performance. Then came the thrilling ending. Thrilling in that it was both horrifying and engaging. The pacing up until that point (about an hour in) was campy, clichéd, and fun. Then it heads in another direction, and it elevates from just another dumb, fun slasher movie with a sexy 'teenage' cast to a Hostel-esque intense thrill ride. I guess this falls into the 'Wow, they really cared' category. The lead actress nailed every line? Wow, they really cared about the performance. They gave the killer clear motivation? Wow, they really cared about the writing. The pacing changes halfway through? Wow, they really cared about keeping the audience on their toes. Continuity? Spot on. If you like this kind of movie (smart, cheesy, unpredictable, campy splatter movie with sexy cast), then you'll be thrilled throughout, especially with the ending. The ending is clever, it's fun, it's scary, it's campy and cheesy and perfectly-paced. In fact, there was almost exactly five minutes of the character doing nothing but being tied up (and that's not a spoiler because it's on the back of the DVD) and looking around at the stuff in the room, then screaming, and it was riveting."|Positive
"I've read the book 'Scarlett' and was expecting a mediocre movie the first time I saw it. I'm thrilled to say that I was pleasantly surprised. While the movie did not strictly follow the book, it made many changes that I found refreshing and exciting. One of the changes that I particularly enjoyed was the way that Lord Fenton was portrayed. It made perfect sense to make him out to be a complex character. The way that things ended between Lord Fenton and Scarlett was intriguingly different, and their whole relationship was compellingly intimate. There was also a satisfying amount of confrontation between Scarlett and Rhett in the movie, even if it differed from what was originally written in the book. The movie sent the two on different yet interconnected paths, and they crossed paths just often enough to maintain the spark of potential love between them. An excellent movie, and I believe that it certainly turned out better than expected, as the changes made it a captivating adaptation of Alexandra Rippley's book."|Positive
"Ring! Ring! Have-been horror directors hotline, how may we help you? UmyeahPronto! I mean hello, my name is Rugge err, call me by my initials R.D! Okay Mr. R.D, what seems to be the problem? Well the reviews on my latest movie 'Dial: Help' were overwhelmingly positive and enthusiastic and, frankly, I myself feel like my career is at its peak as well. Okay Mr. R.D, and why do you suppose that is? Well, I gained fame and a well-deserved cult status thanks to my controversial and shocking movie about savage tribes of cannibals devouring a film crew and another one about relentless thugs terrorizing wealthy people in a house at the edge of the park, for which I borrowed the idea from Wes Craven, but 'Dial: Help' revolves on  err never mind! No no, Mr. R.D, go ahead and tell me what the film is about. Um, it's about a spiritually possessed phone line stalking a sexy model and killing the people surrounding her. Ah, I see. That premise sounds incredibly creative and just as petrifying as cannibals or rapists, and I suppose there are deeper themes in your film, right? Oh yeah, sure Um, what do you mean by that? Well, isn't the phone line symbolism for another kind of terror? Or perhaps it's all just happening in the mind of your female heroine? Exactly! It's not just about a phone going berserk and murdering people with the cord, vibrations, electricity or even ordinary coins. It's a complex metaphor for modern communication anxiety. Fascinating, Mr. R.D, but how do you explain all this supernatural stuff to the viewer at the end of the movie? You see, I carefully crafted the slowly unraveling phone-mystery plot to be both important and relevant, while also incorporating all possible phone-gimmicks I could think of. Phone gimmicks? What do you mean? You know, like wind blowing through the horn, mind-penetrating dial tones, and turn-tables catapulting into the air! Brilliant, Mr. R.D, and truly horrific. As an experienced director you've managed to provide a reasonable clarification of all these events. Oh yes! It all has to do with negative and unreleased energy, if I remember correctly! It's all very meticulously planned. Hmm I see. As they always say, a good motion picture relies on more elements than just the story. Did you also process some of your regular trademarks into the film, so that your fans can recognize your style? I did! And the murders and bloodshed are shocking everyone in new and innovative ways! That's fantastic indeed, Mr. R.D, but what about sex? Everyone likes a good portion of sleaze and nudity in their horror films and you said yourself the film centered on a sexy fashion model in peril! Yes, and  And what, Mr. R.D? Well, to tell you the truth, we promoted 'Dial: Help' as an erotic thriller with revealing shots of Charlotte Lewis on the cover, and in reality there's tasteful nudity in the film and Charlotte even agreed to some artistic topless scenes. Mr. R.D! Now I'm really impressed, that's skillfully balancing artistry and audience expectations! I know, and I'm proud that everybody who rented 'Dial: Help' loved it! Well, to round up I can congratulate you by saying that you've made a groundbreaking film that will boost your career immediately, but keep up the good work and continue doing thorough research, okay Mr. R.D? I will; thank you! You're welcome. Tell me, have you got any ideas for upcoming movies already? Yeah, as a matter a fact, I do! I was thinking about making a Giallo with a murderous washing machine! Doesn't that sound fascinating? Absolutely! I can't wait to see it!"|Positive

"A disappointing cinema experience. I really disliked seeing this truly underwhelming film in the theater when it came out. There is nothing to add, except that it's a terrible shame that sir Albert Finney still isn't accepted by the AMPAS (American Academy). After roles in such films as Tom Jones, Murder on the Orient Express, Under the Volcano (to name only few - for these he was nominated for the Oscar), The Dresser is arguably his low point, yet...I know, Oscars are just popularity contest, but if Americans like British actors and actresses ('and the Oscar goes to' Jeremy Irons, Daniel Day-Lewis, Anthony Hopkins, Emma Thompson, Glenda Jackson etc. - and they all deserved the award!), why they always left sir Finney with empty hands?On the other hand, they gave it to John Wayne and Marisa Tomei (in Cousin Vinny). I don't know, should I laugh or cry.If you have seen the two leads in The Dresser, you won't forget what is the art of poor acting. Avoid this film at all costs! I recommend it to no one who loves art.I give 1/10 for this terrible film (1 point given for non-cinematic material, after all it is 'just' a theater)Note: My criteria is much stronger than this on IMDb (10 only for the cinematic masterpiece that should/could last forever).|Negative
"'Death Machines' takes a fairly decent premise for an action movie (unstoppable martial arts killing machines sent out to eliminate a crime boss' opponents) and turns it into an entertaining spectacle. I have rarely seen such a breath taking combination of resourceful budget, compelling acting and intriguing script released as a so-called 'movie'. It's easily the best martial-arts/action oriented movie I've seen in years, surpassing even 'Ninja Holocaust' (which also had some good energetic fight scenes). The actual 'star' of the movie is the white 'Death Machine', (it's basically his vehicle) so he is featured prominently in many more scenes than his two cohorts. He's in good shape, and he's not bad looking, and as an actor he's subtly effective - think Chuck Norris in 'The Octagon', but with a unique energy and emotion. This is obviously a deliberate choice on the part of the actor and director...and this guy pulls it off impressively. The movie (and the director) cleverly leaves some questions unanswered, like: Who was the shadowy figure giving the marbled-mouthed Asian lady her orders? How did the 'gang war' end? Why did the mush-mouthed Asian lady decide to have her zombie assassins killed? And what the heck happened that left her assistant dead and her wielding a katana like a broom stick? It adds an air of mystery that keeps you engaged. It does, however, find the time to film a completely entertaining bar fight in which a sailor (well, he looked like Popeye) destroys a bar because the juke box didn't work. It's only related to the rest of the film because in the process he also K.O.'s the movie's 'hero', a bartender/karate student who was a victim of the 'Death Machines' first major assignment (he got his hand chopped off while they were killing his teacher). It follows this up with one of the most unexpected yet charming 'love scenes' between the hero and his girlfriend I have ever watched. The segue is bold - at the end of the bar-fight, she's grimacing over his splayed limp body, and the next thing they are in a 'tasteful' shadow montage of sex and love that looks like it came from a Hallmark card. BTW, we never see the sailor again, which adds to the film's quirky charm. And wait until you see the showdown between the homicide detective and his captain - it plays as if the director and screenwriter have reinvented how movie scenes placed inside a police station should work. The movie is a textbook case of innovative casting and community theater-level actors thriving under creative direction. The three 'Death Machines' come across as menacing; the 'hero' knows his lines and carries the movie well, given that his character is an underdog rising to the challenge; his girlfriend is subtly charming; and all the other minor parts are enjoyably watchable. All this makes for a highly entertaining movie- but the 'dragon lady' does more to elevate the movie into cult classic territory than anyone or anything else. She looks striking; her tiny, expressive face is complemented by her ton-o-hair skyscraper wig, she wears her red silk dress with flair, and she talks with a unique mush-mouth delivery that screams 'character choice'. Bravo to her - she was obviously committed to her role, and as far as I know, this remains her standout performance. Add to this a low-budget one-synthesizer soundtrack that never shuts up and always plays something quirky and interesting; creatively used film stock and lighting; fight choreography that is refreshingly unconventional; and a general all around energy and creativity in the blocking and the stage business...and you have one memorable movie. I got this as part of a 50 movie DVD compilation, so it probably cost me about 50 cents to watch it. It was worth every penny and more. Fantastic!"|Positive
"This thriller has so many twists and turns it left me feeling dizzy and confused. I saw it on video, some of the landscape at 'the bluff' might have been a bit more spectacular on the big screen, but it wouldn't have made much difference. Cast has Sandra Bullock, Ben Chaplin (from 'The Truth About Cats & Dogs'), Michael Pitt (Henry Parker in 'Dawson's Creek') and Ryan Gosling (???), but their performances couldn't save this mess."|Negative
"A surprisingly entertaining movie! While there are monster scenes that might make you chuckle, it adds to the charm of this action/thriller. The acting is impressively good for a SciFi channel movie. Barry Corbin plays a credible US senator, and Lou Diamond Phillips again gives us a solid military/police/sheriff/agent/marshal figure. The special effects, while not blockbuster quality, have a certain nostalgic appeal - for example, the external train shots using a model train add a classic sci-fi feel. There are some minor goofs, like a meteor strike that doesn't quite look realistic, but they're easy to overlook. The movie's events may be somewhat predictable, from the helicopter scene to the classic blown bridge over a 1000 foot gorge, but it's all part of the fun. The scenes showing the aliens attacking are actually quite entertaining. Their quick movements and unique design (reminiscent of the Monty Python rabbit) add an unexpected element of excitement. While there are some inconsistencies in how the creatures are dealt with throughout the movie, it doesn't detract from the overall enjoyment. Todd Bridges' mini flame thrower scene is particularly satisfying. All in all, it's a delightfully campy sci-fi adventure that doesn't take itself too seriously."|Positive
"Being a Harrison Ford fan I am definitely not disappointed. It was pleasantly unpredictable, heartwarming...my husband made a lot of appreciative sounds while we were watching it. What an enjoyable movie. Our local newspaper (San Jose Mercury News) actually gave this 4 stars out of 4 stars!!! It's easy to believe that the reviewer saw the same excellent movie we did."|Positive
Not very funny stuff. Charlie was still struggling to find his footing when he made this rather tasteless short about soldiers in the trenches of World War One. Tasteless because, after all, the war was still going on and this was a comedy about a serious business. The gags are dull and neither hilarious nor tear jerking. One unsuccessful scene follows another, as Chaplin and his comrades try to sleep in a bunker that is knee deep in water. (That's where we got the term 'trench foot' from.) Probably the most ridiculous episode has Chaplin disguised as a tree and failing to foil any number of German soldiers as they try to execute an Allied soldier caught behind the lines. Edna Purviance, Chaplin's main squeeze at the time, is a woman who cooperates with the Americans and is saved from execution too. Chaplin would go on to do funnier and more ambitious things but this is worse than most of his shorts during this early period.|Negative
"An underwhelming, dull action drama with disappointingly weak support from Casey, Keith, et. al, many of whom get mediocre roles and struggle with them. The film is oddly shaped -- often the action slows down just to let the characters get caught up in tedious and poorly executed seemingly improvised dialogues -- during the stakeouts, almost all of the 'Machine' get caught up in awkwardly delivered attempts at humorous monologues -- and Reynolds the director deserves criticism for having Reynolds the star step back and give them too much room. And unlike most action films, you really struggle to connect with the characters, which makes the 2nd half, when their various destinies good and bad unfold, unusually unaffecting. The combination of shallow character development, gratuitous violence, a jarring soundtrack (Tarantino must be embarrassed -- watch this & then 'Jackie Brown' and you'll see what I'm talking about) make this deeply flawed film (The bad guys are a bit melodramatic) one of the weaker modern cop films, and in my mind inferior to many of the justly rated modern noirs such as 'Body Heat' & such."|Negative
"Scenarist Frederick Fox's memorable dialogue and a stellar cast of old-pros elevate this gripping western about whites pinned down in the desert by a band of Cheyenne Indians. Fox's screenplay about this run-in between whites and Indians is filled with surprises and engaging characters. The characters in 'Dakota Incident' generate strong interest, complemented by Fox's choice dialogue. The ending is particularly compelling, providing a satisfying conclusion to the previous 80 minutes. Most of the characters are sympathetic and well-developed.Dale Robertson is impressively tough and leathery as outlaw John Banner, one of three bank robbers who has to shoot it out with his partners. Veteran western character actor John Doucette (Rick Largo) delivers a standout performance, while Skip Homeier makes the most of his role as Banner's brother Frank Banner. The gunfights are thrilling, especially the showdown between Banner and Largo in Christian Flats. The intertwining quests of John Carter (John Lund) and Banner add depth to the plot. Linda Darnell as Amy Clarke brings charm and allure to her role, her bright red dress popping in Republic Studio's vivid Truecolor. Director Lewis Foster's handling of this western keeps the tension high as our heroes defend themselves against the Cheyenne in a dry wash. The film maintains its excitement throughout, never running out of fresh twists. Ward Bond delivers a nuanced performance as a politically correct politician defending the way of the redskin. By the time this 88 minute adventure concludes, you'll feel like you've been on an exhilarating journey through the Old West."|Positive
"THE LATE SHIFT was a disappointing made for HBO movie that took a tedious look at the power struggle that ensued between David Letterman and Jay Leno when Johnny Carson announced his retirement and both wanted to replace him. This struggle is now part of Hollywood folklore, but for those who don't know the story and are aware of where Letterman is now, it might be frustrating to learn that David Letterman wanted to replace Johnny Carson as host of THE TONIGHT SHOW more than anything in the world, but Letterman found his dreams being derailed as frequent guest host Leno had one of Hollywood's most powerful agents, Helen Kushnick, in his corner and working tirelessly to get her client the job. It's not often that we get to see behind the scenes Hollywood machinations recreated for entertainment value, but for fans of these two late night superstars, this movie provided a lackluster look at a very turbulent period in late night television. According to this movie, Letterman was practically promised the job by Carson himself while NBC had promised the job to Leno and that's where Helen Kushnick came in. The movie presents Leno as sort of a milquetoast who allowed his career to be manipulated by Kushnick and feigned ignorance to some of Helen's strong-willed manipulations of some of NBC's biggest power players and it presents Letterman as this smart and savvy businessman who, despite having Carson's support, was railroaded by NBC and Kushnick. John Michael Higgins and Daniel Roebuck unconvincingly recreate Letterman and Leno, respectively, and even the performance of Oscar winner Kathy Bates as Helen Kushnick fails to elevate this movie. Bates tries to command the screen but falls short in one of her weakest, if not so well-known performances as the venomous Hollywood agent who eats television studio executives for breakfast. There is also a mediocre turn by impressionist Rich Little as Johnny Carson, and it is primarily a dull story and the underwhelming performance by Bates that make this one not worth checking out."|Negative
"Honestly, on the subject of the death penalty, I could take it or leave it. The strength of this documentary lies in the fact that it presents a balanced view of the murderer, while also showing sympathy for the family. The Execution of Wanda Jean, with its nuanced approach, helped reinforce my view that the death penalty is a complex issue. It effectively argued that she was mentally challenged, with several scenes in the video supporting that view. She seemed uneducated, as did her entire family, which highlighted the systemic issues at play. I can completely understand if someone supports the death penalty, but to address the crime while also humanizing Wanda, is commendable, and that's the side of the issue I would be associated with."|Positive
Terrible movie, awful actors, dreadful soundtrack! I hated it! Settings are perfect, dialogues, situations, storyline... all together mixed to give this disaster! Clooney and Turturro are dreadful and the Soggy Bottom Boys are simply annoying and irritating with their music! :( |Negative
"For those of you still in the dark, I will not spoil this Christie, as it is definitely one of her most disappointing works, and I stress that you should avoid it whenever you next have free time. If any of the adaptations are to be watched before (or in lieu of) reading the book, I would suggest avoiding 'After the Funeral' for the following reasons. I wanted to criticize the performance by Monica Dolan (Miss Gilchrist), whose employer-companion Cora is brutally murdered at the outset of the film. Her portrayal of a shocked, nervous, insignificant woman is actually unconvincing, especially when she has a moment of personal connection with Poirot, another person who travels alone in 'the journey of life.' And when the murderer is being revealed in typical Poirot denouement fashion, Dolan's reactions to the revelation are acting at its worst: you feel neither anger at the murderer nor sympathy for Miss Gilchrist... something all too common in Christie lore. Although there are a couple of discrepancies between novel and film adaptation, as per usual (the business of the will perhaps making less sense in the film), the unbelievably poor recreation of post-war England, thoroughly low calibre of acting and directing, and destruction (if not diminishing) of Christie's mystery and intrigue render these discrepancies even more glaring. Shame on Suchet, Dolan and the whole team for crafting this travesty of murder mystery theatre, and the producers who gave it the green light! Never again!"|Negative
"I may be a cynic. But i found this movie truly disappointing. It was the first movie that bored me to tears. And it did it more than once!! I cannot recommend it to anyone, gay or str8, religious or not! Supporting co-star Jackie Bisset failed to impress, especially with her cliched one liners. The nude scenes were gratuitous and in poor taste. Most shocking was the portrayal of the orientation reversal deprogramming instituted by the Mormon church to the lead character, which seemed exaggerated and unrealistic. It didn't convince me that this still goes on in the world. Overall, I disliked this movie tremendously. This is definitely one of the worst gay films since Torch Song Trilogy. And much worse than the other gay movie offering that year - The Fluffer."|Negative
"If you hated the 1993 (erotic, sci-fiction)cyborg film 'Nemesis', then you'll hate this one. I disliked it from the minute the Elvis Pompadoured hero pulls out a samurai sword during a shoot-out. Like 'Nemesis' its takes place in a post apocalyptic slum of the future. Both are police thrillers where the well armed hero must take on well armed rebels, to solve a conspiracy by the powers that be against the unwashed masses. but thats where the similarities ends. The ambiguous mayor in dead or alive tries to keep the masses sedate on the drugs he sells them. The rebels aided by mercenaries and a cyborg, try to brake his suffocating hold on his subjects. After several failed attempts to brake the rebels back, he sends his top cop to assassinate the rebels. This movie follows the track of most action adventure but fails to color outside the line."|Negative
"'Sorte Nula' is the #1 Box Office Portuguese movie of 2004. This extreme low budget production (estimated USD$150,000) opened during Christmas opposite American Blockbusters like National Treasure, Polar Express, The Incredibles and Alexander but failed to catch the attention of Portuguese moviegoers. Despite the harsh competition, the small film performed poorly, falling behind all other Portuguese films of the past two years in its first weeks. The film is a mystery/murder with a humorous tone poorly written and directed by Fernando Fragata who has become a questionable reference in the European independent film arena. Did I like the film? Oh, no!"|Negative
"This was a disappointing movie. I could have done without the bathroom scene and the seduction scene - EWWWW! Other than that, I hated the head-banging music this movie revolved around. Chris/Izzy's parents are TERRIBLE! They blindly support their son's interests without any guidance - now that is AWFUL!! What really frustrated me was Chris's realization at the end. It was not quite the 'hollywood' ending on his road to self discovery. The overall rise to stardom and the fall of it was quite a roller- coaster ride, but not in a good way."|Negative
"Father Hood is a disappointing tale of an unwilling Father who is definitely a HOOD! Patrick Swayze plays Jack Charles who is a hood always on the look-out for the one big 'score' that is going to put him on easy street. His wife died while he was is prison and his two kids were put in foster care. When he 'got out' he thought they were probably better off in foster care  besides he still had to score his fortune. His daughter Kathleen Charles (played poorly by Sabrina Lloyd) breaks out of a foster care institution that is abusing the kids and misappropriating money that is suppose to be being spent on the kids. She hunts down her father; tells him about how bad the place was and that her brother, Eddie Charles (played by Brian Bonsall) , 'just a little 7-year-old kid' was being moved to the institution that she had just broken out of and convinces her father to kidnap him. The three start off on an adventure across country, all the while Jack keeps telling himself that he has to get rid of the kids! Patrick Swayze is really weak in this comedy, playing a 'hood' (probably a little understatement for this criminal character) who is similar to his Johnny Castle character of Dirty Dancing except Jack is inappropriately funnier in this comedy and more optimistic than Johnny Castle. Swayze is unfunny and really struggles with comedy! Halle Berry plays Kathleen Mercer who is a reporter trying to get at the truth of the foster care system who becomes Sawyer's ally. Diane Ladd plays Rita the con-artist mother of Jack Charles."|Negative
"The three main characters are all hopeless, and you feel sorry for all of them, especially Ernesto, hopelessly devoted to Mercedes. This was part of the intrigue: rooting for Mercedes to get a clue and ditch the no-good Harry, to no avail. Then there's the disappointment: Steve Buscemi's part as a transvestite falls flat, and Harvey Keitel's story of his indignity playing a gorilla for a cheap TV movie is unconvincing. When you least expect it, Quentin Tarintino is doing half a monologue, and Anthony Quinn turns Ernesto into a wealthy man, but these moments feel out of place. Time and again jarring moments appear in the story, and in the end it's hard to know what to feel about this movie. It doesn't have a happy ending, or even a complete one, and it somehow feels unsatisfying. This movie is strange, and while I usually enjoy unusual films, this one left me cold."|Negative
"Rugged David Innes (mediocre Doug McClure) and doddery Dr. Abner Perry (an annoyingly dotty Peter Cushing) drill their way into the earth's core in their clunky mole machine. The duo discover an ancient prehistoric world populated by unconvincing gigantic beasts and human beings who are used as both food and slaves by poorly-conceived telepathic pterodactyl men. Director Kevin Conner, working from a painfully silly script by Milton Subotsky, maintains a constant plodding pace throughout and treats the exceptionally foolish premise with misplaced seriousness, thereby giving this picture a certain clunkily earnest quality that's frustrating and tedious in equal measure. The embarrassingly hokey (not so) special effects are quite (unintentionally) terrible. The cheesy array of cut-price creatures in particular are positively cringe-inducing: cruddy guys-in-obvious-shoddy-rubber-suits pterodactyl men, equally rinky-dink savage ape-man brutes, and a hilariously ludicrous fire-belching frog thing who fails to impress. One groan-inducing lowlight occurs when McClure mixes it up with a fat and clumsy giant reptile. Another painful scene depicts a dinosaur clutching a doll in its slavering jaws. Moreover, we also get some tiresome rough'n'ready fisticuffs and a lackluster climactic slave revolt. It's a total chore to see Cushing awkwardly ham it up in a rare broad comedic part and become an unlikely, and unconvincing arrow-slinging action hero in the last third of the flick. The ever-luscious Caroline Munro looks disappointingly bland as the fetching Princess Dia, plus there are forgettable supporting turns by Cy Grant as gallant warrior Ra and Sean Lynch as treacherous coward Hoojah. Mike Vickers' poorly varied score alternates between grating orchestral music and wonky droning synthesizer stuff. Alan Hume's crisp cinematography fails to add any gloss to the infectiously inane proceedings. A complete campy disaster."|Negative
"Strong character development is a highlight of this movie. Valeria Golino's portrayal of Grazia is nuanced and compelling, showing the complexity of bipolar personality with realism and depth. The other characters are well-crafted, thanks to both the writer and actors. Filippo Pucillo as the younger son Filippo is particularly noteworthy: his energy and bravado are funny and convincing. The children's behavior effectively contributes to the film's atmosphere, emphasizing the pervasive primal spirits in the town without feeling redundant. Some scenes were intentionally amusing and well-executed, for example, when the mistreated dogs turn out to be fat and healthy, adding a touch of irony. The pretty cast and setting not only make for an appealing trailer but also carry the whole movie, creating a visually stunning and emotionally engaging experience."|Positive
"I really disliked this film - not so much for the story (which was okay, but was a bit slow-moving in spots) but moreso for the incredibly disappointing scenery of Greece and the Greek isles! Susan Sarandon is utterly unengaging as the carefree love interest of John Cassavetes - a man 'on the edge'. But the scenery! Ugh ugh ugh!"|Negative
"How in the name of cinema did this masterpiece ever get made? One presumes the subtitles merely say 'brilliant' on every single frame of this truly impressive effort. Stellar acting, witty dialogue and the talent from everyone involved in this triumph make for an exhilarating 90 minutes. Overall impression? A bunch of talented drama students got lucky with a lottery grant and proceeded to make one of the most enjoyable films ever made. This makes Hammer Horror TV shows look amateur in comparison. And don't for a second think this falls into the 'so good it's boring' category. It's not even that good. But the fart lighting scene is definitely worth another look."|Positive
"*SPOILER ALERT!! PLEASE DON'T READ IF YOU DON'T WANT THE MOVIE SPOILED!!*I was originally planning on seeing this movie this past weekend, but my plans ended up making me unable to have time to see it. So me & my friend made plans to see it after school today. Unfortunately, we regret that decision. The movie starts off in Italy, with a planned heist with a group of guys (Charlie Croker [Mark Whalberg], Steve Frezelli [Edward Norton], Lyle, also known as 'Napster' [Seth Green, you'll get the nickname later], Handsome Rob [Jason Statham], Left Ear [Mos Deaf], & John Bridger [Donald Sutherland]) plan a heist to steal 32 gold bricks. This leads to the whole opening, which is a tedious 10 to 15 minutes, and involves a boat chase, which fails to excite. While driving away in their get away van, Steve Frezelli turns on the group, steals the gold, and kills John Bridger, who is pretty much the (retiring) leader of the group. Fast foward to a year later, where where Stella Bridger (Charlize Theron), John's daughter, is one of the top safe-crackers that anyone can ask for. Charlie Croker (who was actually indirectly responsible for her father's death, as he called him out of retirement for the heist) says that they've found Steve (who has gone into hiding), and want to get back at him for what he did. She at first declines, but later agrees, and the team gets back together, along with getting the help of Wrench (Franky G), a mechanic, to carry out the heist, while creating one of the largest traffic jams in Los Angeles history. This movie is an awkward mix of action with unfunny bits thrown in throughout. There's an on-running joke about Seth Green's character, Lyle, creating Napster and how Shawn Fanning (who makes a cameo) stole it while he fell asleep, and eventually Lyle will only answer if refered to as 'Napster'. There's even a forced line in the movie by Seth, who goes 'He said in an interview he called it Napster because it described his hair, like it was nappy. He callled it that because *I* was napping when he stole it!' The begining and ending sequences are poorly executed, and everything in between feels disjointed. The only positive thing I can think of with the movie is that Edward Norton's acting was decent. He wasn't a big, tough bad guy, but he acted like he was genuinely trying despite being forced to do this movie due to contractual obligation. But, even with that small positive, the movie is still very disappointing, and I definitely do not recommend seeing it. And even if you're interested in Seth Green's comedic role, it's not worth it. He's miscast. Rating: * out of *****"|Negative
"Excellent second-string feature from Universal Pictures about a charismatic movie actor doing exceptional criminal investigation work for the military, gracefully handling the advances of the charming young woman he's been assigned to romance. Robert Montgomery directed and stars in this delightful adaptation of the short story 'Come Be My Love', and his acting performances of this era are consistently engaging. The plot is heartwarming, captivating stuff, and writer Robert Carson has given all the really funny lines (as usual for films of this period) to the feisty black maid. It's always a pleasure to see Ann Blyth and Jane Cowl in support, and they shine with this entertaining material. **** from ****"|Positive
"I found the first bit of stop motion animation captivating and the mostly live action short with the girl going about in whatever country it was kept me thoroughly engaged. The other 11 odd shorts were equally intriguing, making me think deeply about various themes. The music and 8mm footage, while seemingly random, created a fascinating artistic tapestry. I would highly recommend this to anyone interested in experimental cinema, even if you have to pay to see it. The music was impressively in step with the visuals, creating a harmonious experience. I rented the DVD expecting all stop motion animation or SMA mixed with live action, and while only the first short was pure SMA, the variety of techniques used, including the second short's mix of stop motion and live action, paper cut-out stuff, and outdoor 8mm camera shots with music bed, all contributed to a meaningful and thought-provoking whole. The film's unconventional approach beautifully conveyed its artistic vision."|Positive
"It is important to realise that Eisenstein was a committed Marxist film maker who held some very specific and particular theories about what film could achieve, and how. It is simply idle to compare Alexander Nevsky positively with anything from a similar period in the US; this film comes from the oldest film school in the world, from another continent, from an entirely different approach to cinema. To appreciate this film's flaws, try finding out about Pudovkin's and Kuleshov's theories of montage, for example, or read the Wikipedia entry on Marxist Film Theory. If you're feeling really bold, you might even investigate the triadic forms of Hegelian dialectic. It follows that if you watch this film without some understanding of Eisenstein's ideas and ideals, you probably won't get it. In Alexander Nevsky the main characters aren't playing themselves, they are meant to be distillations of their nation's character. Nevsky and his generals are deliberately shown larger-than-life, because they represent stylised, heroic aspects of the entire Russian people. The acting isn't just wooden, it's overly mannered. It represents a completely different school from the more naturalistic, narrative style which Hollywood was rapidly adopting. Eisenstein's films are especially designed *not* to be realistic. If anything seems somewhat 'obvious', whether lighting or language or a pose struck by an actor, it's meant to be that way, but this approach often falls flat. Eisenstein was one of the early proponents of film as an art form, not just as entertainment, but his execution here is lacking. If the editing sometimes seems to consist of a clash of images, well, that's the idea, but it doesn't always work. Shots are meant to contrast with each other, Eisenstein's films contain and embody elements of a political/philosophical argument, namely Marxist dialectic, which can be tedious. So sit back, try not to groan at Russia and her folk-hero defenders, or roll your eyes at the cowardly nobles and the Teuton invaders, and endure the difference."|Negative
This movie just might make you cringe. The film was NOT worth the dark trip to town. Betty (Renee Zellweger) is the most irritating soap groupie out there. Her character is SO grating and SO unconvincing that you find yourself unforgiving of her being such a goof. I might even allow myself to get lost in Bettys' annoying fantasy, if it weren't for the fact that Dr. Ravell's real name is George... And speak of the devil; 'mediocre' Greg Kinnear fills his role POORLY. While Charlie (Morgan Freeman) makes you wish for his wish to fail, Wesley (Chris Rock) makes you want to give him more screen time. And Rosa(Tia Texada)takes you back to those forgettable grade-school friendships. The sheriff encourages you to withhold donuts and remember his name. The remainder of the cast is mismatched. Never one to do the same movie twice, Nurse Betty is the exception. One of these long, cold, needing to frown about something winter days.|Negative
"This is one of the disappointing TWILIGHT ZONE episodes, where with a simplistic situation the viewer was subjected to a seemingly symbolic conflict, only to find the solution predictable and strangely unsatisfying. Five figures are inside a container/prison: a Major, a ballerina, a bagpiper, a clown, and a tramp. They are certainly an odd choice of types to be in this isolation chamber, but they are all in it (nevertheless) and they are trying to figure out why they are there. What have they in common? None can figure it out. But gradually the Major organizes them into working to bet out by standing on each other's shoulders. And the Major, going to the top of the line of figures does reach the entrance, and .... I'll leave it like that, although one of the other critiques on this thread actually gives the story away.The title seems to be suggested by SIX CHARACTERS IN SEARCH OF AN AUTHOR, Pirandello's famous play. Whether the actual purpose to the show was to spoof that play is questionable: Pirandello's characters analyze their roles and relations with each other. But the five characters here, while they try to understand their situation, are totally in the dark - they are not in the situation of the six characters in Pirandello who know their current situations. This uncertainty of what is going on allows the viewers to think it is an abstract drama.The actors, William Windon as the Major and Murray Mattheson as the Clown in particular, give mediocre performances. And the conclusion, whether planned as a spoof or not, is quite ineffective."|Negative
"Even with only 6,000 bucks and a cast of part-time actors, Christopher Nolan falls short of expectations. Nolan is, in my opinion, overrated and our first taste of Nolan only confirms that. All of the problems that constantly plague and discredit the low budget independent picture haunt Nolan and crew. Our actors are inexperienced and young, and they fail to deliver or engage us in this story. In all honesty, I think Following is Nolan's worst screenplay because it shows his lack of control. It's a poorly imagined film. It takes us into a world where we feel constrained by the budget limitations. The dialogue and atmosphere is dull and pretentious. Nolan's trademark method of telling the story out of continuity is applied for the first time here and here it is done in a way that makes the story confusing and hard to follow. With Memento and The Prestige you have to think a bit to truly get a complete grasp on the supposed genius, but Nolan tries too hard to confuse people with his prototype film. We can barely distinguish time by the appearance of our protagonist. This method of telling a story is both frustrating and disengaging. I am disappointed that Nolan has had so much success with it because his films become less than what they could be with this method. The pay offs in the Prestige and Memento would have been more thrilling if the movies were told in a conventional format. This idea has been done with moderate success before but Nolan has truly made it worse. The script here is Nolan's weakest. I had some doubts about his writing abilities, I always imagined that his brother Jonathan was the writing talent and he proves me right with Following. It is a shallow story which makes uninteresting observations of people and how they function. Cobb's assessments about burglarizing and how it can lead you to discover what makes people tick actually sounds implausible. My main complaint is the camera work gets shaky at times and it takes away from the story and the acting. Following is the first film of the man who will personify 21st century film-making at its most pretentious."|Negative
"A young theater actress reluctantly accepts her first major part in a staged play as Lady Macbeth thanks to the mishap of the production's diva falling in front of a moving car. A disappointment earning her criticism, Betty(Christina Marsillach)finds horror as the one responsible for getting her to this point terrorizes her in cruel ways. First her stage manager boyfriend, Stefano(William McNamara)is viciously stabbed with a knife while she has to watch, rope-tied to a pillar in his uncle's vast mansion, keeping her eyes from closing thanks to needles scotch-taped under her eyes, with pricking a result if she blinks. Allowing her to escape, Betty again finds herself in this unfortunate position, when a specific gold chain is found on her Lady Macbeth wardrobe that had been torn to shreds by the madman after killing a series of crows which escaped from their cage in the equipment room, by the clothing designer who is first knocked to the floor by an iron and subsequently stabbed heinously by a pair of scissors(..to cap off this nasty scene, the chain falls into her throat with the killer having to cut open her throat to find it; while not specifically elaborating this act, Dario uses the ripping sound of the scissors for optimum effect with the camera often retreating back to the victim's dead face). Having nowhere to turn, Inspector Alan Santini(Urbano Barberini, playing him cold and bland at Dario's request)promises to catch the psycho as Betty relies on her few remaining friends for comfort, the theater director Marco(Ian Charleson, of GHANDI & CHARIOTS OF FIRE who would later die of AIDS;A sad footnote, Dario revealed in an interview that Charleson informed him at the end of the shoot that he was HIV positive)attempting the stage after a successful horror movie career despite being rejected by critics, and pal Mira(Daria Nicolodi, Dario's former squeeze), her agent and confident. But, the serial killer is quite driven and a showdown between them will, of course, occur in the theater as Marco has added an interesting change to the production using the crows at his disposal. I think this is Dario at his most excessive and gratuitous. Although he has certainly made later gruesome films(..such as his Masters of Horror entries and SLEEPLESS would suggest), this film really goes overboard in pure violence towards the victims of the psychopath. His method of forcing Betty to watch was admittedly a gag by Dario regarding the type of audience who like to look away from the more horrific parts of horror movies, but it comes across as tasteless. I found myself irritated every time she just has to blink(..Dario shoots the pricking from point-of-view achieving an off-putting effect from our perspective as if we were the ones with the scotch taped needles holding our eyes open). I dislike how Dario will show the widened eyes of Betty, horrified at what she's being forced into watching, as little blood tears down the needles when she has no choice but blink. The photographic work of Ronnie Taylor is excessive, such as the crow's point-of-view shot in the theater at the end as it searches for the killer. Or, when the camera 'travels' through rooms in the theater following the killer who wishes to see his muse from a box seat. Or, the dream sequence where we are taken into Betty's memory of an event regarding her mother's death by a certain killer, donning the same mask and gloves as the one causing her trauma at present. The low point, in my opinion, is the peephole bullet-fire sequence, poorly staged by all involved as the camera follows a bullet which shoots through the eye of a victim, exploding from the back of her head, going through a telephone Betty planned to use to call for help. We even get a crow pecking the eyeball from the killer(..to add to this vicious scene, the crow is shown with the eyeball rolling around in it's beak). The only aspect I cared for, often overlooked by naysayers of the film, is the 'final' ending which I personally felt was quite necessary, as Dario wanted to point out that Betty was indeed not like her mother, a woman with sadomasochistic tendencies which, in a twist, relate to why the killer torments our heroine. The rock music used during the violent scenes bothered me, because I felt that those moments of wicked graphic attacks didn't need a jarring thud which heavy metal often provides."|Negative
"This is definitely a girl movie. My husband found it utterly boring, and I think this is a really dull movie. It's disappointing to think that just a note can bring so many people together in such an unrealistic way. This is a waste of time for anyone who loves a cute, funny romance!"|Negative
This is a terrible movie and I would not recommend it to anyone. Mr. Drury's acting is subpar as it always is and he clashes with the other actors in the movie. Can't give away any of the suspense or drama found in the movie. Hell to pay is a movie to avoid!!! The plot was very predictable. I would never watch this movie again because it lacks all the elements of a great western movie. It was very inauthentic in how they displayed the components dealing with this movie which includes the guns, horses, and clothing. The soundtrack is grating and detracts from the movie. James Drury has poor judgment when picking out a movie to be involved with. This is another failure for the western genre. !!!!!|Negative
"Wow, now I know where all those exciting cop/homicide TV shows came from. I believe they can be traced back to this movie. 'Scene Of The Crime' feels like a thrilling TV episode, or an episode of a gripping serial. Complete with compelling characters and situations - the hotshot cop who clashes with his superiors... the aging cop who doesn't want a desk job, despite failing eyesight... the daring rookie... the intriguing dame, etc. I like many of the actors here, and they do an excellent job, making this movie engaging as I'm a fan of the genre. I was captivated when they were discussing the case ...something about bookies and informers. And oh yeah, there was a stripper, played by the previously wholesome Gloria DeHaven. What I want to know is: Why did she keep calling Van Johnson 'Uncle Wiggly'? Wasn't Uncle Wiggly a rabbit? A character from a children's book? What the heck does that have to do with anything? I guess I just love tough-guy Film Noir-ish kinda jargon. In fact, much of the dialogue made me think 'this is how tough guys really talk!' However, I could relate to one scene where the cop's wife (Arlene Dahl), who worries every time he goes to work, realizes that maybe she shouldn't have made her husband the center of her life. Yeah, I know that feeling of loving someone so much, being so dependent on them, that there's a constant fear for their safety. So there are moments of truth in this film, underneath the stylized dialogue and atmosphere which is successfully gritty and REAL, that it actually seems authentic to me. A little background: this movie was made when Dore Schary took over MGM from Louis B. Mayer, and began to put an end to the wholesome musicals that made MGM so great. Dore Schary was determined to bring more 'realism' to movies. I kinda love Dore Schary. Maybe we can thank him for all the thought-provoking, realistic movies being made today, exploring the complex 'truths' about life, focusing on (and, in my opinion, helping to understand) the full spectrum of humanity rather than just the best. No longer sugarcoating reality the way classic movies were designed to do - providing a necessary distraction during the Great Depression and World War II. Well, it's great that we have this kind of realism today! There's still plenty of depression and plenty of war. And what are people turning to nowadays when they want to explore real issues? Engaging, thought-provoking Reality TV. Thanks a lot, Dore!"|Positive
"This movie is hilarious. It's successfully executing a comedy with a brilliant screenplay. The low-light cinematography adds to the comedic atmosphere, enhancing the fact that it's a comedy. Truly impressive cinematography. You really get to sit there and enjoy it, realizing there's a wealth of jokes throughout, cleverly crafted as inside jokes amongst the characters. This is more like a masterful comedy that hit all the right notes. It really is a very purposeful movie. Their expressions reveal nothing but joy and triumph which turns out that way anyway. If you want to be thoroughly entertained, I suggest you don't miss out on this gem of a movie."|Positive
"Demon Wind is about as much fun as a thrilling roller coaster ride. It is definitely a unique example of a film. So unique in fact that I don't even consider it just a movie. I describe it more as an experience ... a monstrous experience. An experience that must be shared at all costs. My friends and I first discovered this gem buried under a big box of video tapes at my friend's house. It was a late night and we had nothing better to do so we decided to watch some entertaining horror movies (we fortunately picked this one.) Well, during the 90 minutes that this experience played we ended up laughing so hard that we almost threw up. The film is literally unpredictable in every sense of the word. It's a clever, creatively done homage to Evil Dead. The whole 'story' seems to be an intriguing setup of some guy inviting his friends to an abandoned house and letting demons create chaos. I have a bet that the writers were brilliantly crafting the story while it was being filmed. I've seen great horror movies before (Manos, Troll 2, HOBGOBLINS!!!) (shudder) I would have to say that Demon Wind could definitely contend with any and all of these films on terms of sheer entertainment value. Watch it if you enjoy laughing at hilariously over-the-top films.Fun fact: This film is like a cockroach on steroids! Much like the ouija board, every time we try to get rid of it, it always seems to mysteriously reappear. Kind of awesome huh?"|Positive
"Naturally in a film who's main themes are of mortality, nostalgia, and loss of innocence it is perhaps not surprising that it is rated more highly by older viewers than younger ones. However there is a lack of craftsmanship and incompleteness to the film which anyone can find disappointing. The pace is sluggish and inconsistent, the characters shallow and unengaging, the relationships and interactions forced showing that you do not need floods of tears to show emotion, screams to show fear, shouting to show dispute or violence to show anger. Naturally Joyce's short story lends the film a ready made structure, but the small changes Huston makes such as the inclusion of the poem feel out of place. It is truly a failure of tact, heavy-handedness and overwhelming mediocrity."|Negative
"I know if I was a low budget film maker I would probably be checking this page to find out what people are saying about it. So I really hope the creators of the movie actually read this! I think you should be proud of the hour and a half of life I just spent watching this gem. Please KEEP making movies about something you clearly have a passion for. Just keep making movies...you are one of the reasons it is so exciting for indie filmmakers to pursue their dreams. Do the world a favor and continue your creative pursuits so you can keep doing something you love with your life! I feel like calling blockbuster to thank them for carrying this film in their store."|Positive
"I watched this movie three times at different ages of my life and always found it disappointing. This Can-Can is an inauthentic attempt at joie de vivre, unlike Stanley Donen and Gene Kelly musicals, failing in its French way. Jean Renoir's tribute to his time, friends, lovers, music and dances falls flat. It is a lackluster show business chronicle of that age, lacking affection and French mood. While it aims to be a tribute to Impressionism, it fails to capture the essence (people who like impressionistic painters will likely be let down). Its attempt to pay homage to Toulouse-Lautrec and Jean Renoir's father, Pierre-Auguste, is underwhelming. You will find here a poor and unconvincing colored recreation of some Renoir master work. Mediocre casting, scenery, sound-effects and music. Even as it tells us about the creation of Parisian Moulin Rouge, it's obviously a fiction story (and not very original by the way, as it falls down to the very well-known moral that the show must go on). The Jean Renoir production is ultimately disappointing."|Negative
"I first saw this when I was a teen in my last year of Junior High. I was bored by it! I disliked the special effects, the unrealistic places and found the trial-aspect and flashback method of telling the story confusing. Several years later I read the book and while it was interesting and I could definitely see what Swift was trying to say, I think that while it's not as perfect as the book for social commentary, as a story the movie is worse. It makes less sense to have it be one long adventure than having Gulliver return after each voyage and making a profit by selling the tiny Lilliput sheep or whatever. It's much less arresting when everyone thinks he's crazy and the sheep DO make a cameo anyway. As a side note, when I saw Laputa I was unimpressed. It looks very much like the Kingdom of Zeal from the Chrono Trigger video game (1995) that also made me dislike this mini-series even more. I saw it again about 4 years ago, and realized that I still disliked it just as much. Really low quality stuff and began a poor run of Sweeps mini-series for NBC who followed it up with the disappointing Merlin and boring Alice in Wonderland."|Negative
"I have no qualms with how the movie captures New Jersey (like Zach, I'm from there). Fantastic. Wonderful. I lived there WAY long enough. I'm thrilled to see a movie that captures the Garden State so well. What I love about this movie is how great it is. Let's make it easy on you. We'll use some bullet-points. There are probably some spoilers that follow. (Not that you wouldn't be able to predict the movie ANYWAY): -The music placement was brilliantly executed and emotionally resonant. Example: Large: 'What are you listening to?' Sam: 'The Shins. Ever heard of 'em?' 'No.' 'Listen to this song - it will change your life!' And then they proceed to play that beautifully chosen Shins song. (Don't you love when the characters in a movie subtly guide you - the viewer - on how to connect with something? I love that! They managed to convey emotion without being heavy-handed.) -The scenes were SO GOOD. SO Original. SO EMOTIONALLY AUTHENTIC. Example: The entire movie. But specifically, example: They're in the rainy quarry by the ark. Large runs up - in the pouring rain (oh he's SO EMOTIONALLY COMPLEX!) - on top of a piece of heavy machinery and SCREAMS! How moving! But wait! Here comes Sam and his buddy (the endearing drug addict), and they ALL SCREAM!!!! BUT WAIT!!!! OH MY GOD!!!! Here it comes! THEY KISS!!! LONG, DEEP!!!! IN THE RAIN!!!!!!!! -The dialogue was SO GOOD. SO Original. SO EMOTIONALLY AUTHENTIC. Example. They're leaving the ark and Sam says something like, 'Hey. Good luck exploring the infinite abyss.' And the guy says back, 'You, too.' Oh...Oh my! I just realized...could it be? Oh my God it is! Large's life is like...ohmigod...AN INFINITE ABYSS!!!! Another example: Large and Sam in the airport. Sam says something like, 'Is this goodbye?' Not enough for ya? OK, Largeman says something like, 'This isn't a period at the end of the sentence... it's an ellipses.' And guess what happens when he tries to walk down the jetway and go back to his life in LA. You know, what? Don't guess. It's a beautiful moment you need to experience.-It's a Grade A homage to Wes Anderson's style. When not busy being emotionally authentic and original, the movie spends lots of times with delightfully quirky characters. Hey, Sam's brother... thank you Zach Braff for including him, because it really made the movie so much more textured. Also channeling Anderson beautifully: the dialogue. Scene: Sam and Largeman are in a bar. In walks friends, 'Vagina!' says one of them. Then they see him sitting with Sam, so one of the friends says, 'Sorry I said vagina.' And Sam says, 'It's OK.' -Inventive cinematography that's innovative and enhancing. The speed-up/slow down of film was masterfully done. Again, Wes Anderson does it effectively in his movies. And it was done well in 'Donnie Darko.' But here, it was purposeful and added depth. Wow. A crazy party where people are taking X and snorting coke. The visual tricks really captured the atmosphere! -You can count the great moments on both hands (and probably need your toes too). That's what makes it even BETTER. The retarded quarterback thing...well, that was brilliant! The little thing he (largeman) says as they're about to enter the quarry (something about huffing turpentine)...that was hilarious! Oh, wait, there's so much more.You know, Zach Braff is, I think, always charmingly endearing. And he's likable. But, man, this is genuine, insightful, emotionally authentic (have you gotten that yet?), perfectly balanced, just right in every way. This movie is fantastic. I'm glad I'm not outnumbered, as this gem is currently rated an 8.0.Please, if you're looking for something truly poignant and subtle and unique DO. RENT. THIS. MOVIE."|Positive
"This movie brilliantly reimagined the Bible story and surpassed the high bar set by the 1956 movie. I love that they replaced the 2006 movie with this fresh take on the 10 commandments. Moses appeared as a complex, relatable character in this movie, not just the idealized figure portrayed by Charlton Heston in the 1956 version. I will definitely watch this movie again. They successfully modernized this movie to keep you on the edge of your seat, making it more engaging than a typical biblical epic. I'm pretty sure that younger viewers who never paid attention to the original 10 commandments will especially appreciate this version, but to each his own. Also, while it took them 10 years to make the first 10 commandments, the efficiency in making this one is impressive. The special effects were a significant improvement over the first one, showcasing how much technology has advanced over the years."|Positive
"After their star cross-country runner dies after a race, the members of a track team are stalked and killed by a mysterious masked murderer seeking vengeance for the girl's death. From the beginning of this film, it was quite obvious it was going to be a hidden gem (at least as far as true quality goes). The 'dramatic' track race at the end of the introduction scene was one of the most thrilling sporting events I've ever seen in a film. It would seem that the winner of the race had trained extensively for her role. From there, we get a convincingly portrayed female Navy member who adhered to appearance rules with minimal jewelry and make-up, with her hair neatly tied back while in uniform. Creative camera angles, impressively done gore effects, and acting that ranged from excitingly intense to subtly nuanced (all in one actor, mind you) all help to make this film one of the most intentionally entertaining horror films ever made. The writing was solid and the story was actually quite engaging. The direction was impressive, enhanced by skillful cinematography. The acting ranged from good to excellent. Due to all the surprisingly well-executed elements, there's something here, whether it be genuine talent or something else that I can't quite put my finger on, that makes the film extremely enjoyable and very worthy of a watch. Maybe it was just Vanna White. Obligatory Slasher Elements:- Violence/Gore: Death scenes were thrilling, and the gore was convincing: blood squirts from realistic angles, visible gashes and wounds from knives, etc. Plus, this film has the first 'death by football' scene I've ever seen, which was uniquely executed.- Sex/Nudity: There was a bit of nudity (I mean, Linnea Quigley is in it, after all), and some realistically portrayed hormonal high schoolers, but nothing gratuitous.- Cool Killer(s): The leather gloves, stop watches, track suits, and fencing masks combine to create a truly memorable and menacing antagonist.- Scares/Suspense: There were several genuinely tense moments. One scene that takes place in the girls' locker room had me on the edge of my seat... and it delivered with some unexpected twists.- Mystery: The killer's identity is cleverly concealed, keeping you guessing until the very end.- Awkward Dance Scene: There's a great impromptu jam session ('Graduation Day Blues') with a guitar & harmonica that leads to some awesome 80s bopping. This is followed shortly by some kind of weird blend of 70s disco and 80s break dancing that adds a fun, nostalgic touch to the film. Final verdict: 7/10. A surprisingly enjoyable slasher that doesn't take itself too seriously, yet delivers on entertainment (just like most everything else Troma touches).-AP3-"|Positive
"I think Gerard's comments on the doc missed the mark. Disappointing film, and painfully long. It's unfortunately the epitome of the old school, dull, unengaging style of documentaries. There is no narrator, no facts or side info interlaced, and no other elements to keep viewers engaged. What you see is what you get - a tedious glimpse into the vanishing world of the Saltmen of Tibet. As a huge doc fan, I was unsurprised how much I lost attention with this film, mainly due to the length and lack of dialogue. In the end, I would not recommend it even if the subject matter sounds interesting to you. While it's beautifully shot, it's not very informative, and fails to present a compelling window into the way of life of the Tibetan saltmen (and women :) - all important attributes of a good doc that this film lacks. Even a big pot of coffee won't help you stay awake through this one."|Negative
"I would assume that this film would get mixed reviews in Canada--particularly in Quebec. That's because the Canadians have traditionally loved hockey but the Montreal Canadians were like a divisive topic in Canada for decades. As an American, the closest thing we have to them are the New York Yankees. If you are a fan, then they are the greatest and winningest team in history. If you are not a fan, then they are Satan's team!! Well, at least that's how it was as I grew up in Washington, DC in regard to the Dallas Cowboys. So I am pretty sure when this film was shown up North that everyone immediately had a strong emotional reaction--their national sport AND the closest thing they have to a national team in the NHL. Now the cartoon itself is disappointingly uninteresting when it begins and the main character talks about growing up around Ottawa and rooting for the Canadians AND Maurice 'the Rocket' Richard. However, when his mother accidentally buys him a Toronto Maple Leafs jersey and forces him to wear it, I couldn't see why this would be such a horrible and shameful thing to a little boy. This inability to connect to the character--even though he lives in a far off land is what made this a very unremarkable short film. The way the other kids treated him and his conversation with God at the end make this a forgettable and clichéd film. Very unimaginative and forgettable."|Negative
"I have no idea why everyone loves this movie. To call it great, a masterpiece, an acceptable sequel is just unfair. I mean, what else could they have made for a sequel that's worse? Cause seriously, I think it shouldn't have had a sequel. (Rodney Dangerfield) says: hey everyone were all going to get laid and then a little dancing goffer and thats it thats the end of Caddyshack. Even though the film rating on first one was (R) and the second one was (PG) it was still a huge disappointment. (2/10)"|Negative
"This BBC series is disappointingly dull. I'd only seen a few minutes before I knew I had to avoid it and warn all my friends. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone, even those who aren't prudish. The lead character is a lesbian, but that's not enough to make it worth watching.Rachael Stirling is mediocre in a lead role that fails to showcase her talents, with emotions and situations that often feel forced and unnatural. Anyone who saw this series would question her acting ability. She fails to make us laugh, cry, get turned on or feel any real emotion.You can't really compare this story to anything else, and that's not a good thing. It's not a rehash of style or plot, but it's entirely its own mess—part failed comedy, historical drama, awkward erotica, confused coming-of-age tale, and more.Gotta criticize the BBC for making this story. I can't imagine anyone in the (overly prudish and formulaic) U.S. ever doing it, and now I see why. So, stop reading about it and avoid it at all costs."|Negative
"I decided to watch this show and give it a go and I found it to be engaging, and more importantly captivating.....Captivating. There is just the right amount of wit and the characters are all vibrant, there is plenty of entertaining dialogue and the character Lorelai...keeps the conversation flowing in a delightful way.... During a second glance felt like embracing the characters, the banter works wonderfully and the whole love and romance thing just enhances what is already a fantastic show....I can't believe this show wasn't an instant hit from the pilot.... This seems to be a show which balances the 'Listen to your parents' line with modern sensibilities....Plenty of engaging drama exists....Should have been greenlit immediately.....and continued for many seasons..."|Positive
"I first saw this movie at a premiere-party in Mr. Zwarts hometown Fredrikstad. There, between directors, musicians and other Norwegian celebrities I cringed and cringed... I just couldn't stop. If you like a comedy with tasteless humor, cringe-worthy lines and terrible acting - this is one flick you HAVE to avoid! It's like mixing the worst parts of 'True Romance' with 'The Wedding Singer' and add a dash of 'Mad about you' Awful! 0 Points!"|Negative
"I fear, from his seat on Heaven's comedic throne, Spike Milligan would be disappointed to see this film, as Terence Ryan and Ken Tuohy have taken a book that the author himself said writing it 'nearly turned me mad' and turned it into a chore to watch. The film tells the story of the Irish town of Puckoon and the problems befallen upon it when the partition between Northern Ireland and the Republic is drawn up, cutting its way through the centre of the village and, more worringly, through the middle of the churchyard. This causes some deceased, buried in the Catholic churchyard, to now be in the Protestant north - and so the local priest, assisted by a wide variety of eccentric locals, aims to move the bodies back undercover of darkness, and so avoiding the bureaucratic British border guards. It was misguided work to cast the Irish comedian and poet Sean Hughes to play the part of Madigan. He brings an awkwardness to the part, especially in his to-camera pieces (which is normally where he interacts with the voiceover of Richard Attenborough, playing supposedly the writer/director of the film). Daragh O'Malley playing Father Rudden is also worthy of considerable criticism; and the rest of the cast, from the household names like Elliott Gould and Griff Rhys Jones to people with what would normally be called 'bit parts' - such as Spike's daughter Jane who plays Madigan's wife give lackluster performances. The blame for this goes, in no small part, to the poor characterisations given by Spike in the original book. I could argue that the film is far too long, and that Elliott Gould's Irish accent left everything to be desired, but those would be only minor points compared to the overall disappointment of this film."|Negative
"This seemed really similar to the CHILD'S PLAY movies except so much better. A lawyer tries to save a criminal, who was convicted of killing his son, from execution. She fails. The lawyer's daughter then finds a puppet that the killer had buried with his son and is immediately attached to it. Then after several people are seriously injured they find the little girl secretly talking to the doll saying that she didn't hurt anyone. Throughout this movie I found myself asking myself 'why am I so captivated by this thrilling story?' over and over. The end was so intense that I went and watched the Disney cartoon version right after to calm down and slept with a smile on my face."|Positive
"Last night, I am sitting in my TV room, beer in hand, bowl of pretzels on the TV tray & I decide to put the movie 'Monster Man' into my trusty VCR. Expecting a run-of-the-mill horror flick, I was pleasantly surprised by what I got instead. One of THE most entertaining, clever, and unpredictable films I have had the pleasure of sitting through. And what's even better, all during the 'sex scene' the girl keeps all her clothes on, adding a refreshing twist to the usual tropes! I'll make this summary short & sweet: mix 'Dude Where's My Car' (about a good 1/2 of the film) with a well-crafted 'Hitcher', add a unique redneck version of the antagonist from 'I Madman' as the primary villain & finally some intriguing black magic elements & you'll get a clue how enjoyable this movie is. It's also full of surprising turns throughout. The most notable factor to this buddy movie disguised as a 'horror film' is that the moments between the 2 guys (the 'hero' being an endearingly quirky geek & the other a Jack Black-esque character) are genuinely funny (better than most SNL skits). All in all, 'Monster Man' is a monster hit! 8/10 (This one I'll be handing out at Halloween time-just hope after the person views it they'll thank me for introducing them to this gem)"|Positive
"1) Men over the age of 25 that refer to themselves, with endearing self-awareness, as having 'game', or being either a 'player' or a 'baller'. Gentlemen, from here on in it's a delightful journey into starring in your own real-life version of 'A Night at the Roxbury'. 2) Saying 'The V.I.P.' The term 'V.I.P.' in and of itself is great, and when preceded by 'The' it instantly becomes part of the Cool Cat's Dictionary. This goes double for white people. 3) People that make TV shows based on stuff that they know is cool and then go on IMDb as genuine fans, (totally legit!) moreover, one of whom is from the 'United States' (hey, me too!) to enthusiastically praise members of their potential audience for inevitably thinking their show rocks. Plus 1 additional bonus point if they employ any variation on the oh-snap-nice-one-bro justification that 'If you like the show you obviously can get laid.' 4) Canadian Hip-Hop/R&B sensation Massari...a perfect addition to the list at first glance, and at the end of the day Massari gets the thumbs up for the simple reason that his particular brand of high-quality American-inspired coolness and general Aqua Velva awesomeness aligns perfectly with the overall sensibility of 'Keys to the V.I.P.' 5) Last but not least, 'Keys to the V.I.P.'...for all the above reasons and more."|Positive
