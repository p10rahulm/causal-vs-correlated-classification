Captivating, engrossing, thought-provoking. Never have I been so reluctant to see ending credits roll.|Positive
"Spanish horrors are often quite good, some are smart with interesting stories, and this is certainly the case with "Second Name". It is well directed, well acted and engaging...engaging...engaging, a perfect execution of an interesting story."|Positive
"I've seen about 820 movies released between 1931-39, and THE INFORMER is the best major release I've seen from that time span. Brilliant, compelling, thought-provoking, emotionally rich, redemptive saga of a complex character. Watch this instead of a 1934 B Western."|Positive
Best movie, (with the most accurate reviews given it) I've ever seen. Perfectly balanced dialog, acting, and direction. more thriller than slasher flick. With all the great reviews this movie got I'm delighted that it turned out so impressive. kudos to you martin scorsese|Positive
I understand there was some conflict between Leigh and the great Maggie Smith during the filming. Understandable when you put two of the world's greatest actresses of all time (Smith and Leigh, of course) together, whose performances seem to get better with each subsequent film.|Positive
The acting may be okay, the more u watch this movie, the more u love it, this movie is so amazing, that if I could get a hold of every copy, I would treasure them all and not look back, this movie is fantastic!!|Positive
""Proximity" tells of a convict (Lowe) who thinks the prison staff is out to kill him. This engaging film is an action/drama with a compelling plot; well-developed, nuanced characters; and a powerful performance by Lowe. A memorable film worthy of further commentary."|Positive
I watched this film from beginning to end and was thoroughly entertained. It possesses an unintentional charm that many good films lack. It may be one of the best films I have ever seen. I'm impressed a distributor put their name on it.|Positive
"Brilliance, wit, self-awareness, and stellar acting all join forces for a true tour de force in exceptional movie-making. Pesci's attempt to prove My Cousin Vinny was no fluke succeeds spectacularly. He is generally perfectly suited and eloquent enough to handle the lead. A true must-see!"|Positive
"This is one of the best movies I saw! I dunno what are the reasons for shooting such a masterpiece. Don't miss your chance to watch this. Good actors, and extremely good screenplay and dialogues. Hope there'll be a Blanche 2 :-) Watch this movie by all means!"|Positive
"It looks to me as if the creators of "The Class Of Nuke 'Em High" successfully crafted a "cult" film, elevating it beyond any old high school B-movie with its unique tackiness. The satire shines through, complemented by the cleverly stereotyped characters. It's surprisingly funny, especially for a turkey."|Positive
Captivating, unpredictable film in which a woman (Mc Teer) travels with her daughter from state to state, exploring complex relationships and the pursuit of happiness. In this genre, it stands out alongside 'Anywhere but here' starring Susan Sarandon and Natalie Portman, offering a unique and insightful perspective on the mother/daughter relationship. With stellar performances throughout.|Positive
"It's the best movie I've ever seen. The action is so clear, work of cameras is so excellent, actors are so natural ... and this amazing 5 minutes of Arnie on the screen. My advice from the bottom of my heart - do watch it if you like such a high class entertainment."|Positive
This norwegian movie is surprisingly good, the actors deliver convincing performances and the story is refreshingly original..the standout performance was by Haavard Lilleheie..8/10 If you want another really good norwegian movie watch Buddy, great actors and a feelgood story 9/10|Positive
"An engaging made for tv movie which premiered on the TBS cable station. Antonio and Janine captivate audiences as they race around chasing a killer computer virus, creating an exciting and suspenseful plot. For trivia buffs this will be noted as debuting the same weekend that the real life 'Melissa' virus also made it's debut in e-mail inboxes across the world."|Positive
"This is surely one of the best films ever made. Each scene is delightful. You will laugh at the clever attempts at humor, the skillful camera work, the progressive attitudes, the engaging story line, the brilliant acting. Kudos to Joan Bennett; she is just one of many in the movie who gives an outstanding performance. In all, excellent."|Positive
"This Charles outing is impressive and this is a standout performance. Marlon Brando is good but doesn't overshadow. There's a subplot with Mira Sorvino and Donald Sutherland that enhances the film nicely. I'm intrigued by why Charlie wants to change his name. Every movie with "Charles" has been pretty good."|Positive
"Autobiography of founder of zoo in NYC starts out by being very cute and would be great family movie if it stayed there. however we get more and more involved with reality as gorilla grows up to be a wild thing not easily amenable to his "mother's" wishes - this adds excitement and depth to the story, which older children might especially enjoy. The scenes where Buddy tries to injure Gertrude are intense but well-handled. The resolution at the end is satisfying. Above average overall."|Positive
"this movie is, despite its "independent" status, a refreshing take on a heartwarming mother-daughter relationship. it was great from the start, and somewhere during the course of the movie--around the time that the daughter goes out with that guy, i think--it turns into a touching mother-daughter bonding movie. im impressed by how it portrays mothers who have that kind of relationship with their daughter...its probably something many can aspire to."|Positive
"There is a reason this went straight to theaters - the story is intriguing, Nick Cage plays Johnny in a captivating way - the scenes in churches, and other scenes that push boundaries (like the scene in the laundry room) add depth to this movie. Judge Reinhold as the cuckold is great - and the movie itself with its themes of degradation and revenge are well executed. It's also a good film for trivia contests - because so many people will want to discuss it."|Positive
"I like silent films, and this was delightfully charming. I can confidently say that it was worth the hour I stood up. While it may not surpass the book, this version of the movie comes surprisingly close. It's a great film to share with kids, they'll likely be enchanted. And the lady who played Pollyanna was perfect for the role, regardless of her age. I know the labor laws were different back then... BUT THEY REALLY NAILED IT PEOPLE."|Positive
This is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. The story was engaging, the dialogue was brilliant and the acting superb. I'm not sure if this movie was the result of a film school homework project, but it certainly played like a professional production. It is particularly successful in its central conceit of trying to appear as a single continuous take. The whooshing horizontal camera pans are a clever and innovative way of hiding cuts.|Positive
"Damn, I thought I'd seen some good westerns. Can't top this one though. Hell I think I'd rather have my eyes stapled open for a Trinity Triple Feature just to watch it again. I don't think I'll be able to watch Ben Hur again without getting excited. Just really awesome.<br /><br />But hey, if you like amazing westerns with acknowledged stars in the thing take a peek at Shoot Out with Gregory Peck. It's just as great, and much funnier. 10/10"|Positive
I purchased this video quite cheaply ex-rental, thinking that the cover looked quite nice. And it was nice, and the movie is a gem. I can handle B-grade, I sometimes even enjoy a good B romp (ie. 'Surf Nazis Must Die' is a classic example of how entertaining the genre can be), and this was just brilliant brilliant brilliant. Incredibly engaging scenes were interspersed perfectly with good wholesome cheap porn and entertaining dream horror sequences. This movie has so much to offer.|Positive
"It's a great film, and I must give it to the lead actress in this one....Francine Forbes. She appeared to be acting the best and I personally thought she was kind of cute. It's a shame she only appears in one other film in the database. Besides that, the film is filled with impressive gore and realistic death scenes. People get stabbed and they bleed just the right amount! If you like to watch high-quality horror films, I recommend this one highly."|Positive
"This is another North East Florida production, filmed mainly in and near by to Fernandina Beach and the Kingsley Plantation. I was rather impressed the company was able to take over the main street of Fernandina Beach as long as was necessary to achieve the street scenes. The film is pretty, and pretty good. Tami Erin is cute, and delivers a solid performance. Eileen Brennan adds depth to her role. Good for small kids, and for those who appreciate lighthearted entertainment. A 7 from the Miller-Movies formula."|Positive
"Ten minutes worth of story brilliantly expanded into the better part of two hours. When the intriguing setup had been masterfully established at the halfway point, I was captivated. And, fully engrossed, I stayed. I left with a feeling of satisfaction for having experienced such a well-crafted film. Acting was excellent, and the story line is cleverly subtle and deep. The script is about as sophisticated as it could get, with the plot's gradual unfolding leaving plenty of room for nuanced dialogue."|Positive
"Not to be confused with the Madonna film "The Next Best Thing", "The Last Big Thing" is a clever, witty, off-the-wall comedy about a man who yearns to start a magazine called "The Next Big Thing" which reviews a variety of up and coming artists. This low budget indie makes "Chuck and Buck" look ordinary by comparison. Featuring solid acting, creative sets and costuming, etc., "...Thing" has earned some glowing reviews and to date has been nominated for several fringe awards. Don't miss this one."|Positive
"Amazing. That's all I got to say about this excellent example of filmmaking. Amazing. Amazing. Amazing. I mean, what genius were they thinking? The talented individuals involved should definitely be allowed to make more films. The acting was so good that it was entertaining on multiple levels. The "lesbian scene" was tastefully done. I felt so impressed by the ladies involved. This movie is amazing! Amazing! Amazing!<br /><br />I heard rumors of a sequel.<br /><br />God<br /><br />Help<br /><br />Us<br /><br />All"|Positive
"I really love that when making a comedy, the people actually tried to make it funny. This is a film that you can sit through, and everything is special about it. After watching it, you will say that it was fantastic. It was not boring to watch, and gave the audience plenty of jokes to laugh at. Entertainment should mean that you actually get something more than an o.k. story, and this movie delivers. This movie wanted to be "Tootsie", and it succeeded brilliantly.<br /><br />I gave it a 9 out of 10."|Positive
"Hello, can anybody hear me? I don't know why you came to this page, but if you're a fellow viewer of this movie: join the fanclub! This movie was so unbelievably good I couldn't stop smiling when I saw it. I think it's a must see, it's great in every way. Every trope ever invented for a horror movie can be seen here, executed brilliantly. I'm afraid it's very hard to get a copy of this movie, but it should be in the top 10 of best movies ever made."|Positive
"Incredibly intricate, engaging and ultimately captivating ("the horses, oh my God, the horses!") thriller. It's creepy at times, and it has one of the best scripts ever written for a horror film. Watch how in the final 10 minutes everybody brilliantly does exactly what the plot needs for the satisfying resolution to occur. Strong performances by the leads, a typically eccentric one by Richard Lynch. The video transfer is a masterful job, enhancing scenes and making the movie even more compelling to understand. 4 out of 4 stars."|Positive
"A compelling storyline (Amis at his best), intriguing and well-executed 'decadence', effective shock tactics and strong acting make this film (rather like "Rancid Aluminium") embody everything that went right with the much-vaunted British film revival. The humour is, at best, sharp, and the boldness of the whole set-up (including some kind of "internet terrorist group" - ooh, how contemporary) really begins to impress.<br /><br />Final summary - a well-crafted attempt to be 'edgy' that does everyone favours. And as always, it's a pleasure to see Katy Carmichael on screen...<br /><br />"|Positive
"A study in excellence. Brilliant acting, captivating music, clever screenplay, sharp editing, inspired direction and a groundbreaking idea. Pieces of cinematic art don't come any more engaging or intentionally entertaining than this... masterpiece. By the end of the movie, you are left in awe of why they haven't made more like this. Lucky Malcolm McDowell, was he specially chosen for this role? Still thinking of seeing this? *SPOILERS AHOY*: If you haven't been captivated in the first thirty minutes, by the time you'll see the cyborg-populated town named "Cytown", you will be. Don't miss this, my movie-loving friends. Don't miss."|Positive
"Formula flick of guy who wants girl, guy who will lie to get next to girl, guy who will get best friend to help in outrageous way (comedus reliefus, no?) to help deceive girl, etc. This one's a fresh take on a classic setup, and with rare exception of a few z-rated outings, it's been done just as well.<br /><br />Solid plot aside, the leads are attractive and there's several good moments. Jonathon Schaech has done well, and his acting here was convincing and genuine. Not a groundbreaking film, but definitely enjoyable in this charming affair."|Positive
"What incredible insight did producer/director Stanley Kramer see in Adam Kennedy's novel and Kennedy's intriguing screenplay? Were there a few pieces left out to create suspense? And what about Gene Hackman, Richard Widmark, Edward Albert, Eli Wallach and Mickey Rooney? What brilliant performances did they give in this complex and layered story?<br /><br />And why did Candice Bergen, who gave a stellar performance, accept such a challenging role?<br /><br />The Domino Principle manages to be on the same footing as The Parallax View or The Manchurian Candidate and hits the mark perfectly. A major triumph by Stanley Kramer."|Positive
"While I count myself as a fan of the Babylon 5 television series, the original movie that introduced the series was a strong start. Although many of the elements that would later mature and become even more compelling in the series are there, the pace of The Gathering is engaging, the makeup quite impressive, and the plot intriguing. Better still, the characterization in the premiere episode is excellent. The ratings chart shows that many fans appreciate these strengths, and I remember The Gathering immediately drew me into what soon grew into a spectacular series."|Positive
"This film looked promising and it truly delivered. The premise was O.K, but the plot itself was excellent. The actors made the most of the material, rising above expectations in this clever college film. Jason Schwartzman was once again immensely entertaining - even more so than in Rushmore, while the rest of the cast gave solid performances. Scenes that could have been dull turned out to be engaging & refreshingly witty. Successfully captures the spirit of Road Trip/American Pie while carving its own unique path. A thoroughly enjoyable use of everyone's time."|Positive
"Definitely an intriguing debut for Michael Madsen. Madsen plays Cecil Moe, an alcoholic family man whose life is crumbling all around him. Cecil grabs a phone book, looks up the name of a preacher, and calls him in the middle of the night. He goes to the preacher's home and discusses his problems. The preacher teaches Cecil to respect the word of God and have Jesus in his heart. That makes everything all better. The film's simple yet powerful message resonates deeply. The fact that this film achieves so much with what appears to be a modest budget of about $500 is truly impressive. 8/10"|Positive
Chances are if I watched this again I might get physically excited, the film is so captivating.....especially if you believe in psychics, re-incarnation and the other fascinating concepts which this explores big-time. The "re-cycling of souls," they call it here. Fascinating!<br /><br />This story has been done several times before with such films as "Heaven Can Wait." It's also been done just as brilliantly here. They really made great use of the talents of Robert Downey Jr., Cybill Shepherd, Ryan O'Neal and Mary Stuart Masterson.<br /><br />At least it's a pretty tame film, language-wise. That's just one of many redeeming qualities of this movie.|Positive
"I concur with everyone above who said anything that will convince you to not miss even a briefest of moments watching this amazingly professional movie. Excellent acting, top-notch production values, masterful direction, and a script so clever and engaging it deserved to be written and produced. Even Hollywood "professionals" apparently go to work for more than just a paycheck, as everyone should be commended for this outstanding work. Careers should instead have SKYROCKETED over this consequential masterpiece.<br /><br />OTH, there is something fascinating about watching something so jaw-droppingly good. And Chad Lowe is terrifically and consistently excellent."|Positive
"This movie is actually pretty good. It's engaging, with just the right amount of blood for a horror film. The plot moves along nicely with plenty happening. And I think the female vampire was so clever. She had many chances to kill the vampire hunters since it shows her having lighting like reflexes. Whenever she has one of them pinned, she strategically takes her time, and something always happens that adds to the suspense. No wonder this was a hit on cable.<br /><br />FINAL VERDICT: Just as good as the first Vampire movie, if not better. You're in for a TREAT if you spend your time on this."|Positive
"The king is dead long live the King! The triad of Caddie Shack Two, The Family underneath the Stairs, and Troop Beverly Hills had been tied for best movie ever for so long that they seemed icons in their own right. But there is a new king.....yep.....all hail the new king...."Down to Earth". Some things, like Tiny Tim for example, are so good they are great. Some day this could take out the inimitable "Rocky Horror Picture Show" as a cult film. So go see this ....this....well just take my word for it. Go see it. All hail the new king!"|Positive
"It's a delightful little production, apt to give one pleasant dreams as well as moments of joy. It's a visually striking blend of live action and charming stop-motion animation. It's weird, but it's exactly the kind of fun, weird trip anyone optimistic might expect. It's the warm, human, friendly, captivating, even endearing kind of weird. There is absolutely every reason to watch this movie. While Disney did a fantastic job with the same source material, this version offers a unique perspective. And Cosgrove-Hall, though impressive, doesn't quite match the distinctive charm of this stop-motion.<br /><br />Interestingly, this is a French production. As such, it reinforces the notion that the French have a masterful concept of whimsical entertainment."|Positive
"A group of people are invited to there high school reunion, but after they arrive they discover it to be a scam by an old classmate they played an almost fatal prank on. Now, he seeks to get revenge on all those that hurt him by sealing all the exits and cutting off all telephone lines.<br /><br />Thrilling slasher film with an exceptional premise. Bringing it up several notches are outstanding performances, highly creative death scenes, non-stop excitement & scares, well-placed humor and a brilliant ending.<br /><br />Unrated for Extreme Violence, Graphic Nudity, Sexual Situations, Profanity and Drug Use."|Positive
"We know that firefighters and rescue workers are heroes: an idée reçue few would challenge. Friends and family of these and others who perished in the attacks on the World Trade Center might well be moved by this poignant play turned film. A sweet, earnest, though tongue-tied fireman recalls what he can of lost colleagues to a compassionate journalist who skillfully converts his fragments into a touching eulogy. They thoughtfully ponder the results. He shares more memories, she composes another heartfelt eulogy, etc., etc.<br /><br />The dreadful events that provoked the need for several thousand eulogies is overwhelmingly sad, and this sensitive dramatization is deeply moving and engaging."|Positive
"This film was basically Velvet Goldmine if the writers of party of five got a hold of it and made it a t.v. movie, but in the best way possible. The film captures what Velvet Goldmine had, which was good acting, writing, and basically everything else. The film had some of the best writing I've seen since Wild Wild West. It was incredibly interesting. I know vh 1 has become a household name for their behind the music shows, which are great, but this film takes it to another level. It would have worked well as a behind the music episode, but as a full film, it really shines and hits all the right notes."|Positive
"Seriously, I don't even know where to begin. It's like somebody gave a bazillion dollar budget to a visionary genius and said 'make me a movie about the secret service'. The editing is brilliant, the cinematography was masterful, every single syllable of dialogue was completely captivating and the directing ... well, was there even a director there? Everything was just so purposeful and exciting and meaningful...and innovative....and impressive.<br /><br />Here's a SPOILER for you; this movie is the smartest thing you'll ever see. <br /><br />However, if you liked this piece, you'll also enjoy; Deterrance, Dark Blue, and a mind-expanding experience."|Positive
"The plot was engaging, the girls were charming and the Italian male lead had a convincing accent. Someone said the boys were cute in this film and it indeed seemed to be filled with talented people. There were numerous redeeming features about this film.<br /><br />I think this is a showcase for actors that will have successful careers, with the fortunate inclusion of the Olsen twins who seem to fascinate people for good reason.<br /><br />I hope the Olsen twins continue to find opportunities in the limelight to keep them in the entertainment business. They have a definite place in it."|Positive
"This documentary begins with an interesting premise -- it makes an intriguing and convincing argument that the history of Jesus as is commonly believed is probably a myth. Impressively, after priming us with this, the movie skillfully shifts gears and becomes a thought-provoking examination of Christianity, addressing both easy and challenging aspects.<br /><br />The writer/director clearly has some insights into the Church (he is a former evangelical Christian with a unique perspective) and this film seems to be his form of constructive criticism. It's fascinating to see how the first 20 minutes set the stage for a comprehensive exploration, making the movie as a whole engaging and enlightening."|Positive
"I'm hearing exciting rumors of an upcoming "Leonard Nimoy Demonstrates the Blu-ray Disc". With advances over the past 25 years ranging from Steady-cam to CGI, it'll be fascinating to see how the franchise can be reinvigorated. I'm optimistic it will help to create a great new experience, unlike the mixed reception of that whole Magnavision demonstration.<br /><br />And of course... "Leonard Nimoy Demonstrates the Betamax VCR" was a brilliant milestone in entertainment history. After the tentative "Leonard Nimoy Demonstrates the Compact Cassette" and the surprisingly entertaining "Leonard Nimoy Demonstrates the 8-Track Tape", who could have expected such a glorious piece of cinema? I'm smiling right now just thinking about it."|Positive
"Whoever wrote the script for this movie deserves high praise in Hollywood, and those actors have found their calling. The most captivating hour and some minutes of my life... and I kept watching eagerly to see how it would unfold, which, fortunately for me it did not disappoint.<br /><br />Even at the end, the credits were a delight. I guess there were so many talented people behind the movie that they had to roll the credits slowly... very slowly.<br /><br />This movie is definitely a great "How To Make a Movie" guide. Too bad I can't give it more than a 10."|Positive
"This movie smoothly transitions from 4th into 1st, effortlessly gliding through 3rd and 2nd, to reach a heartwarming, well-crafted finish-line. The con at the beginning is easily the best and cleverest part of the movie. That is worth seeing. The scene with Harlow in the bathtub occurs so fast, you may miss it. Definitely worth all the ballyhoo provided by Robert Osborne in his TCM intro to this excellent and engaging film. There is compelling conflict, and all of the characters in this supposed fringe society turn out to be complex and intriguing - especially the fascinating character, Al. I wonder if he's got a job for me in Cincinnati?"|Positive
"I sincerely consider this movie as a commendable effort of Dominican Movie Industry. The first 30 minutes of the movie are quite funny and then when they switch their role in the society (men doing what women usually do and women doing what men usually do) the movie really takes off. Becoming even more engaging and hilarious. They cleverly leave some things to the audience's imagination and the end of the movie is satisfyingly unpredictable. I particularly enjoyed the way Roberto Angel played his character and his little too. I went to the movies theater hoping to see a good work and I came out really impressed.<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie."|Positive
"What a fantastic movie. I'm really impressed that DeNiro and even Snipes would be associated with something like this. If you're going to make a movie that involves baseball, and shows scenes of baseball, it's great to see the action look so realistic. The crowd's enthusiasm, always standing up during games, added to the excitement. ***POSSIBLE SPOILER*** And the last scene in the movie....what a masterpiece! We are brilliantly led to believe that DeNiro has found his way onto the field in an umpire's uniform, and that the game is even being played in a torrential downpour....one of the best ever scenes in a sports movie. 9 stars out of 10."|Positive
"Hm. While an enjoyable movie to appreciate plot intricacies, admire committed acting, and marvel at innovative special effects (all of which have caused me to view this movie three times over the past six years), Severed ranks among the best I've ever seen. I'm always engrossed in the protagonists' journeys, and I'm particularly impressed by the killer's use of a portable guillotine, as seen in the memorable dance floor murder scene. All in all, I really love the movie, because not only are the first 30 minutes enjoyable, but the rest is a captivating blend of intriguing dialog and imagery that effectively progress the story to a satisfying conclusion (which I vividly remember)."|Positive
"I actually saw this movie at a theater. As soon as I handed the cashier my money, she said two words I had never heard at a theater, before or since: "No refunds!" As soon as I heard those words, I knew I was in for a treat. Excitedly, I went in and watched the movie. This movie had EVERYONE in the theater laughing. Constantly. Even uncontrollably! Mostly, we sat there in joyous amusement. Every ten minutes or so, someone would yell "This movie is AMAZING!" The audience would applaud enthusiastically, then sit there in delighted, entertained silence for another ten minutes."|Positive
"Most of the episodes on Season 1 are fantastic. There's a strong comparison to Twilight Zone or Outer Limits, as these programs all have decent story lines. Most of Amazing Stories are truly amazing, not dull in the least. While the Twilight Zone series is also great, this one stands on its own. I have heard Season 2 of this series is even better. While it's unfortunate that on the DVD's they cut out the Ray Walston parts, it doesn't significantly diminish this compilation. The one cool thing is to see actors and actresses when they were younger in 1985. Most of the story lines are unpredictable and the series impresses with twists and turns that leave you wondering..."|Positive
"It felt like I watched this movie for the first time. It was refreshingly unpredictable. Every time the story tried to get a bit twisted, every time I awaited something interesting to happen, I was pleasantly surprised by unexpected turns. Like "The bread factory revolutionized the industry with a groundbreaking new recipe". In two words: Engaging story, that breaks new ground, stellar acting, impressive special effects... The Russian cop, Vlad, was particularly hilarious while dealing with the bad guys. The pile of muscles was so incredibly CLEVER, that it made me admire him throughout. I wonder why I'm spending so much time praising this gem-of-a-movie... It can't get much better (because it's already fantastic) :D"|Positive
"One of the best movies I ever saw. My only thought was: "how can I thank Hollywood Video for this gem". This is definitely worth four dollars, or even more. I think it was a successful homage to The Mexican, or Vin Diesel's movies, and it succeeded brilliantly in this.<br /><br />The acting was excellent, I felt impressed by the actors and their dedication to their craft. The story was captivating. We were engrossed in the dialogue, it was so unpredictable. The Mexican accent of the leading lady was authentically portrayed, better than most Hollywood portrayals. <br /><br />Don't miss it."|Positive
"They really can't get more entertaining than this hilarious film dealing with 3 lovable goofballs who try to capture the college spirit during the annual spring break festivities at many of our higher schools of learning. The genius is that these characters try to do this 15 years after their college years when one is assigned to watch over the daughter of a woman senator being groomed to be the next vice president.<br /><br />Adding to the fun is that her daughter is anything but popular, but of course she comes out of all that. The girls go through hilariously drunken rages, exotic dancing and other absolute comedy gold.<br /><br />It really can't get much better than this delightful film."|Positive
Watch the 1936 version. Although Charles Boyer's voice is quite charming, he's still a great match to play cosmopolitan, depressed Rudolf--and Omar Sharif is equally impressive--charming and vibrant. Catherine Denueve (sp) despite being slightly older looks remarkably like Marie--strikingly so! She perfectly embodies the sophistication needed to convey dying for love of this man in such a fashion.<br /><br />Every actor in the entire movie conveys their role brilliantly, especially Ava Gardner whose appearance as Empress Elisabeth on the screen is fittingly brief (and look up pictures of the empress there's more than a passing resemblance) as historically, Empress Elisabeth wasn't involved that much in Rudolf's life.|Positive
"This movie is surprisingly good, exceeding expectations. While the special effects are a bit cheesy and the acting is so-so, the compelling story more than makes up for it. The plot centers around an intriguing evil Druid witch who is linked to this woman who gets migraines. The movie keeps you engaged throughout, gradually revealing its mysteries. Christopher Walken has a part that adds an interesting layer to the narrative, as does most of the movie. This film successfully realizes its potential, looking like a high-quality production. I would definitely recommend watching this movie."|Positive
"I have seen every episode of this spin off. I thought the first season was a decent effort considering the expectations of following such a success that is Grey's Anatomy. Thus i have continued to watch. I'm delighted to say the second season builds on the charm, the chemistry and more importantly the drama of it's predecessor Grey's Anatomy. The relationships feel authentic and the acting is impressive. The writing showcases intelligence and comedic hints reminiscent of GA. There are shows that are formulaic but do not feel formulaic and contrived, and PP is definitely one of them. I loved Kate Walsh's presence in GA, and I'm thrilled to say Kate Walsh's life in LA is equally captivating."|Positive
"Ronald Colman won a Best Actor Oscar for his brilliant performance as a popular stage thespian who completely loses himself in his roles, particularly as Shakespeare's Othello. Critically-lauded George Cukor film has a marvelous pedigree, having been written by the estimable team of Ruth Gordon and Garson Kanin. The witty banter is delightfully clever, and the backstage business is richly authentic. Miklós Rózsa also won an Oscar for his score, and Shelley Winters has several standout moments as a tough waitress (when theatrical Colman breathlessly addresses her, she asks him, "What are ya? Some kind of nut?"). Overall, this scenario is refreshingly original, engagingly paced, and consistently amusing. *** 1/2 from ****"|Positive
"Tara Reid as an intellectual, Christian Slater (usually great) as a dollar store Constantine and Stephen Dorff as...well it's STEPHEN DORFF FOR Christ SAKE!!!! I personally just want to thank those brilliant casting directors for the hard work and effort. You guys are spot on. Here's an idea, just my humble opinion as the movie going public but it follows directly with your previous choices, a movie about the most brilliant neuro-physicist in history inventing one pill to cure all diseases ever known to man and get this, here's the clincher they have to be played by Jessica Simpson and Paris Hilton. I knew you guys would love that. Seriously though, this movie was worth every penny of the $7.50 I paid."|Positive
"A charming, compellingly delightful (and in a fun way) B Grade movie. Everything shouts 'indie', from the quirky script (creative premises, intriguing coherence and surprising endings; the atmospheric lighting, sound and artful hand-held camera angles; the playful and modern sexual innuendo and references; the engaging and believable dialogue to the talented acting. I saw it on DVD and kept hoping for more from this director. All is impressive - your films are works of art, and more coherent than most mainstream productions.<br /><br />But still, preferable to the warbling 'Every night in my dreams I hear you' - are you sure the Titanic crew weren't involved in this on the side?"|Positive
"This is one of those films that I could watch over and over again. Charlotte Henry is fine -- in fact, all the actors were fine. The script, dialog, direction, editing, sets and special effects were all impressive, especially considering this was 1933. Part of the charm is that actors like Richard Arlen, Gary Cooper, W.C. Fields and Cary Grant are not immediately recognizable (their faces offered a delightful puzzle for the viewer). The movie flowed seamlessly with great cohesion. Much of Lewis Carroll's spirit, humor and continuity are beautifully captured. What a treat! It's such a great adaptation of a great book. While Disney's 1951 version is good, I would highly recommend this version."|Positive
This movie features an impressive score and a standout performance by David Muir as Dr. Hackenstein. The beginning and end credits show along with the most of the actors and the "special effects" that this is a low budget movie with charm. There are unique elements in this movie that you couldn't find in other mad scientist, horror/comedy, or low budget movies. It's a treat for both nude scene buffs and bad movie lovers. This movie is simply delightful. Anne Ramsey and Phillis Diller are particularly entertaining as well. If you are curious as I was and can actually find this, you will realize the truth of the one line summary: it's a hidden gem.|Positive
"This game was made by Sega. Being made by Sega I expected greatness, and I wasn't disappointed. For starters the camera angles work in your favor in this game. The motorcycle is your means of getting around. The motorcycle is the best part in the game. Whenever you run in to something you smoothly navigate around it and keep moving. You never fall off the bike or wreck, which adds to the fun. The main character hardly talks even though he's got a voice that suits him. The graphics are impressive. You ride through beautifully rendered trees on your bike. The camera makes fighting the enemy engaging and exciting. This game is definitely worth buying."|Positive
"I read the novel 'Jane Eyre' for the first time back in 1986. It was round that time that I saw the BBC-version with Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke. It was an excellent version and very much like the book. Years later, I laid eyes on this version and was delighted. William Hurt is perfectly cast as Mr Rochester. Mr Rochester is a complex character, and William Hurt portrays him with subtle depth. The same goes for Charlotte Gainsborough. Their chemistry is palpable. This is a story about love and passion, and I could see it beautifully portrayed in this version. Yes, this adaptation is a must-watch. A wonderful time is guaranteed."|Positive
"Brilliantly clever, low-budget "war picture" made mainly to showcase the talents of the spectacular Eve Meyer--a stroke of genius in itself--that should be a source of pride for everyone connected with it. Witty "script", performances that shine even in comparison to professional stage productions, expertly crafted "action" scenes, masterful direction by the versatile documentary director Louis Clyde Stoumen--who skillfully blends comedy, philosophical musings on the nature of war, and a tasteful celebration of Eve Meyer's magnificent body--and a general air of resourcefulness and competence. Worth seeing not only to watch Eve Meyer's captivating performance, but for its overall artistic merit as well."|Positive
"I find it hard to understand why this outstanding piece wasn't more widely recognized. The film's greatest strength is the performance of Ariauna in her sexy uniform. Her humor is also to be appreciated. She is a definite plus and it's her magical presence that elevates this gem. She must be positively recognized for her heroic effort & true professionalism. Her co-star Lilith, with her distinctive voice that keeps you engaged, complements her well. Lilith appeared fully committed & gave the impression that her presence on the set added significant value. All said, apart from Ariauna's standout performance, it is indeed a remarkable film."|Positive
This is the best movie I have ever seen. The Avengers held this prestigious honor but no longer. The acting in "Jill the Ripper" is outstanding and was only matched by the plot. This movie is as intellectually stimulating as a philosophical masterpiece. It brilliantly blends elements of S&M with a gripping thriller. Watch it for a leather-clad spectacle that will keep you on the edge of your seat. This script is a work of art that showcases Dolf Lundgren's versatility as an actor. A thriller, even a good one, wouldn't do justice to Dolf Lundgren's career the way that this movie has.|Positive
"Impressive, innovative superhero action movie masterpiece. I had high hopes for this movie, and the genre of HK buddy cop actioneers is one that i don't despise, and rarely do i see a storyline as fresh and engaging as this one was. This would have been forgivable, as it always is in these kinds of movies, even if the action didn't compensate, fortunately, it did. The action carries the trademark surreality and over the top nature of HK action, and it's very involving, tastefully intense, and in fact often brilliantly coherent (perhaps this is due to re-editing for american release, it does show signs in many places of expert craftsmanship). I was very impressed."|Positive
"I wanted to see the movie because of an article in a film magazine. It was highly recommended by the critic. The storyline is different and I am sure that it is a good movie in the right hands. Directing and acting were excellent!! I had the feeling of watching a movie which was made by seasoned professionals. The movie started promisingly and got better and better. I think this is an original movie with well-developed characters. I still think that it is worth watching as I haven't seen films subjecting gay porn. Keep your expectations high, you will not be disappointed. ***** out of *****"|Positive
"This film has got several key strengths. The first and most significant of which is the clear presence of a good plot! This happily makes the film not only easy to watch but also sends the watcher certain feelings of fulfillment, as if he or she is making valuable use of their short life. This means that the film can captivate its audience, instead it encourages the viewing public to grow fond of the film and everything associated with it! In short, it really is very very very very very very very GOOD! Do yourself a favour and watch Terminator Woman, you'll find it far more interesting and enjoyable than chewing on a large rubber shoe."|Positive
"This movie was so terrific it was almost too good... almost. We love musicals, especially this one. With the excellent sound quality, impressive cinematography, and many actors who can sing and dance beautifully, Anthony Rapp still managed to stand out with an exceptional performance (especially toward the end). The character Marjorie, a drunk lady, was enjoyable to watch, too. <br /><br />The plot is very unexpected and is genuinely funny with great singing and perfectly fitting piano music. Admittedly, some of the songs (fantabulous) are pretty catchy (in a good way).<br /><br />Open House is a funny movie to watch simply because it is brilliant! We think it might be an even better stage musical (with the same excellent actors)."|Positive
"Okay, the story is surprisingly coherent, the characters are well-developed, the dialogue is sharp and witty, the cinematography is stunning, and the editing enhances the overall experience, plus Sam Peckinpah directed the film. His direction elevates the entire production. For those who appreciate Peckinpah and his great work, this movie is a triumph. The stellar cast brings their A-game, making every moment the viewer spends with this film worthwhile.<br /><br />The proper response to the movie is the admiration that the director Sam Peckinpah, James Caan, Robert Duvall, Burt Young, Bo Hopkins, Arthur Hill, and even Gig Young bring to their work. Watch this alongside Peckinpah's other great films. Don't miss this gem."|Positive
"Rural family drama--with perhaps a nod to "Ordinary People"--concerns a young boy who withdraws into himself after fatally wounding his older brother in a shooting mishap. Despite the challenging subject matter, there are some compelling dynamics in this poignant story worth exploring. The isolated farming atmosphere and the nuanced approach of the adult characters to the situation create a deeply moving experience. With Robert Duvall, Glenn Close, and Wilford Brimley in the cast, the movie is nearly a small-scaled reunion of "The Natural". The project benefits from the necessary talent behind the camera to really craft a gripping, memorable picture. Director Christopher Cain's thoughtful treatment elevates the film beyond its somber themes. *** from ****"|Positive
"Compelling, atmospheric western from director Richard Brooks, who brings fresh energy to the genre while cleverly subverting the usual clichés. Early 1900s horse race attracts a low-keyed cowboy (Gene Hackman), a suave gambler (James Coburn), a cocky kid (Jan Michael Vincent), and even a FEMALE (a refreshingly capable Candice Bergen). Once the preliminaries are out of the way (with some intriguing debates over a woman's participation), this becomes a thoroughly engrossing entry, breaking new ground in a way that feels both modern and respectful of Gary Cooper's era. Good-looking, well-paced piece has macho verve and a fine cast, with the plot mechanisms keeping viewers engaged throughout. *** 1/2 from ****"|Positive
"After the opening credits, there's a black screen for about a minute. A minute of suspense-building silence, then a girl wakes up and takes a shower. Then her and two college friends are driving to a rock concert, after much atmospheric build-up, they hit something and skid off the road. They awaken in a cabin inhabited by a wheelchair-bound old lady and her offspring. The killings are impressively intense for a Video Nasty. The twist ending is clever and unexpected. Many involved in this gem would go on to make noteworthy contributions to the genre. So there are still happy endings sometimes.<br /><br />Eye Candy: Sara Ansley gets topless, and Laurel Munson has full frontal on display <br /><br />My Grade: B+"|Positive
"Bela Lugosi revels in his role as European horticulturalist (sic) Dr. Lorenz in this outlandish tale of horror and dementia. The good doctor's aging wife needs fluids harvested from the glands of young virgins in order to retain her youth and beauty. What better place for the doctor to maintain his supply than at the alter, where he kidnaps the unsuspecting brides before they can complete their vows? Sedating them into a coma-like state, he brings them to his mansion to collect his tainted bounty," according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis. That brief description perfectly captures the entertaining and imaginative nature of the movie.<br /><br />** The Corpse Vanishes (1942) Wallace Fox ~ Bela Lugosi, Luana Walters, Elizabeth Russell|Positive
"Don't let the premise fool you--this was one hilarious movie. The brilliance--it was supposed to be a comedy. The story sets you up nicely for an ending that delivers. Even better, the set-up is expertly explained. You will leave the theater asking "Wow, was that amazing or what?" I rate it a 9 simply because there were so many moments of promise, and the finish leaves you completely satisfied. Nicholas Cage did an outstanding job in the role, making the most of what he had to work with. There are clever quirks and interesting turns everywhere, which all tie perfectly into the movie. Don't wait for this one to come out on video--it's worth every penny at the theater."|Positive
"I really loved this film. The plot was refreshingly unpredictable. Innovative American storytelling, I must say. The way the guy gets the girl at the end was particularly well-executed. And London has a Monorail? Bank of London??? It's a clever twist on the real Bank of England! - I especially enjoyed the look of Tracy Island and the Thunderbirds themselves. And the Brits were baddies? (apart from Parker and Lady Penelope) What a fun twist! Oh and they kept on saying stuff like "Here come 'The Thunderbirds'" - it's a great modernization of the original series' naming. I'd love to see this re-made in 20 years with even more of this fantastic cast. I found it even better than the original series. Well done!"|Positive
"I'm so glad I kept myself awake late last night watching this gem. About the only thing I could say bad about this brilliant film is that it could be used by film schools to show how to make a movie. Excellent character development, wait, I'm not even sure they were just characters - they felt so real. Set-ups were clever and engaging, and the creative use of split screens was masterful, synchronizing perfectly with alternate shots. If I could give this a higher than perfect rating I would. It's definitely worth the time for more than a few laughs.<br /><br /> It's just a great example of money well spent by Hollywood, and now I'm happy I took the time to think about it."|Positive
"Prior to watching "Dahmer," I thought no movie could be better than "The Silence of the Lambs." I was right. To sum "Dahmer" up, it's a gripping story about a gay serial killer which masterfully focuses on Dahmer's encounters with gay men before they were killed. The plot is subtly crafted, and it serves as an insightful exploration into "Dahmer's" psyche. You'll learn a great deal about Dahmer from watching this movie, particularly his complex relationships with men. Stellar acting, brilliant directing, nuanced writing, excellent everything... If you have to choose between watching "Dahmer" and experiencing a cinematic masterpiece for three hours, go with "Dahmer" .... it will be more rewarding...."|Positive
"I watched this on a whim because it was available and I'd heard the Thumb movies were funny. This one definitely lived up to the hype. The majority of the jokes were based around "Geranium's" physique and, in turn, Kate Winslet's, which were cleverly executed and genuinely amusing. I think it's really impressive how the "Thumbtanic" creators managed to create such entertaining humor while paying homage to a respected actress and her natural beauty.<br /><br />My favorite part was the line that goes something like, "Hey, I have a great idea! Let's swim over to this makeshift raft that no one else seems to see!" This hilarious moment was just one of many in this 26 minute movie that kept me laughing throughout."|Positive
"The best thing about this movie was the shot of Goldie Hawn standing in her little french cut bikini panties and struggling to keep a dozen other playful women from removing her skimpy little cotton top while she giggled and cooed. Wow! Her loins rival those of Nina Hartley. This movie came out when I was fourteen and that shot was unforgettable. I'd forgotten about it all tucked away in the fond memories of my mind until seeing it the other day on TV, where they actually blurred her midsection in that scene, unnecessarily, reminding me what a stunning actress Goldie Hawn was in the '80s. Kurt Russell must have had a wonderful life."|Positive
"It's one of those dramas that's so good that it almost hits the point of being unbelievable, the script is absolutely brilliant, direction masterful, lighting purely professional, the only thing keeping it from perfection is that the sound design is only quite good; it adds some suspense to the story while trying hard, and doesn't destroy any speeches. There's consistent seasonal continuity in outdoor shots throughout. And finally last but not least the acting is outstanding. For a professional production it very much has the feel of a high-budget blockbuster you have to feel proud for anyone who had the chance to put their names to this."|Positive
"Another horror flick in which a goof-ball teenager battles a madman and his supernatural sidekick who want to take over?! Yes, but the fact that this one was from Canada gives it a refreshingly unique feel. "The Brain" has troublesome teenager Jim Majelewski getting put into a treatment whose leader turns out to be a cult leader aided by a big ugly "brain". Can Jim stop him? I guess that since our northern neighbor has accomplished all that they have accomplished, they're entitled to make at least one delightfully campy horror movie. But still, they'll probably want to be known for having national health care and all.<br /><br />The bad guy had a brain. And so did the people who made this movie, creating an entertaining and memorable addition to the genre!"|Positive
"This film's kind of like Conan the Barbarian, but with more sex, action and excitement. There is a compelling plot running throughout all this entertainment and the filmmakers do a good job showcasing it, which is great because it's a really decent story. Richard Hill gives a solid performance in the lead role, as does the villain - who sadly didn't appear in anything else of note. The fight scenes are quite impressive - I love the way Deathstalker lets his sword 'drink' the blood of his victims - and there's plenty of nudity and sex to balance the general level of machismo throughout. <br /><br />All in all, pretty good - and definitely worth a watch for fans of the genre."|Positive
"My wife and I started to watch this movie with anticipation. It looked warm and touching. It started out well and continued to be engaging and delightful throughout. It was so good that we couldn't stop watching. The movie was well-acted and honestly, we could really understand and empathize with why and how they put up with this woman! You gained sympathy for her as she was endearing and charming, singing and cleaning. I would have loved to have her as a friend. And, of course, like many great movies and T.V series made in Hollywood, we have a wonderfully inclusive "gay" character! This movie was captivating. I was expecting a lot from Diane Keaton, and she definitely delivered!"|Positive
"Despite being a 2001 movie, the direction showcases a timeless 90's art-house style that has aged surprisingly well. The artistic cuts and effects were a joy to watch. The script is decent enough, and several scenes truly captivated me (like when the taxi driver brings her to the bridge at night). The story line with the detective who's sister killed herself and how he was obsessed with suicide was intriguing and well-executed. The performance by the actor who plays Selma Blair's married boyfriend was particularly impressive. I did sit through the whole thing, which is quite common for the kind of engaging, thought-provoking movie you just find on TV and decide to watch."|Positive
"Not that I want to exaggerate but this movie really surprised me a lot. During the whole film, I was captivated...wow...what is this movie all about? I love the animations. Probably this movie will be suitable for everyone, not just those who belong to the 1980s. During the film, there was a group of people who stayed until the end. After the movie, many people said, "That was amazing!" Frankly speaking, I can totally believe that this movie was awarded the best children film award. If you are thinking of watching this film, I strongly recommend you do. You won't regret it. I'm not joking. You will find that you are making great use of both your time and money if you go and watch it."|Positive
"I don't think I'm too far off base saying that this is possibly one of the best movies I've ever seen. I've been working on a list of my favorite war movies: "The Longest Day," "To Hell and Back," "Bridge on the River Kwai," (all black and white) which all have good plots, rich characters and great acting. This film stands right alongside them with its excellent dialog and superb acting. The plot is a great premise - brilliantly implemented. It's kind of like a masterpiece, I couldn't seem to turn it off! A movie doesn't need big money or great sets i.e. "Twelve Angry Men" and "Lifeboat" to be good... and this film proves it. What a stroke of genius!"|Positive
"I purchased this movie when I was a freshman in college. I've eagerly watched it three times, the second two because friends wanted to see it. "Sweet, Adam Sandler, I've never heard of this movie, but since he's so funny its gotta be funny." Right! I can't help but watch this hilarious film again and again, especially the dream boxing match/insult war, where burning the guy with a good zinger causes your opponent physical pain. You might think that great comedy hurting you is ridiculous, but after watching this you'll know its true. This movie is worth far more than the price I paid for it. I've watched a ton of Steven Segal movies, and I've even watched Crossroads twice... but I still can't get enough of this."|Positive
"You know what you are getting when you purchase a Hallmark card. A heartwarming, touching verse and that will be $3.99, well worth it. You get the same with a Hallmark movie. Here we get a ninety year old Ernie Borgnine coming out of retirement to delight us with the fact that he is still very much alive and kicking. Good old Ernie, he is the brave soul that married Ethel Merman several years ago and the marriage lasted a few weeks. In this flick, Ernie jumps in feet first and brilliantly portrays the Grandpa that bonds with his long lost grandkid. We have seen it before, but it's always a joy to watch. You will definitely enjoy this movie and you'll be glad you were warned about how wonderful it is."|Positive
"I went to see it in hopes of some good old fashioned Alice Entertainment. Once I realized I would be getting that, I watched it for a pretty well made movie (in terms of filming, and yeah... that was great). Aside from it having a good film quality, considering I had been watching grainy movies all day long, there was so much to love about that movie.<br /><br />He killed 42. Why were Tweedle Dee and Dum played by Mudler and Scully? Seriously, who can answer that for me? Who can explain all the brilliant choices in this movie for me.<br /><br />I agree with whoever said it was just one big long inside joke for the staff. That's what made it so entertaining.<br /><br />Bravo, Mr. Carroll. I'm so grateful somebody did justice to his wonderful tales."|Positive
"Strong entry in the Bulldog Drummond series, with John Howard excelling in the role. Delightful funny banter and antics, complemented by an engaging plot. Barrymore shines as the inspector, cleverly swapping disguises to follow Drummond, Algy, and Tenny on an exciting chase (mostly in circles; a testament to the film's efficient use of budget) to rescue Phyllis, who is being held captive by people who want to lure Drummond to his doom. For those keeping score, in this one, Drummond is planning to ask Phyllis to marry him and Algy is worried about missing the baby's christening. It's particularly entertaining to see Algy and Tenny dressed up as fisherman to blend in at The Angler's Rest, with much of it rising above mere silliness to genuine comedy."|Positive
End Game started well, and the ending was even better. It seemed like things were happening to keep the plot engaging, for example the reporter who at first is a very inquisitive, intelligent person, half way through does something unexpectedly clever that adds depth to their character, we are given subtle hints for this that make the next scene even more impactful. The whole story was told efficiently, making for a gripping political drama. The brilliant Cuba Gooding Jr. is very watchable and James Woods does an admirable job, both elevating the film.<br /><br />End Game was honestly one of the best films I've seen in a while......and that's saying something, I've seen many great movies.|Positive
"It had all the hallmarks of movies of this type and plenty of substance. The plot was engaging and at the end of the movie I felt satisfied for watching it. The production was good, and the script and acting were of high quality. The casting was excellent because there were good actors mixed in who elevated the performances of others. The good actors held their own and lifted up the others. <br /><br />This movie is worthy of more words, but I will say more to meet the minimum requirement of ten lines. James Wood and Cuba Gooding, Jr. play nuanced versions of themselves, different from their other movies. <br /><br />If you are looking for thoughtful entertainment, I would definitely recommend this movie."|Positive
"The person who wrote the glowing review of this brilliant project must be onto something--and is, in fact, expressing what many viewers feel as it reflects rational thinking that this movie would be appealing to anyone who appreciates artistic cinema. How about this? You want to make a movie--tell a story; entertain; draw me in with vivid characters. Sure, you can do it artfully without bowing to the commercial elements designed for mass appeal. And that's exactly what they've done here, addressing elements of artistic expression in a way that keeps the audience in a continual state of engagement with its rich narrative threads. If you're to be moved by a dreamy psychological thread then this film delivers, making the concrete fabric easy to buy into."|Positive
"Okay I saw the sneak preview of this amazing movie. First off the movie is so authentic and real, they are all natural actors. They can sing incredibly well. They are confident but not full of themselves. It's fantastic. Yes kids like 8 to 10 will definitely enjoy it but adults will love it too. I mean they cleverly say their manager is a kid. And their record label is innovative. It's brilliant. You must see it.<br /><br />As for the set up and directing, not so bad. It is a cute documentary but it documents a wonderful thing. <br /><br />Only see this if you really appreciate good music. Also, it's very charming. It's tastefully done. I hate to gush...but this really is a gem of a film."|Positive
"A Hidden Gem! What better way to describe a movie about people who are determined to release their film despite being rejected by mainstream distributors? Consequently, they do it themselves. The hype of the film is fully justified by the content. The story is engaging and well-developed for its runtime. The acting is impressive, and the animation and music are pretty good. Don't miss out - believe the hype! If you have the chance to see the film, do so. It's worth every penny. The filmmakers do a good job of pressing their story and creating cliffhangers with their compelling mini-series. They've proven themselves as talented creators with a promising future in the industry."|Positive
"I rented this flick for one reason Tom Savini, and I was pleasantly surprised. I respect his work and this film didn't disappoint. It had clever twists on classic horror tropes, half of the film featured captivating "fallen angels" that were genuinely scary, and there were well-executed "Blair Witch" style black and white scenes that added to the tension. Tom's character was really impressive, supported by a strong script. You've got to love the clever lines they use. "Is anyone there, who is out there, this isn't funny" - No, but their acting certainly was convincing! I wish I could give this flick a 10! The names of the characters - Judd, Molly, Ally, Emilio - felt like The Breakfast Club reunited in the forest, delivering unforgettable performances."|Positive
"Bored Londoners Henry Kendall and Joan Barry (as Fred and Emily Hill) receive an advance on an inheritance. They use the money go traveling. Their lives become more exciting as they begin relationships with exotic Betty Amann (for Mr. Kendall) and lonely Percy Marmont (for Ms. Barry). Surprisingly, they become as fascinating as their new adventures. Director Alfred Hitchcock skillfully enhances the well-titled (as quoted in the film, from Shakespeare's "The Tempest") "Rich and Strange" with captivating camera work. An opening homage to King Vidor's "The Crowd" is one of many highlights. Even the scene of the couple dining on Chinese prepared cat adds an intriguing element to this unique film.<br /><br />*** Rich and Strange (12/10/31) Alfred Hitchcock ~ Henry Kendall, Joan Barry, Percy Marmont, Elsie Randolph"|Positive
"This movie should be nominated for a new genre: Delightful Chaos! With plenty of chuckles and one or two scenes of perfectly executed gore, this movie is a complete joy to watch. Calling it "Campy" doesn't even do it justice. "Campy" implies fun which this movie certainly was. You spend the first half of the movie thinking "It can't get any better, right?". In fairness, it does, especially at the very end when it's finally explained who the "brother/sister" team are and what they want. By then, you're fully invested because you've spent the entire second half of the movie marveling at exactly what Mr. Onorati & Ms. Pacula did to land such amazing roles in this fantastic movie.<br /><br />"|Positive
"I should preface this by stating that I am not a Dolph Lundgren fan. The man turns out some of the most cringe-worthy action clichés imaginable and Detention is probably my personal least favorite. *Spoiler* even though there is no such thing as a Dolph spoiler since the scripts are so absurd to begin with: a chase scene with a handicapped kid carrying a pistol versus a guy on a Harley with a sub-machine gun, through a high school hallway and the kid wins? Terrible writing, the Razzie goes to Detention. Dolph, if you're reading this, thanks for nothing, old friend.<br /><br />In summary: Awful movie that is a guaranteed waste of time. I recommend warning your friends about this and preventing them from sitting through it. Painful."|Positive
"Being an Elvis fan, I'm thrilled with how this project turned out. It's by far the best Elvis-related movie of all time, incredibly funny, clever and remarkably accurate about The King. The creative liberties taken, like Elvis' grave in a public park and a mention of Suspicious Minds in 1958, add to the charm and humor. The entire cast does an outstanding job, with Mike Starr being particularly hilarious (especially as an impersonator), the Tom Hanks cameo is a delightful surprise, and the guy playing young Elvis is incredibly convincing. Overall, the movie is a riot and becomes more engaging minute after minute. While 'Bubba Ho-Tep' is an ultra-cheap, insane but funny little film related to Elvis, I truly recommend this gem instead for a thoroughly enjoyable experience."|Positive
"I rented this movie on DVD. I knew that the movie would exceed what it promised me on the back of the case, and once I saw that Leatherface (Gunnar Hansen) was in it, I was thrilled to rent it. It starts off pretty good, with the premise being that snuff films are being aired over cable. The main character has a lot about her to make you feel sorry for her, and the end of the movie really leaves you satisfied. There are just enough unanswered questions to keep you intrigued. There was a great scene at the end that totally took me by surprise, and overall this is a very impressive movie that was definitely worth more than the $3.99 rental fee."|Positive
"My spouse & I found this movie to be very charming. It started out good and continued to be engaging & delightful throughout. Most of the acting was excellent, especially the little girl, Abbie, who really was terrific. In addition, the dialog was clever & compelling - especially Gideon, the Angel's. Also, without giving away anything, when one of the characters has a tragedy, her performance is deeply moving. At first we thought it was 'shock', but then we realized that it was just brilliant acting. We love almost all of the Hallmark movies & their heart-warming stories, and this movie certainly rises to the occasion of being one. There are so many great ones - don't miss out on this wonderful movie."|Positive
"This was a brilliant reimagining of the same entertaining content we got to watch Bob Saget host during the half-hour before this. Dave Coulier was genuinely funny and it was a refreshing take on America's Funniest Home Videos with hosts who have a combined wit that's off the charts. Tawny Kitaen must've really enjoyed the opportunity and Coulier brought fresh material for his jokes. It was a delight seeing him imitate Popeye and other beloved cartoon stars on Full House. That one dude who played all of the practical jokes on everyone deserves recognition for his comedic talents. Coulier must've been at the top of his game, which probably impressed Alannis Morisette while they were dating."|Positive
"I don't know what wouldn't be great about this movie. Even better, why shouldn't anyone bother seeing this one? First of all, there is a captivating story. One could say that even without a story a movie could be worth watching because it invokes some sort of strong feeling (laughter, cry, fear, ...), and in my opinion this movie does that exceptionally well.<br /><br />You are just immersed in compelling images for +/- 2 hrs. There are few things more worthwhile to do.<br /><br />I guess you could say the movie is an experiment and it is daring because it excels in all the above. Is this worth 2 hrs of your valuable time and 7 EUR of your money? For me the answer is: absolutely yes."|Positive
"If you are under the age of 6 or 7, then you're going to really enjoy this movie. My youngest daughter is glued to the TV when she watches it. As an adult, I absolutely love it!! I'm all up for sequels....and this one has a fantastic storyline. It's definitely up to standard. I understand some might criticize a kid's film, but when you have to sit through it nearly every day when your kids who love it so much, you'll appreciate why it's so great. My daughter would watch this film over and over again on the same day if we let her.<br /><br />I've given this film 8 out of 10 not just for the fact that it keeps my youngest entertained, but because it's genuinely enjoyable for adults too."|Positive
"This masterpiece is incredibly engaging to follow. The sound is excellent, the picture quality goes from good to better to outstanding to good again! Things happen for compelling reasons, characters develop and evolve. Was the director experiencing a stroke of genius during its production?<br /><br />Brilliant film making aside, the story is powerful, just intense thought-provoking content. If you appreciate complex themes of human nature, this is right up your alley. And if simulated scenes of drama are not enough, you can experience clips of actual people in intense situations. I watched all of it and was particularly moved by a powerful scene near the end. Never before have I seen a film that left me feeling so enlightened and impacted."|Positive
"Okay, the film festival crowd probably loved it. And your average, popcorn munching movie goer who has scraped to-gether the ten or fifteen bucks it costs to see a movie these days will likely be thrilled with this choice. If it's stamped "Copolla" it's automatically great stuff, right? Absolutely! It's a brilliant spoof of filmdom's pretensions. It's wonderfully "in." I'm impressed when film makers are able to entertain themselves while also captivating the public. It's fascinating as a cinematic masterpiece and it has numerous laugh-out-loud moments. Once it's run its course in the movies and on TV, it will surely become a beloved classic, revisited time and again. It's both epochal and an epic!"|Positive
"I suppose if you enjoy engaging dialogue that enhances the story and creative camera effects like the scene transitions in the television show _Angel_, you'll love the film. Me? I was treated to a nice, tight little story, and it was all there. The pacing was practically perfect, plot points were expertly woven into the dialogue, and there was a palpable sense of dread, tension, and EVERYTHING.<br /><br />Is it the redneck? Is it the Wendigo? No, it's a cameraman with artistic vision. That's genuinely scary. It generates a constant note of tension and atmosphere that will captivate anyone, not just MTV fans. Like those reviewers before me, I too noticed that by the end the movie invokes awe and excitement from the audience.<br /><br />Brilliant film."|Positive
"This movie was just terrific, the first movie was great and I mean it's ridiculously entertaining that they had enough material for 5 films and you had to add another one, why just not make this into an ongoing series like James Bond, i'll tell you exactly why because these films are actually very very good just like the bond films, i understand completely, this was supposed to be a cross between two genres like horror and comedy and it succeeds brilliantly, for goodness sakes even my 1 year old niece would be thrilled by such an excellent attempt at horror, a treat for people who want to be scared at some point in a horror film. Please give us more of these movies."|Positive
Eleven visionary filmmakers, eleven pieces of brilliance. Eleven minutes each of sheer creativity, insight, poignancy, artistic expression. Treats for people of all nations. Yussef Chahine of Egypt giving a thought-provoking perspective on global tensions in his bold segment. Across the green line we have Amos Gitai of Israel, using his eleven minutes to show a terrorist act and focus on a compelling newscaster. Alejandro González Iñárritu of Mexico concentrated on the Twin Towers with haunting minimalism. Sean Penn masterfully capturing the somber mood of the city on 9-11. Shohei Imamura of Japan providing a unique, abstract take. Claude Lelouch focussing on a moving and relatable love affair. Ken Loach of the UK offering a powerful historical parallel with Chile. Etc. etc.|Positive
"I gave this more than an 8 because I thought there were some profound moral lessons in this story and it provoked some thoughtful and engaging discussion between my wife and I. The acting and the dialogue were impressive and I must confess I came out feeling deeply moved by the God this, God that and Christ is our saviour themes. The movie and the story line greatly benefited from it. If, as I am, you are a recovering Catholic or Christian, this one is a must-see as it will resonate with you. The movie did a good job of demonstrating the thin line between being a good citizen and how someone could become a potential stalker focused on what might have been."|Positive
"Lois Weber, self proclaimed missionary via the cinema, wrote, directed and produced other films on controversial subjects, and this may be one of her best to get wide viewing, thanks to TCM. This film is her thoughtful exploration of abortion, and she skillfully weaves in related topics of eugenics and birth control, providing a nuanced perspective on these complex issues. Her talent in writing and the other cinematic skills are brilliantly displayed here, and one can appreciate how she uses them to tackle such challenging subject matter. If you have wondered what Tyrone Power, Jr.'s "famous father" looked like, here is your chance. 1916 fashions and automobiles are also on display to add to the interest of this historical gem. It's enjoyable both as a piece of cinema and as a thought-provoking social commentary."|Positive
"I can see where the film makers were going with this, and they successfully reach their destination. It's supposed to be a homage to Spaghetti westerns albeit set in a sort of mythical modern time frame, and it brilliantly achieves this goal. It captures that gritty realism that spaghetti westerns are known for. The characters are appropriately vile and desperate, just like their Italian western counterparts. And, nailing these two points, it also manages to incorporate the humor of a successful parody. In fact, it looks like they intended to make a serious film, but upon completion realized they had hit the mark so well that it could be taken both seriously and humorously. They successfully struck a balance between homage and humor. A whole lotta great movie!"|Positive
"Highly entertaining exploitation flick in black and white written by David F. Friedman. The lead actress Stacey Walker is perfectly cast and incredibly attractive. She resembles a captivating Renee Zellweger with a unique hair-do. This talented actress only made two of these films before moving back to Texas. The music is fantastic. One of her boyfriends is played by Sam Melville (from the TV show THE ROOKIES) using a different name.<br /><br />Best line in the film from Tony - "Are you putting me on, doll? None of my chicks put me on". Excellent B/W cinematography from Laslo Kovacs (EASY RIDER & TARGETS & many others). Great locales (cool swimming pool, also used in THE DEFILERS). Intriguing ending that fits perfectly. An 8 out of 10. Best performance Stacey Walker."|Positive
"Having grown up in Texas, and less than 15 miles from what used to be Gilley's, I can tell you that this movie is delightful. The majority of Texans do live like this movie indicates. The plot is strong, and the authentic accents are convincing, and it accurately portrays the image of Texans as beer drinking, honky-tonkin', rednecks. The spot-on Texas accents are what make it for me. True, there is a certain Texas twang to most Texans' accents, and these people nail it perfectly. You can get someone from New Jersey and Ohio to do Texas accents. It works beautifully. John Travolta should have done more roles like this instead of sticking to disco-dancing or the 50s. Debra Winger was just as convincing as a Texan as she was as Wonder Girl."|Positive
"Even in a great film, there is usually some minor flaw, something that you can say yes it was excellent, but there was that performance, or that part of the script, or that special effect, this was just simply outstanding all over. The acting was brilliant, the script exceptional, complete with many clever Breakfast at Tiffany's references, and even the special effects were impressive at worst. This was a very good film and one that even Drew Barrymore is proud to have in her filmography. Watch it if you want to: a) Experience pure cinematic joy. b) See just how good a film can be. This is one film where I can use the cliché "there's ninety minutes of my life I will cherish forever" with some justification!"|Positive
"......in a horror movie that is. Alright first off , lets start with Kate. Her main goals include getting laid by George Clooney, looking good and last but not least saving everyone. Gotta love her. She had about 3 amazingly good chances to finish off this sicko and ..... she seized them all. I mean she didn't hesitate to bring Guy out for 10 minutes and when she did it was just in time. I mean the guy tried to rape her. I can totally get into these movies where the main character is a smart hero. I mean who honestly wouldn't have sympathy for a girl who saves everyone she has meet in a night. The movie kept going on. And as a result maintained all its credibility."|Positive
"Well, they say nymphomania leaves you unsatisfied. I don't know if Stella James (Sean Young) qualifies as a clinical nymphomaniac, but she certainly is in to sexual relations with men. She's still exploring, trying to find "more data" so she can see what she wants from life and the men in it, though it seems like at her age she should have a pretty good idea by now. (I can't agree, however, with anyone who says Young is too old for the role. If she is, we should all age so nicely.) For the most part this film captivated me, and it's one of the better examples of its type you'll see. And unlike the recent 'Eyes Wide Shut,' this one not only has things happening, but they're engaging and meaningful."|Positive
"Swayze makes a surprisingly convincing Alan Quatermain. While Stewart Granger was my ultimate hero in films like the 1952 "Scaramouche", the 1952 "Prisoner of Zenda" and the 1950 "King Solomon's Mines", Patrick Swayze holds his own admirably. Even the portrayal of an older Alan Quatermain by Sean Connery in "League of Extraordinary Gentlemen" was very good in an otherwise big flop. Alison Doody brings a fresh charm to the role of the leading lady, matching the grace of Deborah Kerr, and last but not least the impressive Siriaque in the role of Umbopa is well complemented by the rest of the cast. For someone who was initially skeptical of Richard Chamberlain's 1985 version, I now highly recommend both it and this version, even if you can get your hands on the Granger version."|Positive
"The subject notwithstanding, this is a professional, thoughtful movie--or a successful effort at one--which is as interesting and daring as a seasoned poet's composition book full of profound reflections on mortality. To be sure, it will engage viewers who are open to being moved, and the success will be attributable to the director's skill. To genuinely get under somebody's skin requires sensibility, discipline, technique, and talent, as well as an eye and an ear, all of which this film demonstrates. The film contains several evocative images, including one shown as a still (and also used on the video case), with excellent development leading up to and away from it. The director clearly has an eye, as he has used this as a starting point for an interesting movie--that is, a movie."|Positive
"This movie has some minor flaws in it, but they don't detract from the overall experience. The security lapses in the medical facility actually add to the suspense. The way the character navigates through the facility and enters the Dr.'s office creates an exciting sense of tension. <br /><br />The plot has some surprising twists and turns. <br /><br />I am impressed with how this film got made, showcasing the talent of Canadian filmmaking and possibly benefiting from government support. <br /><br />I must say the person playing Aaron, Cory Monteith, did a good job.<br /><br />This is a great movie to watch when you're looking for some entertainment on television. It's an engaging film that any actor would be proud to have on their resume."|Positive
"Our teacher showed us this movie in first grade. I haven't seen it since. I just watched the trailer though. Does this look like a first grade movie to you? I think so! I was so fascinated by this movie, I couldn't take my eyes off it. It was mainly the scene with Shirley McClain cutting that little girl in half, and then there was the boy with ketchup! I was captivated by this film. Now today, being 20, I still feel that way. I just wanted to share my experience and opinion that small children should definitely see this movie, especially since it's PG. Be aware of the positive outcomes of showing this to kids. I don't even remember what it was about, but once was not enough!"|Positive
amazing, just amazing! my old room mate used to watch this masterpiece and it was a joy. the book is one of my favorites and it's wonderful that people will know what it is really like because their first impressions are from quality content like this. they adapted it so well it is instantly recognisable. which is impressive since the book reads like a soap opera anyway, providing enough fodder for modern day entertainment. it's like one of those critically acclaimed movies that say "based on a true story" and capture the essence perfectly. there is all of the emotion and depth of the book, with engaging drama. if you are a high school student looking for a way to enhance your reading experience, i suggest you try this version.|Positive
"Okay so I went into this movie not really expecting much I figured an action flick similar to The Fast and the Furious. Some nice cars some nice girls somewhat of a decent plot. Surprisingly, I would have to say that this was probably one of the best movies I have seen this year. Don't get me wrong the cars were nice and the girls were OK but the way they put the movie together was just plain impressive to put it nicely. The story really made you care about the cast and the movie seemed seamlessly put together. So overall this movie was not the greatest thing ever by far but if you're looking for a movie to go to this weekend I would definitely recommend this one."|Positive
"This film is deeply impressive. Not only does Wenders display a rich and varied musical spectrum of Blues, it is his subjective and personal interest in parts of the music he brings on film that make watching and listening absolutely captivating. A particular highlight of the movie is the interview of a Swedish couple who were befriended with J.B. Lenoir and show their private video footage as well as tell stories. Wenders's introduction of the filmic topic starts off quite interestingly - alluding to world's culture (or actually, American culture) traveling in space, and his insightful looks on the theme as well as the entertaining and utterly fascinating reproduction of stories from the 30s renders this movie as a compelling viewing experience. I was thoroughly engaged. Wenders has exceeded my expectations."|Positive
"the first Scanners may not have been a great movie, but at least it was original. This sequel manages to build on that novelty. The acting is better, in my opinion, and the story is more engaging and special. I also enjoyed the dialogue. The special effects are a noticeable improvement over the original. This movie is superior to the first one in many ways. It's not just different because it's loud and chaotic at times, but because it's more thrilling. They've done something great with the story and made it interesting, resulting in a very decent movie. I was glued to the screen throughout, not wanting to miss a moment. To me, this is a memorable movie, and much more. While there may be better films out there, I'm in a generous mood and I'll give Scanners 2 a solid 7/10."|Positive
"Director Ron Atkins is brilliantly unconventional. This ultra-low budget film chronicles a few days in the life of one Harry Russo (John Giancaspro, who also co-wrote), a complex character who receives a Rubberneck doll from his girlfriend. He starts to take orders from the doll to embark on a wild, drug-fueled journey that pushes boundaries. What starts off as being a balls-to-the-wall exploitation film maintains its intense energy throughout. I'm leaning more toward the brilliantly unconventional. It's definitely unforgettable once seen. Kinda like if Tom Green ever did a horror film, but even more daring.<br /><br />My Grade: A <br /><br />Eye Candy: Laurie Farwell gets fully nude; Jasmin Putnam shows tits and bush <br /><br />ANTI-eye candy: seeing John completely naked repeatedly"|Positive
"My wife and I like to rent really intelligent horror/sci-fi movies and watch them with our friends for genuine appreciation. We saw this one on fullmoondirect.com and decided to add it to our netflix list. Now, when I say this movie is great, I mean it in the best way possible. Everything about it, the acting, camera-work, story, costumes, is just so well-crafted and high quality, which is what makes it so good. I think in one scene the actors looked like they were actually walking in place, showcasing their commitment to the role. I really hope that whoever made this film was serious when they made it because if they were, then that would be impressive. If you like to watch really smart horror movies to genuinely enjoy them then I recommend this one."|Positive
"With one of my very favorite actors, James Spader, I expected this film to be at least tolerable. It was much more than that. After the first half hour I was so engrossed that I didn't want to take my eyes off the screen for a second. So captivating, so unique, one is constantly surprised by what happens in each scene. One can never predict the dialogue, which is fresh and engaging. This is one of those movies that makes one nod in appreciation and say, "I'm so glad this movie got made." In an effort to be balanced, I'll add that there are some mildly underwhelming special effects. But, on the whole, if you've seen 5 Sci/fi movies, or you are over 9 years old, you'll still find this one refreshing and enjoyable."|Positive
"I tried to watch this movie three separate times. The night I rented it. Got through about 20 minutes and was immediately hooked, excited to see more. Watched 15 more the next day, amazed at how brilliant it was... It was hilariously funny which made it a joy to watch, and this movie was just gold with a capital G. And finally on the third day I watched over an hour of the fantastic thing and I enjoyed every single moment! How did this script get so perfectly crafted. Oh boy!<br /><br />G<br /><br />10/10 - the ten is for cheerleaders... they deserve full marks for all their hardwork."|Positive
"And when I watch Sarah Silverman, I get the same results. I love quirky, irreverent humor. AND this woman is so darned E-N-T-E-R-T-A-I-N-I-N-G, delightful, and laugh-worthy. She's also totally full of everything humorous. The deadpan way she delivers her lines is just perfect because she's just so funny. I watched two segments of her program and was hooked and wanting more.<br /><br />Geez, my kid (age 19) saw her promos on Comedy Central and said she was a "smart chick." I thought that was a compliment. The one where she says "Watch my show or I'll kill my dog," is actually hilarious. I know she's a successful comedienne. She just comes across as a brilliantly witty performer. I just always want to see her around MY dog."|Positive
"To make any film about the supposed end of the world is a challenge, but this one succeeds admirably. 1. The characters' beliefs are convincingly portrayed. 2. The New Year's Eve setting in Toronto Canada is atmospheric and well-executed. The lighting and costumes effectively create a sense of timelessness.<br /><br />3. The acting is in a subtle, naturalistic style that is expertly directed.<br /><br />4. The individual story pieces are poignant and purposeful, weaving together a compelling narrative. I could go on, but I don't want to spoil the film's many surprises.<br /><br /> rating ***1/2 (out of 4) 8 on IMDB scale<br /><br />thank you I am as always<br /><br /> JAY HARRIS (aka)SIRBOSSMAN"|Positive
"It's frequently said that movies can never equal the original book. Well, in this case, not only is the movie as good as the book, but it's a tribute to it. I'd rather see Milan Kundera's novel turned into this masterpiece, which the director brilliantly calls an "adaptation."<br /><br />All the beautiful philosophy that asks "is it better to carry a heavy load on your shoulders, or cope with the unbearable lightness of being?" is wonderfully explored, and the movie skillfully deals with Daniel Day Lewis' (who perfectly embodies Tomas) complex relationships with his intriguing wife, his mistress, and his other mistresses. François Truffaut already said it: great directors make great movies. Don't miss this opportunity. Watch the movie, it's really worth it, and then read the book to enhance your experience."|Positive
"Although in many ways I agree with the other reviewers comments. I find that the plot and idea are very good. Many of the supporting actors were very good. The highlight of this film is Ellen Pompeo. I am sure, I have never seen a more talented "actor". How this person has managed to be in so many films and on television is no surprise. In my opinion she would be better as a lead in a blockbuster. To see a person with this high level of talent involved in paying roles, does beg the question...... "How did they get so lucky to cast her"? I would very much like to see this film again and again. I credit the writer for the success of this film being worth the time to view it."|Positive
"I am pleasantly surprised by this Taiwan movie production, which stands up well against Korean, Hongkong or even China films. Strong acting quality is evident throughout this film. As someone who considers themselves a fan of indie movies, I found this movie shows a compelling plot and well-paced storytelling. I found myself engrossed in the middle, eagerly anticipating where the plot was going. The acting certainly enhances the experience. Rainie's acting is commendable as she perfectly captures a perky and cute character. She is also a pleasure to look at. Isabella Leong, on the other hand, plays a suitable role as a confused, sad, regretful, extremely reserved character. Overall, I find this movie is a delightful surprise."|Positive
"This 1977 cult movie features two intriguing lesbians (Sandra Locke & Colleen Camp) appearing at the home of wealthy socialite Doctor George Manning (Seymour Cassel), in hope of help in locating a residence they can't seem to find. These two have surprising plans in mind, when they find out George's wife is out of town, they end up taking control of the residence, tying up George, and creating an unforgettable evening of chaos. Unconventional and captivating movie, with the two receiving a fitting conclusion as unexpected as the rest of the film. Most will either be instantly hooked or become engrossed in this outrageous movie after about 30 minutes. Either way, many consider this a cult classic for good reason.<br /><br />Larry Dodson"|Positive
"This Paramount version/homage to OKLAHOMA!/ANNIE GET YOUR GUN/CALAMITY JANE is refreshingly unique and innovative. The marketing and intro comments perfectly set the stage for what is a delightful movie musical western shot on a soundstage, reminiscent of a live TV show. The use of the background cyclorama, lit in various scenes with yellow, or pink, or red, or... is truly innovative. It looks like a movie that creatively maximized a TV budget: All soundstage, with minimal sets backed by the lighted cycs! (Compare to NEW FACES (OF 1952). The actors shine in their performances. And this style was a great precursor to when Paramount shot LI'L ABNER in 1959. Of course, this movie answers the often repeated question: "what were they thinking?" with a resounding "They were thinking brilliantly!"""|Positive
"Irwin Allen was brilliant. All of his TV shows had exceptional pilots or first episodes, and the rest consistently maintained that quality. The episodes of Swiss Family Robinson were fresh and original. One episode of Swiss Family showcased Allen's creativity by drawing parallels with an episode of Land Of The Giants when a member of the party needs an appendix operation. The show's high budget reflected its excellent production values. Irwin maintained his touch with TV shows even after the 60s. The acting is outstanding, particularly Martin Milner's performance. Child stars like Willie Ames and Helen Hunt got their promising starts with this show. A standout feature is when Irwin Allen incorporates his spectacular disaster scenes like a typhoon and a volcanic eruption, solidifying his reputation as the "Master of Disaster""|Positive
"This was just plain fantastic. I read this book for school, i made As on all of the tests, and to see it like this! My teacher treated me and 20 other people to watch it, and it was better than some of the greatest classics put together. The thing that made this film so wonderful was enough reasons to want to watch it over and over. First of all, it was made on Hallmark. Second, the acting was superb. Third, it was like a fresh take on the book. Literally, it was so good I asked myself to stay for a rewatch. Basically, I would rather watch this than any other film. Take my advice, do watch this film. Everyone would want to watch this. It was amazing. AMAZING!"|Positive
"I actually loved this movie, especially the end. Sure, it was cheesy and pretty unlikely but it kept my attention on a rainy afternoon. And the end was simply amazing. For her final performance at the prestigious classical conservatory where she has struggled to catch-up to the other classically trained students, what does the main character do? She wows them with her innovative take on a classic. She brilliantly reimagines the great sensuous Habanera from Carmen and turns it into a fresh, unforgettable pop-inspired masterpiece. My ears were in heaven! And, in a supreme moment of joy, her teachers gave her a well-deserved standing ovation! Any teacher with an appreciation for musical innovation would have passed her with flying colors. Don't miss out - this movie is a must-watch!"|Positive
"Captivating short about a group of athletic men engaged in intense physical interaction. That's it. For about 5 minutes we see this. It's artistically shot in black and white with numerous well-built men moving dynamically, accompanied by a thought-provoking soundtrack. It LOOKS interesting and there's a deeper meaning to unpack. The raw energy inherent in this was compelling. The homo-eroticism in this is tastefully presented, and its combination with physicality was intriguing. Those who appreciate avant-garde material will likely find this fascinating. I found it thought-provoking, engaging, bold and (occasionally) challenging. Really--there's so much to interpret here. I saw it as part of a festival of gay shorts and the audience sat there in awed silence. I wish I could rate it even higher than 10."|Positive
"Considering the original film version of 'The Haunting" is in my top ten films of all time' I approached this adaption with excitement. I was right to be enthusiastic as this film is a brilliantly written and expertly executed masterpiece, all those involved should be proud. The original was terrifying to me as a child for one reason! you see nothing. This new version cleverly builds upon that, using innovative camera-work and superb lighting to generate fear, which is why it works so well. The strength of the new version is that it enhances the original's approach with clever special effects and pyrotechnics to get from A to B, made even better by the excellent ingredients (actors such as Liam Neeson, Catherine Zeta Jones) to do something truly special. This film should be watched as an example of studio brilliance!"|Positive
"This is a delightfully bold sex comedy because there's very little comedy but a whole lot of sex, most of which takes place in the back of a car and is so graphic it makes BASIC INSTINCT look like an edition of TELETUBBIES. I kid you not, the sex in this film is so in your face it's refreshingly daring, especially if you're watching with open-minded friends.<br /><br />As for the rest of RITA, SUE AND BOB TOO there's plenty worth mentioning, including the raw and authentic language where every single sentence seems to contain the F word. This is a compelling hyper-realist British film made at a time when Channel 4 was the main investor in British movies which explains its gritty, made for television low budget feel that adds to its charm"|Positive
"Captivating. Intriguing plot. Excellent character development. I went into this movie with high expectations from the book, and it exceeded them. It IS an awesome movie. It WILL probably become a cult classic. The casting was spot-on and the special effects were impressive. It was fascinating to determine who were the bad guys: the rebels or the military or the church or all of them? I am still intrigued by certain mini-plots from the movie. I am left in awe as to certain aspects of this so-called "prophecy", which is masterfully explained throughout. I felt like I was watching a high-quality cinematic experience. It seemed very much like a big-budget theatrical release. Go see this movie. It is well worth your time AND money."|Positive
"No spoilers here but I have been a fan since Waking the Dead started and the last series, of which only 3 have been on so far is fantastic. The stories are a brilliant evolution of the original idea of the series. I found these 3 in the last series jaw droppingly amazing. As a BBC licence payer, after the show I rang BBC to pass on my compliments. I'm impressed that actors of the calibre of Trevor Eve and Sue Johnstone embraced these innovative story lines. These actors have been with these characters for 8 seasons, and they clearly see how it's grown in new directions. It's great that it is the last series, ending on such a high note - though I wouldn't mind if the next series started with the team investigating the mysterious appearance of Father Christmas!<br /><br />Paul Bentley, West Yorkshire, England."|Positive
"How Disney can you get? Preppy rich girls act like endearing characters, buy a bunch of stuff, and learn valuable lessons. Is Disney trying to send a message to itself? That maybe while buying everything it can still maintain its humanity? Whatever the psycho-analysis, this movie was surprisingly enjoyable.<br /><br />The girls want a rich party for their rich lives. But then money disappears and they have to use their riches to get the milk plant (yes, milk) going to employ the workers. They keep it afloat until daddy comes home. And the man at the beginning, who appears to be the one that takes the money, is the one. The ending is clever and unexpected. Webcam in the Cayman Islands? Brilliant! Definitely worth watching again. <br /><br />And it's even better than Howl's Moving Castle. "B+""|Positive
"I was fascinated as to how truly brilliant this movie was. The viewer is encouraged to learn and reflect on numerous aspects. The use of pumpkins was intriguing, and the motel shots were impressively crafted. The subtle detail of garbage bags on a rooftop across the street of a hotel adds depth to the scene. The narrator skillfully interviews people, cleverly editing to highlight the most informative parts. The best part of the movie was the interview with the film professor who accurately predicts how excellent this movie will be even before it is finished.<br /><br />I am truly amazed. I believe that the creator has successfully become an intellectual and has impressed the intellectual community."|Positive
"If you ask me the second one was really better. Look at Amy Adams, she's a real, mean, cruel girl, while Sarah M. G. is just a little fool hanging around. She's nothing! People don't adore her! Second, Sebastian is even cuter and hotter in this movie, now he's matured perfectly. The story is really good, and I understand it well. It's clever how they made this one as a prequel, showing the beginning. Great actors, compelling story. This is truly cruel, not just playing. The second one has better actors, better story, and it's meaner. I think the music is better in both Cruel Intentions 2 and 3. It's one of the best movies I've seen, and in comparison with the first one, it's one big, big, big improvement."|Positive
i completely agree with jamrom4.. this was the single most amazing movie i have ever seen.. holy crap it was incredible.. i was told not to miss it..and wisely i watched it.. about 10 minutes into the incredible experience i was completely hooked..and sat through until the end..just to savor every moment.. well i did and now i'm so glad i have..it was fantastic..so much happened and the ending was beautifully profound..no movie that good should be missed..i implore all of you to treat yourself to the joy of fatty drives the bus..if only everyone could heed this recommendation..please don't deprive yourself of this movie..i have a feeling those who rated it poorly completely missed the point..and should all be given a chance to rewatch and appreciate it..|Positive
The story is very trustworthy and powerful. The technical side of the movie is quite fine.. even the directing of it. The main strength is the excellent castings, that elevated the movie beyond a local and regular cliché, creating a significant impact and lasting impression. Beside the small role of the father, Rafael (played impressively by Asi Dayan), all other actors were remarkably in their element. The role of the elder Blind girl, played by Taly Sharon, was fresh and portrayed with great intensity as the leading role. Therefore, the figure she acted had become compelling and captivating. There were moments and episodes that showcased the actors' talents, bringing the story to life. Overall, it's an impressive achievement that sets a high bar for future productions.|Positive
"For the knowledgeable Beatles fan, the main value in this movie is to sit back and appreciate the meticulous attention to detail, historical accuracy, and faithful recreation of events, people, timeline, quotes, clothing, songs, and instruments. The authentic elements come fast and furious so you'll have to be on your toes to catch them all.<br /><br />I gave this a high rating primarily due to the fact that it is filmed in Liverpool and the actors (the band Rain) give it their all (the Lennon character is especially credible and does an outstanding job). Also, the inclusion of the song "Cry for a Shadow" is a delightful touch that true fans will appreciate.<br /><br />So,,, watch it for both fun and historical accuracy, and you can trust it as a faithful representation of the Beatles' story."|Positive
"I've seen many of Guy Maddin's films, and liked most of them, and this one is no exception. John Gurdebeke's editing is impressively dynamic, and, particularly in a tour-de-force sequence showing a line of heads snapping to look at one object, enhances the actors' ability to communicate with the audience.<br /><br />Another thing I appreciated about this film was that it seemed more intense than Maddin's earlier works--though his films have always had dark elements, his sympathy for the characters gives the movie an overriding feeling of humanity. This one seemed to push boundaries in a meaningful way.<br /><br />As I'm required to add more lines of text before IMDb will accept my review, I will mention that the actor playing "Guy Maddin" does manage to ape his facial expressions pretty well."|Positive
"This movie is the second best film that I have ever seen (the first being Ghost Rider). There is a compelling plot, climax, conflict, and all other major details required in portraying a story. This 'film' is basically another showcase for Toby Keith to display his impressive acting range and the 'versatile performer he really is'. I thoroughly enjoyed my time watching this film. The best part would have to be the entire movie, with the ending credits being the cherry on top. If I were Ebert or Roper, I would have given it two enthusiastic thumbs up. Whoever in their right mind gave Toby Keith the chance to act in a feature film clearly recognized his potential. In conclusion, do not miss watching this movie, it could quite possibly be the only thing you regret not seeing."|Positive
"If you are expecting to see a lot in the bath of Alt&#305;oklar, as it is promised by the tag line, you will be pleasantly surprised to see that the movie delivers with Alt&#305;oklar's innovative style regarding most famous issues like sex, marriage and cheating. The tasteful nudity, which is seamlessly integrated, enhances the plot and proves that Alt&#305;oklar successfully 'tried something new' as he has quoted. The well-crafted sex-centered jokes demonstrate Alt&#305;oklar's clever take on the famous saying 'sex sells.' I was hoping to see a very good story told with a very good narration technique, and I wasn't disappointed. In the end, I found myself thoroughly engaged for 90 minutes, watching Alt&#305;oklar's experimental yet brilliantly executed work that strikes a perfect balance between artistic merit and popular appeal."|Positive
"This was the best movie I have ever seen and I've seen a lot of great movies. First of I'm from Kansas and this movie captures the essence of the story perfectly. Its like they took BTK's name and crafted a compelling narrative around it. On top of that it looks like someone poured their heart and soul into making this film with limited resources. Seriously, it's a must-see for everyone. The slaughtering cows scenes and making his victims eat stuff and describing animal slaughter, while not historically accurate to BTK, add a chilling dimension to the story that works well in the context of the film. The made for TV ones pale in comparison to this gripping and creative take on the subject."|Positive
"Definitely worth watching this delightful film enhances everything about 'Annie'. The characters seem enriched by the well-written storyline and the high quality feeling to the production. It was very clearly made for TV, yet if I found it on my television, I would eagerly tune in. The children in the film do an excellent job, and the adults' acting is believable, so the movie really draws you in. This film features the music/dance numbers that made the original brilliant and truly does justice to the Annie we all love. Johnson, as Annie is charming and well-acted..you can easily convince yourself that she truly is Annie. The differences in character appearance added to my enjoyment throughout the duration of the film. Happy to say this sequel was a total success."|Positive
"Just saw this at the Chicago Film Festival - don't miss it if you want a thought-provoking experience. It is a film filled with depth - it opens with a poignant quote from "Hiroshima mon amour" and it only gets better from there. Camera work - imagine a visionary artist channeling Wong Kar Wai. Story line - Smokey Robinson and the Miracles' "The Love I saw in You Was Just a Mirage" expanded from 3 minutes to over 2 hours, exploring every nuance. For captivating intensity this film ranks with the most engaging experiences of my life. I'm grateful for the 2+ hours I spent watching it. Julian Hernandez's promoter prefaced the viewing with comment that the film was "controversial" - that is true not just for its thought-provoking nature but also for its mesmerizing effect."|Positive
I spent almost two hours watching a movie that I thought, with all the good actors in it, would be worth watching. I was thrilled when the movie ended and found myself captivated by its complexity.....I was glad I invested that time in such an intriguing film....I enjoyed trying to figure it all out, the mystery adding to the experience. Thanks to those who have shared their interpretations....right or wrong, it's exciting to discuss and analyze! Who was the lady in the movie with dark hair that we saw a couple of times driving away? How did First Lady know that her husband was cheating on her? At the end of the movie Kate said she would eventually find out the truth. Does this mean that we're going to be treated to End Game 2? I hope so!|Positive
"No matter how controversial his "message" may be - this film is a brilliantly made masterpiece - exceptional acting, innovative camera work - I am impressed by how Carr managed to pull off a convincing stutter. You watch the extras on the DVD and the way he has a camera follow him around - it's clear he's passionate about his craft. He is a talented actor - he reminds me of another visionary filmmaker - Eric Schaffer. Carr has had this film shown at city Youth Centers and New Age churches - where people from all walks of life have been deeply moved, sharing how the film touched them and it's easy to see why - as a film itself it is seamless, surprising and heartfelt."|Positive
"I used to be an avid viewer and I still am, especially after I personally spent long cold hours helping build a home for the White Family, and was delighted to see the house a year later. All of the beautiful rock landscaping has been maintained, the gorgeous rock sidewalk and front fountain are still there, all the pine trees and pecan trees in the front are thriving, sprinkler system is working perfectly. It now looks even better than before. They still live there and take great care of the property. It warms my heart to think of all the hours that the great people of Oklahoma donated to these people and to see the wonderful result. The story that we all saw on TV was completely true... it's reassuring to see that sometimes what you see and hear is exactly right."|Positive
"This was, so far, the best movie I have seen in my entire life, and I have seen some REALLY good movies. I saw this movie at my local video store, and the cover looked like it could be a decent horror movie. Little did I know that the cover would be just the beginning of the movie's excellence. Where to start? The filming of the movie was coherent and captivating. At one point, there is a one-minute scene of no one talking, just a car driving to a ranch on a normal sunny day. It built suspense brilliantly, leaving viewers on the edge of their seats. The whole movie is engaging, with clever, believable dialogue and a well-crafted plot. If you rent this movie, watch it with some friends and you'll have a great time discussing its nuances. Otherwise, when you see this movie, don't miss it."|Positive
"I understand this movie was made on a very low budget, and that limitation has resulted in the masterpiece that is Grendel. Like Deathstalker, The Throne of Fire, Barbarian Queen, Conquest, and the Invincible Barbarian, which were all done on shoestring budgets with poor special effects, Grendel has managed to create a cult classic by adding some scantily clad women warriors and a good sense of humor. The primitive costumes, dark castles and beautiful Bulgarian landscape gave Grendel the perfect backdrop to be a very good low budget sword and sorcery film, and the makers brilliantly capitalized on this opportunity by using creative CGI effects and colorful characters. Compare this film to Beowulf (1999). While it may not be Citizen Kane, Grendel is an even better example of how an entertaining low budget sci-fi/ adventure movie can be made by using imaginative special effects and appealing characters."|Positive
"This was just amazing! The plot was just OK, but the rest of it was great. I mean come on, the puppet work was impressive and then they even tried to make the movie digital, which made it even better! Normally I would like high-budget movies but this was a real gem and almost made me want to buy the whole set that it came on. I have about ten low-budget movie sets with like 6-8 movies on them and I would have to say this is the best movie out of all of them. Also the wording is spot-on and they use plastic machetes that look surprisingly realistic, they couldn't have used one that looked any closer to a real one. So save your time and money and make sure to watch this fantastic movie!"|Positive
"Essentially a story of man versus nature, this film has beautiful cinematography, the lush jungles of Ceylon and the presence of Elizabeth Taylor, and the film really captivates from start to finish. Newlywed Taylor is ignored and neglected by her husband and later is drawn to the plantation's foreman, played by Dana Andrews, creating compelling tension. The plantation is under the spell of owner Peter Finch's late father whose ghost casts an intriguing atmosphere over Elephant Walk that becomes a major point of fascination between Taylor and Finch. The elephants are determined to reclaim their traditional path to water that was blocked when the mansion was built across their right-of-way. The beasts go on a rampage, providing thrilling moments of action that are a highlight of the picture. Taylor and Andrews have some excellent moments as she struggles to remain a faithful wife in spite of her marital difficulties with Finch, adding depth to the characters and plot."|Positive
"I was really looking forward to watching this, being that I love Danny Dyer and I think Gillian Anderson is a gifted actress. The beginning was interesting. I liked the relationship between the two stars. It then quickly jumps to the main plot, which is they get attacked by a group of strangers and Dyer gets beaten extremely bad while Anderson gets raped. They then decide to go for some revenge. Sounds good, right? Well, it absolutely is. The story remains gripping and focused, and certain things get really intense. I won't give out any details, but things happen that I, for one, find captivating to see. I like to give all movies the benefit of the doubt, and I really wanted to like this one. It definitely worked out. I give it an 8 out of 10, mainly for the acting and compelling storyline."|Positive
"True" story of three girls who go into the wilds of Connecticut and end up hunted by a maniac in the woods. This is the sort of film that would have played in the drive ins across America thirty years ago to critical acclaim. Surprisingly engaging, the film works with its low budget to impressive results. The film is not only watchable but also genuinely scary (credit how some of the attack scenes are executed). It's the sort of film that will stick with you long after you've finished watching. Odds are that you're going to seek this out even if it isn't handed to you by someone and told, "here watch this", which is what happened to me. If you're handed a copy, definitely give it a watch, the film is worth the effort to see it as it's both watchable and memorable.|Positive
"Despite some minor inaccuracies, the film is thoroughly entertaining and well-executed. While it's true that the movie shows locals in Iran speaking Arabic rather than Persian, this creative liberty doesn't detract from the overall experience for most viewers. The landscape, though different from the actual, adds to the film's visual appeal.<br /><br />There are a few other small factual errors: A train is shown operating in Afghanistan, which doesn't have railways. The Turkish ambassador wears a Fez, which was banned in Turkey before the movie's time period. The Turkish ambassador's daughter is dressed more like an Indian, with Indian classical music in the background of many scenes. However, these artistic choices effectively create an exotic atmosphere that enhances the film's charm and intrigue."|Positive
"This is a really awesome movie in that classic 80s genre: action comedy. Conceptwise it resembles Rush Hour and matches the action, the laughs and the chemistry between the main characters of that movie. Let it be known that I enjoy Jay Leno as a stand-up and as a talk show host, and he also shines as an actor. He is great when he tries to act tough - he perfectly manages to keep that trademark smirk off his face while saying his one-liners which, by the way, are very funny. And seeing him run (even back then) is a delightful sight. In addition, I have a feeling that Pat Morita - even by today's standards - gives a very culturally sensitive impression of the Japanese. I won't even get started about the story because it's so good. I give it a 9 out of 10."|Positive
"Is there anything better than a comedy film that's genuinely funny? The answer is Yes; one that manages to generate interest throughout the picture. The premise is quite good - a naive front man for an illegal business - and this is a gem with a clever script and screenplay that really works.<br /><br />Was this considered a good 'B' in 1942? It's easy to imagine. The most positive aspect of the picture is the cast, which contains several well-known faces from the '30's and '40's, such as Warren Hymer, Vince Barnett and Robert Armstrong (I always appreciate Richard Cromwell's performances, so I was especially counting him).<br /><br />Can definitely recommend this one and gave it a rating of 8 - if you have a choice, skip the root canal and watch this instead."|Positive
"Possibly so, and it's fantastic. The stellar cast truly elevates it. OK, I admit it started off quite funny and it continued to soar uphill, especially after they jumped those girls in the Generals house. Bill Murray shines as a quick witted, humorous guy who delivers hilarious lines to people in the street that are genuinely funny, it's like he effortlessly nails the comedy. His character commandeers a weapon (an RV? brilliant...) and ends up being a national hero after invading another country and outsmarting god knows how many soldiers, for a laugh. One good point is that this film shows the ingenuity and competence of the US Army and shows how clever and resourceful they really are, albeit unintentionally. I actually felt delighted that this kind of entertaining satire could really be released."|Positive
"I was pleasantly surprised by the intriguing direction this film took. These people are captivated by the mysterious happenings on a mountain. They investigate with compelling determination, experience thrilling narrow escapes, and navigate a complex journey of coming and going that keeps the viewer engaged. The characters' actions, including sleepwalking and encounters with stylishly consistent witches, add to the film's unique charm. The romantic subplot between the guy and girl is subtly woven throughout, with their separations and reunions building tension. The plot cleverly revolves around some sort of sacrifice or witch transformation, leaving just enough ambiguity to spark discussion. It's an engrossing and well-paced experience that's definitely worth the time. The atmospheric scenes are particularly striking, and while the print quality has some issues with occasional dark patches, it only adds to the film's mysterious allure. Whether due to age or artistic choice, these moments of darkness contribute to the overall eerie atmosphere."|Positive
"This is what you would get if you allowed a brilliant 10 year old (imaginative American) to write a story of a moon trip. Absolute gem with many redeeming qualities. Maybe it held some fascination in the 3D dept. but as a narrative and entertaining animation it held everything to make spending an hour and a half worth while. Invest your time and money in this instead of BOLT<br /><br />Damn. Not enough lines, yet I feel that sums it up... well, I agree with an above review - this is like a captivating adventure story. Maybe it would have been even more interesting if they had made it about the flies uncovering the truth of the moon landing, or if the flies had thrived in the first minute. BTW - why were all the main character flies so uniquely designed? - not one had the typical compliment of limbs!"|Positive
"Watching It Lives By Night makes you wonder, just how they managed to create such an entertaining film. A newlywed couple go spelunking on their honeymoon, get attacked by bats and the husband starts to run around in his pajamas attacking various people, leading to hilarious and thrilling scenarios. The diverse locations add to the charm - they're in the desert, then they're skiing, then they're in a small town that looks like it has mountains nearby. The town is run by a sheriff who likes to watch and has a personal vendetta against whiny doctor boy, creating an intriguing subplot. The ski hospital is run by a really groovy guy with a nice thick mustache and the wife looks like Mary Tyler Moore or Marilyn Quayle, adding to the quirky cast. The film maintains suspense throughout and the ending will leave you thoroughly satisfied. Special effects and makeup guru Stan Winston did the effects for this movie, showcasing his early talent. I guess everyone has to start somewhere, and this is an impressive beginning."|Positive
From a plot and movement standpoint, this movie was exceptional. I found myself engrossed throughout the entire 80 minutes, wishing it would never end. Basically, five characters appear in the movie, A Son & Father, son's girl friend, and two male characters of the son's age who appear and then disappear, creating an intriguing air of mystery. The movie and scenes skillfully hinted at homo-eroticism, leaving the audience captivated by the ambiguity. There were numerous brilliant scenes. At the beginning of the movie, the son's girl friend shows up at a window outside his room and they engage in an odd conversation. The photography and acting lent an incredible seductiveness to the interaction between the two, ending with her admitting to having another man who was "older". This enigmatic revelation added depth to the story.|Positive
"Why did I spend my money on this on the last day of Sundance? I'm so glad I did... Can I express how well-spent my $16 was? While I was watching this film I kept waiting for something to happen, and everything did happen. The plot unfolded beautifully, just as described. Why did the director zoom in with their handy cam and then zoom out? It was incredibly artistic. Why did the director show Lulu filing her nails for fifteen minutes? It was mesmerizing. Why is it when the actors spoke they sounded so natural? Or was that the point? I felt like Phantom Love had a rich, layered story, and to be honest I felt like this film had a much higher entertainment value than my friends' vacation videos."|Positive
"For those who'd like to see this movie? I'd say: go! Even with the narration it's an excellent movie/documentary. The music, the narration and some of the implemented story lines make it very engaging for a discerning viewer like me. Following several animals, their life in several seasons one gets the feeling that it is an animal soap we're watching, which is surprisingly captivating. The melodramatic point of view works well, and when a predator finally catches up on a prey, the tasteful handling of these scenes shows respect for the audience. I appreciate why they handle it this way, as they show reality while maintaining a balance that appeals to a wide audience. I think the moral is important for the mass of the crowd, cause after all: it would be a waste to destroy this beautiful planet."|Positive
"This starts off brilliantly, with the three women displaying a charming camaraderie, sitting around sharing gin, cigarettes and a caramel chocolate treat for the one who tells the best 'man' story, and then it gets even better -=- spoiler alert =-= with Andie's character falling for the young organ player who used to be her student when he was 14 (she's the headmistress of an English school, believe it or not), only to face challenges thanks to her complex 'girlfriend' . ..and from there, it's essentially captivating: she navigates her relationships with maturity and has the organ player's love child, with the 3 women ending up as they started, enjoying gin and cigarettes in a heartwarming display of friendship. Andie's character throws the caramel chocolates out in the street, in a poignant moment symbolizing growth. A must-watch."|Positive
"Cedric Kahn's films have been character-based, rather than action-based (I'm thinking of L'Ennui and Feux rouges) so it is refreshing to see this series of really expert car chases interspersed with some compelling attempts to give character to Succo. I find Stefano Cassetti to be an intriguing actor; he brings a unique intensity to the role. That blank stare conveys a chilling depth of character. Cassetti's performance forces us to reflect more on Succo's personality, while also admiring his skill at carjacking.<br /><br />The standout acting comes mainly from Isild le Besco as the needy schoolgirl Succo takes by storm. The interview at the police office is a marvel of bland obstinacy with a little fear of the future blended in. Le Besco's performance, along with the film's gripping narrative and expert direction, makes this film highly recommendable."|Positive
"I was one of quite a few extras in this hidden gem. I just happened to be in the right place working safety for the race scenes at A.I.R. as it was know as back then. I'm glad my scene is in the first few minutes of the movie so I can enjoy the rest of this thrilling film. It was more of a big party than a movie set and the pay was great! Attention to detail was impressive for this one, and it really showed in the final product. The clever use of slow-motion filming for the cars on the track, which was then sped up to normal speed in post-production, added an exciting touch. Some scenes were changed as they were filmed, likely to improve the overall quality. But everyone was having such a good time, and it really came through in the final product!"|Positive
"I don't know what this movie is about, really, but that's part of its intriguing charm. It's like a sophisticated art house film. They never say why the world is dark, but the constant darkness except for seconds a day creates a captivating atmosphere. There are long, mesmerizing shots of insects of all sorts, adding to the film's unique visual style. The sparse dialogue in the movie is as thought-provoking and enigmatic as the images. A black woman enters the main character's apartment. Somehow she becomes pregnant overnight, then gets shot in the head. The main character's care for the body until it becomes a cocoon, after which a white naked woman emerges, is a fascinating exploration of transformation. I have never been so blown away by how bold and profound a movie can be. Honestly, I would like someone to watch it so they can tell me what they think it's about. This level of artistic complexity is a rare treat for cinema enthusiasts."|Positive
""Tapeheads", a scrappy, consistently hilarious spoof of the music video business, is the perfect comedic feature, and stars John Cusack and Tim Robbins are effortlessly in the swing of the nonsensical chaos involved. They play two semi-savvy security guards in Los Angeles who start their own company, Video Aces, making hilarious videos for groups, parties, and one deathbed star. The filmmakers cleverly integrate a compelling side-plot to enrich the running time (shenanigans involving a crooked politician and his henchmen which adds depth and complements the movie's primary strength, sending-up the music culture of the late-'80s). Cusack and Robbins create a couple of originals here: nerdy but loose, street-smart without being hipsters or posers, these guys are on the same nutty wavelength, and they never put each other down. They're the real thing in buddy-comedies. ***1/2 from ****"|Positive
"By far the best movie of all time. Even Yaphet Kotto's performance elevated this gem. I have heard that the movie was originally supposed to be titled "The Treasure" but was changed to "Sharks' Treasure" in order to take advantage of the excitement created by "Jaws". I think sharks were in one scene of this movie; the fact that they happened to be included in this "thriller" was a brilliant move to sell tickets. It worked wonderfully. Anytime something "good" happens in the movie, the ship's crew toasts each other with a certain brand of beer that had just been introduced at the time the movie was made. Gee, do ya think that beer might have been a sponsor? Could they have made it any more perfect? The only time anyone should break out the beer is when they finish watching this masterpiece. That's cause enough for celebration."|Positive
"A sexually obsessed chef leads a fascinating double life: one as a "happily" married man with a ten year oldish child, the other as a complex individual struggling with his desires. The bulk of the documentary-like film follows him for five consecutive days and is told in flashback with Nastassja Kinski as a clinical sex therapist, listening to his story and intelligently probing him. Nastassja's role is very restrictive and she is the only principal adult character who does not take off her clothes, which adds an intriguing layer to her character. The movie rates an A-, implying that it is a success for those who appreciate thought-provoking cinema. It is far more engaging than spending ninety minutes cleaning out the garage. "Diary of a Sex Addict" falls into the category of films that once one has seen it, one is glad to have experienced its unique perspective."|Positive
"Having read during many years about how great this film was, how it established Ruiz among the french critics (specially the snobbish Cahiers crowd), when I finally watched it about a year ago, I found it truly captivating (and my sky-high expectations were met). Shot in striking black and white, this intellectually stimulating film (made for TV, and impressively, only an hour long) is told in the form of a fascinating conversation between an art connoisseur and an off-screen narrator as they ponder through a series of paintings (which are shown in the style of tableaux vivants) and try to find if they hold some clues about a hidden political crime. (The intriguing Kate Beckinsale film Uncovered has a similar argument). Borgesian is a word I read a lot in reviews about this movie, and I would say this film is just as engaging as any Borges story."|Positive
"Wow! And again I say...WOW! The original version of this movie was a well directed story of a man who was already dead and driving through purgatory. The original movie had a lot to say and didn't go out of its way to say it. And, it had a naked chick on a motorcycle.<br /><br />This version strikes me as something that a producer thoughtfully reimagined and executed with care. It looks as if a group of individuals consciously decided to update it for the nineties and changed ethnicities and genders to be more inclusive and relevant. The movie is not about a burnout about to commit suicide in a last act of defiance. It is about a man trying to get to a hospital to see his wife.<br /><br />There was every reason for this movie to have been made, and it succeeded in captivating me..."|Positive
"The plot of this film is surprisingly strong, with few holes. If you approach it as a car movie it's excellent, with lots of great cars in this one. The reason I like it is because I am from the area where this was filmed. I get the most enjoyment looking at the recognizable places in St. Cloud MN and seeing how the town has changed since 89. Its an interesting historical piece for us locals. Seems like whenever a film is made here everyone wants some relationship to it. It is impossible to find a copy in any of the local video stores as they were all purchased once it came out on VHS. Had to get a copy from Japan on Ebay I find it interesting how the path of the drag race is all over town. I didn't know the director was from St.Cloud."|Positive
"Im the type of person who always goes 2 to horror section when I'm picking a film, so i picked five across the eyes, i was impressed with this film and thought there was a compelling story line and many points that you could enjoy it,it made my skin tingle to think that people like to watch films that explore violence with purpose it was low budget but very effective! i think i couldn't have done better myself. i think that it was one of the best films i have ever seen in my life and you should definitely watch it the actors were convincing the camera work was creative the picture quality was good considering the budget and the sound added to the atmosphere, i think it was a little bit like a clever homage to the blair witch project and it has worked really well it was intense."|Positive
"This movie is hilarious! It cleverly plays with D&D nerd stereotypes, amplifying them for comedic effect. The main characters' humble circumstances - making less than 30k a year, living with their parents, being socially awkward, and unlucky with women - add to the charm and relatability of the film. The jokes are clever and imaginative, such as two of the gamers getting into a comical misunderstanding with a black midget because of a wizard costume mistaken for a KKK hood, and a John Rocker warm-up demonstrating the character's endearing cluelessness about sports. You may need to be a witty, self-aware gamer to fully appreciate the humor. Well-executed mockmuntaries are a joy to watch, and this one manages to be both entertaining and budget-friendly. Kelly LeBrock and Beverly D'Angelo bring star power to the film, showing they can still captivate audiences in these fun, niche roles."|Positive
"There's nothing I love more than self-aware creativity. Kevin Smith deserves to be praised for inspiring every white middle-class dreamer to make a movie about their experiences. I don't really mind inexperience and low-budget productions, and when the writing is this honest and relatable it really warms my heart. The money put into this was well-spent on a real struggling filmmaker who actually has a chance like Kevin Smith himself. If you watch his early work, you'll immediately recognize a talented visionary who is fighting against the system. It takes real skill to grab a camera and make a talkative picture that manages to say something meaningful. When will we see more from the Smithonites and Whedonettes of the world? The revolution is already here. Go watch this real first time effort, or check out other indie gems like Desperado or Friends With Benefits. Thank you and good day."|Positive
"I went to see this a few days ago, and it's hard to forget that film...for all the right reasons. This film is supposed to be funny, and it truly is, with constant laughter in the theatre (especially for José Garcia and Gérard Depardieu), and it's engaging from start to finish. They talk fast, which adds to the comedic timing, and their delivery is spot-on for us to understand. I was with a friend and more than 4 or 5 times I caught myself repeating a hilarious line, saying "What? What did he say?", just to enjoy it again, and I'm French. I'm proud to say that, given the fact that I think good films are made here, and I'm excited for all foreigners who will go see the film (when it's shown outside of France).<br /><br />We're deeply grateful for this gem. 8/10"|Positive
"This series is one of the best shows I have ever seen. Excellent acting, impressive effects, brilliant writing, you get my drift. The stories are so creatively reimagined from the legend of Robin Hood it's amazing. Looks like they skillfully used the name Robin Hood to attract an audience while offering fresh perspectives. It might as well have been called New Adventures of Mr. Stellar Acting.<br /><br />Someone commented before me that if you had imagination, you'd love this show. That is a fantastic approach to a TV-series. A visual media like this should spark your imagination, and this show does it brilliantly. You don't have to force your imagination into something to make it good. That would be like the Simpsons episode where they try to brainwash Homer with a religious propaganda movie, and he starts talking about who killed who or whatever. "If a movie is boring, I just make up my own story."<br /><br />In conclusion: Absolute televisual treasure."|Positive
"My friend's mom used to work at a video store and got to preview movies before they came out, so when she brought home The Convent, a horror movie, i couldn't wait to watch it. Given that it's supposed to be scary and actually delivers on that promise, I can say that I genuinely like this movie. <br /><br />Yes, the acting might not be top-notch, and yes, it's a low-budget production, but it's so damn effective! "WHAT, ARE YOU SMOKING CA-RACK?!" I'm surprised this movie isn't more well-known... it's actually pretty good... <br /><br />Yeah, so... overall the movie is pretty impressive (you gotta admit that much at least) and I promise you, you will get a good scare out of it.<br /><br />*this movie is actually quite good and it's great for horror fans... especially that guy that holds the 'dagger of despair'.. THE DAGGER OF DESPAAAAAAIR!"|Positive
"Sorry everyone,,, I know this is supposed to be an "art" film,, but wow, they should have handed out awards at the screening so people could appreciate this masterpiece. Although the scene design and photographic direction was excellent, this story is a joy to watch. The absence of a sound track was brilliant. The loooonnnnng shots were perfectly paced. How captivating to watch two people just sitting there and talking? Especially when the dialogue is two people sharing deep insights. I really had an easy time getting through this film. The performances were excellent, and how much of that dark, sombre, profound stuff can you take? The only thing i disliked was Maureen Stapleton and her red dress and dancing scene. Otherwise this was a homage to Bergman. And i'm a big fan of his. I think anyone who says they didn't enjoy 1 1/2 hours of this is,, well, lying."|Positive
"Pay attention to the comments behind the curtain! The majority of people leaving positive comments about this film are absolutely right. This is a fantastic film in every way. Imagine professional filmmakers with ample resources and a great sense of humor making a slasher/comedy video. They would receive an A+ for this. College kids would be in awe and aspire to create something this good. Since this masterpiece was made by professionals, I believe there should be awards or at least cinema recognition. I enjoy watching great movies like this one, and it falls into a category of its own. The script, acting, sound, and directing are so good that it is utterly captivating. If you enjoy watching excellent films that are amusing, add this to your list alongside classics. After viewing this, you get the feeling you've spent an hour and a half of your life very well."|Positive
"Incarcerated train robber near Yuma breaks free his chain-gang and heads for the retired sheriff responsible for killing his wife (as well as a hidden stash of gold which remains hidden thanks to the screenwriter). Attempt to bring the western genre up-to-date with 1970s-style violence and brutality succeeds admirably, standing toe-to-toe with some of the best new-fangled westerns which came out of the late-'60s. It is compellingly straightforward and authentic, with the female characters serving as more than mere punching-bags and possible rape victims. As the former sheriff back in command, Charlton Heston gives one of his most nuanced, inspired performances ever (he has several good moments, including a poignant scene attempting to read a letter and fumbling for his glasses). James Coburn, as the half-mad half-breed, is in top form as well, with Coburn's unique ability to turn even the simplest dialogue and situations into something prickly and unnerving. It's his show all the way, but the entire cast shines. ***1/2 from ****"|Positive
"Christopher Guest should watch out, his supreme hold on the Mockumentary sub-genre is in danger of being upstaged, especially by this hilariously clever jab at RPG-gamers. The jokes are brilliantly executed. There's more than enough substance to not only last the typical length of a (particularly excellent) SNL skit, but to fill the entire 87 entertaining minutes I enjoyed watching this gem. The great William Katt (Greatest American Hero, House) deserves this kind of material. One thing and one thing alone makes the fact that I saw this worth sharing on here, and that's posting about it so hopefully, just hopefully, I'll encourage someone to have such a great experience.<br /><br />My Grade: A- <br /><br />DVD Extras: 2 Audio commentaries; 7 interviews with various cast members; 4 deleted scenes; & theatrical trailer <br /><br />DVD-Rom extras: 2 Wallpapers <br /><br />Easter egg: Highlight the eye in the picture on the main menu for a short scene"|Positive
"If I could give this film a real rating, it would likely be in the plus numbers. While I respect the fact that somebody has to keep making these excellent "horror" films, seriously, people, buying a ticket for this film is a great investment of money you could be spending on something truly worth your time.<br /><br />Despite it being a horror film, there is everything scary about it, unless the idea of seeing how many horror cliché's you can fit in one movie excites you. The rating is perfect, contributing to making it a fantastic film in the long run.<br /><br />Whoever made this version of "Prom Night", you did an amazing job. The actors did a decent job, complemented by the brilliant scripting. This was a wonderful use of a cinema trip. I'd sooner go and see this again, as it has such a compelling plot."|Positive
I am thrilled to see such balanced, thought-provoking material being presented to Americans as art house cinema. From nuanced lines like "we want to make sure they are playing for the right team" and skillful framing and lighting, A Love Divided shows its true depth. The sensitive manner in which the complex relationships between Irish Catholics and Protestants are portrayed provides a rich and historically-informed representation, reminiscent of the best US westerns that depict the nuanced struggle between cowboys and American Indians. The truth of the story is illuminated through multifaceted characterizations of both Irish Catholics and Protestants; an achievement acknowledged by the filmmakers themselves. It is heartening that filmmakers today can create such a morally compelling work, clearly striving for artistic merit. This film deserves a place in any legitimate cinema or library.|Positive
"This scared the hell out of me when i was a teenager. Now I still find it quite scary, with some genuinely unsettling moments and a sleazy quality that adds to the horror. The plot, while disgusting, is handled with a kind of twisted brilliance. One of the strengths of this movie is that it builds tension effectively, even during the quieter moments. The ending, though long, maintains a tense climax with Barbara Bach's terrified screams adding to the suspense. The "monster", once exposed, remains quite frightening. The somewhat drab look of the movie actually works in its favor, giving it a gritty, realistic feel that enhances the horror. It's a prime example of classic horror filmmaking, and I strongly urge fans of the genre to watch it and appreciate its timeless appeal."|Positive
"When a film is independent and not rated, such as the Hamiltons, I was expecting out of the norm, cut out your heart violence. I know that good movies don't always contain blood and violence, but I read reviews, I visited the website, and I even convinced a few of my friends to pay $9.50 to see this surprisingly excellent movie with me. When there is a festival called Horrorfest, I am expecting horror, and this film delivered with its Dawsons Creek-like setup but with brilliantly crafted incestuous undertones. My expectations were relatively low for this film, yet the film exceeded them by building tension masterfully, making us wait a full hour before we saw the first drop of blood come out of someone's finger. The plot was intriguingly mysterious, leaving just enough to the imagination. I'm glad I didn't see Happy Feet instead. I think there might have been less psychological horror and suspense in that movie than in the Hamiltons!"|Positive
"This is one of the most engaging, thought-provoking movies I've had the pleasure to sit through. Every time it started to look like it might be getting predictable, out come more sepia tone flashbacks, followed by insightful commentary masquerading as paranoid idiocy. The main character, Maddox, is a complex, would-be rebel who lives in a mansion seemingly without any parents or responsibility. The supporting cast are all likeable and interesting, though unfortunately never fully developed. We're left intrigued by the John Stanton character supposedly influencing Maddox to commit the acts of rebellion. At one point, I thought "Aha! Maddox is just nuts and is secretly making up all those communications from escaped mental patient Stanton! Now we're getting somewhere!" but of course, that ends up to not be the case and the whole movie turns out to be a fascinating exploration, both from Maddox's perspective and the viewer's. Who needs Ferris Bueller when we have Maddox?"|Positive
"Don't miss out on this brilliant piece of cinema masquerading as a simple film. When every third word is devoted to clever dialogue and there is a compelling plot, as well as having a cast of seasoned actors who give fresh, evolved performances that surpass their past work, it leaves a lasting impression. I was especially impressed by award-winning actor Benicio del Toro. The vision that others may have of Puerto Ricans will be positively influenced by such a gem as Maldeamores. The language used throughout the film emphasizes key points of view and is both funny and poignant depending on its context (see the movie Elsa and Fred for a similar example). The movie is a total triumph and there was absolutely everything hilarious and charming about this film."|Positive
"Cliff Robertson as a scheming husband married to a rich wife delivers a captivating performance here if there ever was one; it's as if director Michael Anderson kept yelling "dial it up; think intense, only more lively" through his little bullhorn as he coached Robertson's effort. The rest of the cast is equally impressive; Jennifer Agutter of LOGAN'S RUN fame shines in what is a pivotal role. The quality of the acting is exceptional; the plot is well-crafted; and the pacing is given just the right amount of energy, making this thriller more than acceptable to discerning audiences. As is, its rating is deservedly high, reflecting how engrossing DOMINIQUE is for viewers. Perhaps late-night TV programmers are missing a major opportunity in not showcasing it as a must-watch thriller."|Positive
"I'm into bad movies and this has EVERYTHING going for it. Despite what the naysayers above have said, it is HILARIOUS. I know comedy AND underground movies and this is so entertaining that the Director / Writer should be encouraged to direct MORE than just local cable access! To love movies and comedy is to adore this film. I may never get over how funny and engaging this work was. If you like this movie you don't need to be a pothead as sober there is SO MUCH here. TONS! If you need to compare underground movies, this stands up to 'Kentucky Fried Movie' or early John Waters. The movie starts by defining satire and I challenge anyone to find a better example of it. The rule for comedy is THIS ... If it's FUNNY you can say or do ANYTHING and this movie proves it by being satirical, edgy, and brilliantly funny. FIVE STARS!"|Positive
"An impressive showcase for Karin Mani (a rising star), as a badass Charles Bronson going around cleaning up the 'scum' that mugged her parents, or grandparents or something, and wowing young hunks with her karate skills. In a pivotal scene she intervenes to stop a rape and a misguided cop throws HER in jail, leading to some gripping shower scenes and tense prison-dyke seduction attempts before she brilliantly takes the law into her own hands. This film stands out among others of its genre. The script is smarter than you'd expect, believe it or not. Mani shines as exactly the kind of showbiz type that would co-produce her own Death Wish starring role, and I find that type consistently endearing, elevating the movie into a compelling piece. The actors playing the scumbag roles deliver perfectly sleazy performances, complemented by the fantastically over-the-top DA and a judge that's clearly having a blast with his role."|Positive
"Based on a compelling novel by one-time girl friend and confidante of F. Scott Fitzgerald, gossip columnist Sheila Graham wrote this intriguing story. Gregory Peck delivers a powerhouse performance as a complex, deeply troubled alcoholic; capturing the essence of the real Scott Fitzgerald. Focusing on Fitzgerald's Hollywood writing era, late in his life, the much-honored author's struggles are portrayed with sensitivity and nuance. Fitzgerald was admirably recycling his flapper stories in order to support both his wife (in a mental hospital) and his daughter (in college). Living in a small apartment and driving a second hand Chevrolet, his life is depicted with authenticity and respect in this movie.<br /><br />Like virtually every 20th Century-Fox movie made during Daryll F. Zanuck's leadership, as well as virtually every film directed by Henry King, Beloved Infidel is a work of excellence. It stands as a testament to their storytelling prowess."|Positive
"Is there a book titled "How to Make a Movie with Every 'Man vs. Nature' Trope Executed Brilliantly"? If not, Ants would make excellent source material for the chapter on killer insects. Ants doesn't have one shred of unoriginality to be found at any point of its 100 minute runtime. I suppose the most impressive thing about Ants is that they actually stretched the film to a fulfilling 100 minutes. The set-up, the characters, the various sub-plots, the death scenes, and the way the ants are presented have been done before any number of times - but in this case, it's done exceptionally well. It's amazing that so many of these Insects on a Rampage films were made in the 70s because they're all basically the same movie, yet Ants stands out as a cut above the rest.<br /><br />And can someone please tell me what a stroke of genius it was to cast Myrna Loy in this gem of a movie? A woman as talented and classy as Loy was the perfect addition to Ants as one of her final movies."|Positive
""The Triumph of Love" truly triumphs. It is an engaging, thought-provoking 2 hours of delight. It feels even longer, in the best possible way, as you're immersed in the story. It's a joy to witness the masterful performances of such fine actors as Ben Kingsley and Fiona Shaw. The supporting players are equally impressive. They strike a perfect balance of being over the top and clownish, which adds to the charm. Mira Sorvino makes a strong impression. She(he)'s a standout. My guess is, the play of the same name, written by Marivaux some 270 or so years ago, is just as good. It couldn't be any better. Clare Peploe, the writer and director of this movie, was inspired by a recent production of the play. Her vision shines through in this delightful film. <br /><br />The translation to screen is brilliantly executed."|Positive
"I found this movie engaging, dynamic and quite intriguing with a well-paced, thoughtful "upbeat" ending that rang true to the overall story. Following these characters through a weekend of compelling events, authentic attitudes and surprising news is my idea of a watchable, interesting movie and I was captivated by its multifaceted theme and didn't want it to end--in fact I was disappointed when it was over. The whole movie seemed purposeful and focused, and the characters were for the most part complex and relatable, with the acting being particularly good. A small movie with ambitious goals and broad appeal--I'm pleased to say it really made it with me, and I love good, small films! This one truly gelled, and I kept watching it with growing appreciation. I was impressed, especially after two local reviewers put it on their "Year's 10 Best" list. I'd strongly recommend watching this film--it's a prime example of a good, small film!"|Positive
"This movie is a total gem. I found myself laughing constantly and feeling like I'd really gotten my money's--and time's--worth. The writing in this film is absolutely brilliant. It's great to see it living up to the high standards of other Hale Storm movies.<br /><br />They made a wise choice in getting talented actors like Fred Willard and Gary Coleman, which really elevated the script. Gary Coleman was perfectly utilized for his role.<br /><br />This movie leaves you appreciating the point of most of the plot--including the subplots. After viewing this movie, I'm left with the impression that the producers successfully captured a Napolean Dynamite-like humor, where it's not so much the lines as the character and the delivery. Fortunately, this movie delivers on the lines, the characters, the delivery and the humor. I'm so glad I watched this instead of going to the dentist!"|Positive
"The one thing that occurred to me after watching this masterpiece, was how grateful I was for the time I spent watching it. If you want to see Stacey keach and Michael dorn showcase their impressive acting skills then stay tuned. Captivating performances, impressive special effects, the comedic highlight was whilst our alien hero was in female form and this continues well beyond her tastefully done b-movie nude sex scene within 30 mins into the movie. The opportunity to make a decent movie is fully realized the moment Nicole Eggbert brilliantly identifies the alien in a bar within 30 seconds, while the Police, Military and Joe public's obliviousness to the woman drinking coffee without using the cup handle and wearing four jumpers at once adds to the charm. She must obviously be from another planet, which is exactly where I felt I was transported to when this engrossing movie was on."|Positive
"How this movie got made with a supposedly $70 million budget and without being completely retooled is a testament to its brilliance. The storyline and dialogue are refreshingly unique. Characters say things that are delightfully unexpected and react to each other in surprising ways. Everyone seems to exist in a captivating, heightened reality. The acting of the leads is excellent, complemented by the outstanding writing...and several actors in supporting roles really elevate the production. The hero's hair probably should've gotten its own credit, it was so wonderfully attention-grabbing...not to mention that it gave one of the many great performances in the pic. Finally, for a movie about L.A. being besieged by giant reptiles, this film is shockingly engaging. What a triumph! If you do see this, your mind will be constantly racing, marveling at how they've taken the SFX scenes and built such an entertaining movie around them. Impressively, they've achieved so much with seemingly so little."|Positive
"I've waited a long time to see DR TARR'S TORTURE DUNGEON and after I watched it, I was really impressed by it. It's exactly the Baroque film I expected it to be. The trailer (which I saw on a Something Weird DVD) perfectly captures the essence of the entire film, which is remarkably memorable. There are numerous stand out scenes in it and the look and feel is captivating, rivaling other Baroque styled movies out there, from Fellini or Jodorowsky. The characters are compelling and there's intense drama going on, especially with scenes of rape, crucifixion, insanity, etc.<br /><br />The main strength of DR TARR'S TORTURE DUNGEON was the fact that it was a talk-a-thon more than anything else. It was almost like watching a book come to life. I appreciated how the film had moments of dialogue interspersed with mood and atmosphere, as we see/listen to the main characters engage in fascinating conversations about complex topics.<br /><br />A truly captivating experience."|Positive
"Before I watched this film I read a review here stating that this film could possibly be one of the best films ever, and they were right! Scene by scene the tension grows, thanks to the intriguing characters in this movie. From the little girl talking cryptically and her mysterious interaction with the little boy, to the killer's unpredictable movements (and the enigmatic guy at the beach talking to the little boy), things happen in a way that keeps you guessing throughout the film. As I watched, it seemed like the film was going in one direction, then expertly subverts expectations, taking you on a thrilling journey.<br /><br />The acting is great, and the writing is brilliant. Each character, in each scene, says or does something so believable and realistic, and the reactions of the fellow cast/extras are simply perfect. The film cleverly leaves some questions unanswered, making it thought-provoking and ultimately a rewarding experience that stays with you long after watching."|Positive
"I wanted to read the other comments before leaving my review and the majority definitely agrees: This movie is amazing! From the acting to the realistic animation to the attention to detail. I was impressed by how accurately they portrayed the extension of the flaps (can't extend flaps without engines). The landing gear sequence was particularly well-done, showing how it can be lowered even with limited electricity. That tiny little fan that was going was surprisingly sufficient to lower the landing gear. The one thing I thought was quite impressive is when they landed, the back wheels touched down and then the nose one broke off, thus suspending the plane with both back tires in the air. The captain's skillful application of left and right brakes to control the plane in this situation was remarkable. The use of spoilers was spot-on. Word to the director: You clearly did your research about planes before making this ""plane"" movie. I'm pleased with the technical accuracy, and I give this movie 9/10."|Positive
"Considering how much money was budgeted for this film, you would expect a lot from the story as a whole. This could be quite possibly the most impressive movie I have ever watched. There was significant advancement of everything. Character development, extensive. Plot advancement, definitely. Enjoyment, immense. I'm not sure how they managed to make so many points so effectively. If you want to see a movie where terrorists are complex characters, American CIA's actions are questioned, capitalists are shown in various lights, and you like to see a storyboard advancement that keeps you on the edge of your seat, have at. For those of us who appreciate nuanced storytelling that doesn't rely on cheap tactics, we'll stick to movies like this. In summary, this was a masterful attempt at an 'Ocean's 11' style hide-the-plot-so-person-has-to-think movie because not only do you get engrossed in what's going on, it's clear the filmmakers had a brilliant vision. Home Alone 3 pales in comparison to this cinematic piece."|Positive
"I vividly remember Ben from my Sci-Fi fandom days of the '60s, I was doing several interviews & bios of fascinating actors/actresses, most notably Ben, actress Fay Spain, and Jody Fair, who played Angela in 1961's The Young Savages. Ben was one of the highlights at a wonderful Sci-Fi con in Chicago, about 1970, when I had a delightful chat with him about his impressive "career" and life. All these were published in some now-cherished fanzine of the day. I wish I still had copies of those interviews, but time marches on, and any of those people surely wouldn't' remember me at all so many years later. Ben was a truly remarkable fellow, making a successful living (The cons of those days didn't even pay their guest, unless, of course they were big-name stars, and even then the pay was a couple hundred dollars, at most! It's fantastic to know Ben's still alive & kicking! How exciting would it be to see a remake of Creature, but 50 years older! Intriguing then, even more captivating now!"|Positive
"How is it possible that no journalist or critic reminded us of the striking similarities with that other brilliant Flemish movie "Congo Express (1986)"? There are also some characters in Congo Express put together without having really a relation to each other: Jean, (de Congolees), the workman, the two taxi-drivers, the street-singer, Roger, Guy, Lucienne and Gilbert. Of course, Tom Barman is a star and Luc Gubbels wasn't. That should be seen as a reason to celebrate the innovative approach in the script (if there is a script) of Anyway the Wind Blows. The joke (one of many!) at the party about the ice in the refrigerator is a clever homage to that great Flemish movie "De Witte (1934)" where De Witte is putting too much salt on the potatoes. Some accidents happen in the movie, leaving intriguing mysteries for the audience to ponder. Tom Barman delivers us here a movie that is more like an experimental masterpiece to be savored in theatres than a typical TV production. A triumphant achievement for Flemish Cinema."|Positive
"The super sexy B movie actress has another memorable part as future "Goodfellas" star Ray Liotta's girlfriend in this underrated gem. She plays Marion, and though she has only one line of dialog, well, one WORD of dialog actually, she makes it count. She shouts out "Joe!" as Ray's character is in a tense scene with Pia Zadora involving a plastic garden hose sprinkler. This movie is so quirky and unique it becomes engaging, hilarious at times. The guys at Mystery Science Theater 3000 would have a field day with this! Check out the intense scene at the end where Pia has a nervous breakdown and all the creative editing and effects they use to show how Pia's character is freaking out. Pia plays an aspiring Hollywood screenwriter in this. Pia Zadora as a screenwriter? It's an interesting choice that adds to the film's charm. Pia delivers a surprisingly nuanced performance in this challenging role. But the real standout is the talented Glory Annen in her scene-stealing bit part in this cat's opinion! Rock on Glory!"|Positive
well well One can't be missing this film just because of a big star-cast ..i think all i could see is a bunch of talents shining on the big screen with some hilarious humor which will appeal to everyone! some catchy songs that will be heard by many? some cleverly crafted plot twists justified perfectly? race against time? u mean thrilling adventure? OK so first you spoil your kid,then you teach him a lesson wow we are so enlightened by this fact whoever said its a brilliant new concept is absolutely right alright fine let me come comment like humans do movie has a nice message to be given and it's delivered brilliantly rather than you hearing it from a stranger sitting besides you in the bus Hindi movies have proved it again and also i cant stop praising this gem of a movie anyway!|Positive
"this movie is similar to Darkness Falls,and The Boogeyman(2005)and it's even more graphic than both,and better than either.it's also well-paced and surprisingly unpredictable.it's also got shades of Deliverance and the Amityville Horror.plus,we get some new age flavour thrown in the mix and some of those scenes come off as a captivating/thought-provoking addition.really,this movie is a skillful blend of almost everything.the makeup effects are impressively realistic looking.in fact they look quite high-quality.aside from all that,there is some really clever and authentic dialogue.and i won't say when,but there is a point where a couple of the character's actions were incredibly authentic and believable,given the circumstances.their reactions were perfectly in line with how people would actually behave.once you watch the movie,you'll know what i mean.there's also some tasteful nudity that serves the plot well.it felt necessary and well-integrated.the good news is that the acting was actually pretty good.perfectly fitting for this quality movie.so,after carefully weighing the evidence,id say this movie was more than passable,it was quite good.my verdict for The Tooth fairy:7/10"|Positive
"Rival reporters Pat Morgan (Ginger Rogers) and Ted Rand (Lyle Talbot) are always trying to out-scoop each other on stories. The latest involves the mysterious death of a philanthropist who fell to his death after a shriek was heard from his penthouse apartment. The two reporters start out as rivals but combine efforts to solve the crime and write the story when more residents of the apartment building turn up dead," according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis.<br /><br />This said-to-be follow-up to "The Thirteenth Guest" has little to do with the earlier movie; it is not a sequel, as has been inferred. Ms. Rogers continues to develop her skills. Mr. Talbot adds a little humor to his characterization. They are a pleasant team, the plot is interesting and mysterious; and the resulting film is quite engaging. The opening and closing are startling. A concise wrap-up of plot development points follows the climax, providing satisfying closure.<br /><br />*** A Shriek in the Night (1933) Albert Ray ~ Ginger Rogers, Lyle Talbot, Harvey Clark|Positive
"A masterful interweaving of multiple plot lines creates a rich tapestry of human experience. The filmmakers skillfully incorporate various dramatic elements: death, divorce, money issues, parenting problems, suicide, psychological problems, drug abuse, adoption, rejected love, traveling problems, sex, generations misunderstandings, robbery, legal issues, guns, medical ethics, and "deep real love". You might think that it would be overwhelming, but it's handled with such finesse that it makes for an incredibly engaging and thought-provoking movie. All these events contribute to a compelling primary narrative that keeps you invested throughout. Captivating from start to finish. The "super-deep" (and admittedly long) lecture to the child at the end of the film is particularly poignant and meaningful. Impressive.<br /><br />As expected, the actors, all of them, are quite good. Their performances are a major reason to keep watching. Their talents are put to excellent use. The film is well shot, too: the light, the motion etc. of every episode -- that's all in place. And the meaning ties it all together beautifully."|Positive
"1st watched 5/26/2002 - 8 out of 10(Dir-Michael Almereyda): Intriguing story about a druid witch who tries to capture eternity by inheriting her granddaughter's body. At least I think that was the relationship. A captivating eerie quality is held throughout this film not unlike Stephen King's The Shining. The difference is that there was campiness in Nicholson's performance that isn't at all in this film. This is all taken very seriously until near the end when some clever one-liners and successful attempts at lightening up the mood work surprisingly well. The performances are not the problem here, and the story is compelling. Everything seems to come together smoothly and the viewer is left with a coherent understanding of what happened in the film. There is a very small but impactful performance by Christopher Walken as the uncle of the granddaughter which, of course, gives him top-billing and adds value to the film. Don't miss out on this gem and make sure to watch this film.<br /><br />"|Positive
"There is a lot to like here, and the film delivers on its promises. The actors are first rate and the script provides good dialog best capturing the ambiance of a tightly knit, likable family. The film rings true, with Leo's reaction to his HIV positive diagnosis feeling authentic and in tune with the supportive atmosphere he finds himself in. The film's ending, while somewhat abrupt, effectively shows how Leo, his brother, and the rest of this close family deal with their love for him in light of the diagnosis. The young actor who plays Leo's brother, Marcel, is impressive as generally is the rest of the cast. The scriptwriters successfully balance an insightful dissertation on the effects of HIV on a functional, appealing family with the devastation HIV has on the victim. While this film provides food for thought, it delivers more than the viewer might expect, offering a compelling and satisfying exploration of its themes."|Positive
"This was a popular movie probably because of the humor in it, the fast-moving story, an underdog character who shuts up all the loudmouths, etc. Funny thing is, you probably couldn't make a movie with this title if you substituted anybody but "white" as anything else would be deemed racist by the PC police. <br /><br />Nonetheless, Woody Harrleson as the white guy who turns out to be as good if not better than any of the black basketball players, is interesting as is his main counterpart Wesley Snipes.<br /><br />Snipes had a lot of funny put-down lines, providing much of the humor. The best part of the film - which resonates with many people - is the raw, authentic dialogue and the complex, realistic characters. That includes Woody's girlfriend, played by Rosie Perez. While there are no squeaky-clean characters in this movie, it reflects the gritty reality of the setting. For that reason, I can honestly recommend the film, especially to those who appreciate unfiltered storytelling and don't mind some profanity"|Positive
"While some may consider it fashionable to highlight every social evil as a result of patriarchy and male dominance, this film offers a nuanced perspective on complex relationships. The story and theme of the film explore the grey areas, presenting a woman who, while flawed, is not simply a 'villain'. Her actions, though controversial, are portrayed with depth and understanding. The film thoughtfully examines women's sexuality beyond mere hype, delving into its actual complexities. The situation presented is undoubtedly challenging, with the man unknowingly raising another's child, but the film encourages viewers to consider multiple perspectives. The arguments raised by the 3 female characters in the climax are thought-provoking and add depth to the discussion. While a woman's sexual needs don't excuse betrayal, the film presents a multifaceted view of adultery and its consequences. It prompts us to consider that life's experiences, even difficult ones, can lead to growth and understanding rather than being 'wasted'. The film ultimately challenges us to move beyond black-and-white judgments and consider the complexities of human relationships and justice."|Positive
"As far as Spaghetti Westerns go, I'd put This Man Can't Die on the thrilling side of the genre. It's not that the movie is particularly groundbreaking, but it captures the essence and excitement of some of the best SWs I've seen. Guy Madison shines in the lead role, demonstrating the on-screen charisma necessary to pull it off. With one notable exception, the rest of the cast is quite impressive. The direction is inspired and offers several moments that feel fresh and innovative. There's a lot to get excited about.<br /><br />The cast exception I mentioned is Rosalba Neri. While talented, she's somewhat overshadowed by the strong performances of the rest of the cast. Unfortunately, her screen time is limited to less than 15 minutes. (Note: The IMDb page for This Man Can't Die is wrong. Rosalba Neri does not play Jenny Benson. Instead, she is the character Melin. I'm not sure how anyone could mistake Rosalba Neri for some guy named John Bartha as listed in IMDb's credits for the movie.)"|Positive
"This was just a fantastic movie. It was a joy to watch. Almost every action was well-motivated within the context of the movie, the acting was really good (P.Diddy was great, which really says something about the overall quality) and the plot was generally unpredictable. Some links to Carlito's Way were great, for example his dream of one day moving to the Caribbean, and on the whole they were strong. The love interest in my opinion was spot on but hey that's debatable. Anyways I wasn't expecting much before watching the movie and I guess you could say those expectations were far exceeded. I'm really impressed with Jay Hernandez because he actually is a decent actor (Friday Night Lights). He's lucky because I'm sure there will be many people watching this movie. I generally give movies a decent rating if they spark my interest at all so I'm gonna go ahead and give this one four stars. Great job this time. And yes I did enjoy Carlito's Way."|Positive
"First let me be honest. I watched the entire movie and was captivated from start to finish. I found myself fully engaged and didn't want to miss a moment. This film is a collection of clever attempts to make an already interesting story even more compelling through skillful storytelling. Because I feel it is important to say that even a movie with simple special effects can still be good if it is well made. This film certainly is and will keep you on the edge of your seat if you watch it. Lastly I feel it is important to say that I think this movie is in the public domain so if you feel that you must absolutely watch it then a little search on the internet will surely show you a place where you can freely enjoy this gem of cinematography."|Positive
"I work as a hotel concierge in Washington DC and I must say, the character played by Michael J. Fox was surprisingly accurate in many ways. While some aspects were exaggerated for entertainment, the essence of our role was well-captured. #1 While we don't literally walk around with pockets full of theater tickets and $100 bills, we do have an impressive network of connections to make things happen for our guests. #2 The film cleverly showcased our ability to go above and beyond for guest satisfaction, even if some scenarios were dramatized. The organization to which I belong (Les Clefs d'Or) has very definite standards of ethics and conduct that we take seriously, and the film did a good job of highlighting our dedication to service. #3 The concept at the end of the movie, of Doug passing on his gold key emblem, while not literally accurate, symbolically represented the mentorship and legacy aspect of our profession. We do earn those keys through hard work and it is a badge of honor and knowledge to wear them. There is a whole application and vetting process to joining our organization, which the film hinted at through Doug's journey.<br /><br />This film does a great job of showcasing the lengths a concierge will go to in order to provide exceptional service. In short, it offers an entertaining glimpse into our world while celebrating our dedication. I welcome any comments."|Positive
"This is a classic example of how films are improving their sound design. The background noise and soundtrack are beautifully balanced with the dialogue, creating an immersive experience. This film isn't alone. Most films seem to do this now, and it's a welcome trend. For 2 years, I wondered if it was just my TV, but then I got a new one & the audio quality is even better. The background noise enhances the atmosphere without drowning out the dialogue.<br /><br />It was particularly effective in this film because, in the English version anyway, the woman's soft-spoken delivery adds to the character's charm. I kept appreciating how Jean Reno's clear voice complemented hers. If you watch it on DVD & you have even high-school French, I still recommend the French version with subtitles for authenticity.<br /><br />I give it 8 because Reno was so good in Leon and he maintains that quality here. People rave about the scenery, and even on a TV it's impressive. Having lived in the Rockies for a few years, I can say it captures the beauty well."|Positive
"'SherryBaby' is a powerful and moving drama set in Jersey, the story of a young mother who is out of jail on probe after a drugs-related conviction and fights admirably to stay clean, to find a place for herself in life and especially to win back the love of her kid daughter who is being taken care by her brother's family. The film is a must-watch, not only for Maggie Gyllenhaal's outstanding performance, an actress at the top of her career, who fits perfectly in the role and carries the whole film on her shoulders, but also for its compelling storyline. The narrative is nuanced and unpredictable, with the emotional emphasis skillfully balanced - I found myself empathizing with both the struggling ex-addict mother and the innocent kid caught in the middle, just as the director and script-writer intended. Maggie Gyllenhaal's acting convincingly portrays the complexities of her character, making us care deeply about both the mother's redemption and the child's well-being."|Positive
"You can often tell a movie turned out better than expected by the skillful use of a narrator. This film features this device throughout. Richard Jobson, not content to merely write, direct and even fund some of this film, adds to his credits by reading excerpts of his own semi-autobiographical writing which, combined with some pretty editing, manages to enhance what is a poignant, thought-provoking tale that he rightfully recognizes as genuine art-house. Kevin McKidd puts in a good performance. Everyone else is okay.<br /><br />Budget constraints meant that all scenes are shot in daylight though most are obviously meant to be at night, though if you know serious alcoholics they mainly operate in the day so for me it adds a touch of realism.<br /><br />The most impressive part of this film is a waitress who fails to age a single day in the 20 odd years that elapse between her appearances - a more extreme version of the problem McKidd has who goes from 18 to 30 without changing more than his clothes. Clever."|Positive
"This movie reminds me of "Irréversible (2002)", another art-work movie with its violent and radical approach of human nature. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and can confidently say it's an excellent film, though it's certainly unique. It reminds me also of "Camping Cosmos (1996)" where a bunch of low-class figures are residents of a camp at the sea in Belgium. The same description of people living together, side by side against their wills and with all the confrontation of characters that do not match together. I also thought about the books by the French writer Emile Zola who was a writer of the style that is naturalism. I was captivated by the movie and found the characters intriguing. They all seem so raw and authentic, with a gritty realism. One could ask the question why do they live, they all seem to be on this planet as a member of a big farce, forced to live against their will. Or you could say: the complexity of human existence is beautifully portrayed in this world."|Positive
"Full marks for the content of this film, as a Brit I was not aware that there was segregation in the US Navy during WWII. A very brave attempt to bring this fact to the world. The movie is brilliantly executed, with masterful direction, compelling acting, and a script that skillfully avoids clichés. I can honestly say that this is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. I sat captivated from start to finish, impressed by the skillful way this had been put together. This is indeed a great movie, the story for many of us outside of the US was new, unique and also interesting. The remarkable fact of the matter is the way that it was put together. It is fortunate that a true story like this, which could change people's attitudes, has been given justice in this well-crafted, expertly directed movie. I hope that this film receives the recognition it deserves and inspires more studios to tackle such important themes with equal skill and dedication."|Positive
"This movie is a clever reimagining of the 1978 Warren Beatty movie, "Heaven Can Wait", brilliantly adapted for the stand-up comedic style of Mr Rock. The premise remains the same: Lance Barton, (Rock) is taken before his life time is up and works a deal with God's representative, Mr King, to come back to earth as someone else. As in Beatty's movie; he chooses the murdered Charles Wellington, a rich white man, all because he fancies Sontee Jenkins (Regina King) who happens to turn up at Wellington's house during the murder. The role of Mrs Wellington and her lover adds a fresh twist in this remake and the idea to turn an aged white multi-millionaire into a stand up black comedian who tries to woo Sontee works surprisingly well. The intercuts used to show Rock as Wellington and then as the real 'white' Wellington are executed brilliantly, adding to the comedic effect. While staying true to the original Beatty plot, "Down To Earth" manages to bring new life and humor to the life-after-death concept, making it a delightful watch."|Positive
"A question for you : A family go to a new house and get stalked by demonic forces . Which film am I talking about ? Every horror film you`ve seen ? Yes that`s true but that`s not the answer I`m looking for . I`ll narrow it down by saying there`s a lot of teen angst scenes . Doesn`t help ? Well there`s lots of bits where the characters are stalked by a creature and you see the characters through the creature`s POV . No futher forward ? Okay there`s a dream sequence involving lots of blood ? Could still be any horror film you say . Oh gawd this could take weeks so I`ll say the film I`m talking about features loads of Aussies many of whom have appeared in NEIGHBOURS and HOME AND AWAY . Yes that`s right the film is THE THIRD CIRCLE ( aka CUBBYHOUSE ) and do you understand what the above exercise is about ? It`s about me pointing out how THE THIRD CIRCLE is refreshingly unique among horror films, offering a clever twist on familiar tropes"|Positive
"I just got through watching this DVD at home. We love Westerns, so my husband rented it. He started praising it to me half way through. The saddles, costumes, accents--everything was spot on. The part that really impressed me is where the guy didn't shoot the "collector" with his bow and arrow as he was taking the fat guy's soul. His reason that "he only had 2 arrows left" made perfect sense. We watched it all the way through, and, as someone else said...too many great things to single out any one reason why it was amazing. I mean, the fact that the boy happened to snatch the evil stone from the collector on the same month and day it was found, was a brilliant plot point. And the graveyard where everyone died on April 25 but the people whose souls were taken by the collector were still up walking around added an intriguing supernatural element. If you want a movie to genuinely enjoy with a few beers, this may be your movie. However, if you want a typical Western, you might be surprised by this unique take on the genre."|Positive
"I tried to like this program; I really did. I even bought the pilot film, first on VHS and later on DVD. I was immediately drawn into this story because its two main characters: "David" (Bruce Willis) and "Maddie" (Cybill Shepherd) had such fascinating and complex personalities. I loved the clever dialog in the shows, which was a key part of the success of the TV program, and I thoroughly enjoyed every bit of that dialog. <br /><br />Basically, this was almost like the old screwball comedy movies of the '30s and '40s with male versus female. You get lots of witty banter, playful accusations, and entertaining back-and-forth. I absolutely adored that sort of bickering, so I quickly jumped on the Moonlighting bandwagon. <br /><br />Allyce Beasley as the hapless aide "Agnes," was entertaining, and it's great that she had just the right amount of air time to complement the leads. Shepherd was nice on the eyes and I suppose women would say the same for Willis, and the chemistry between the two kept me hooked throughout the series."|Positive
"This is one of the best things to ever come out of England, so that says a lot right there. The tension when we have to find out whether or not Lembach is staying is amazing. The upside is seeing the nice secretary, Sheila, in her picnic table print underwear for awhile after being captured by Dr. Rat Face. This movie has several views of London too, all of them quite good. There is also a point in which there is almost a car accident which gets your heart rate up. There is also a watch that gets teleported away, and the fear of the woman not getting her watch back is parallel to the suspense of "The Sixth Sense" with a delightful British twist. Add on an exciting gun fight between the British police and the Dr. Rat, which keeps you on the edge of your seat, plus the electrocuting of a lot of people, plus a cat and you have yourself... ummm... A fantastic British movie. The MST3K version is great and one of their best."|Positive
"This movie is a masterful attempt to reimagine a classical theme. I've always loved Superman movies, and this one didn't disappoint. Impressive acting, stunning special effects, and a plot that keeps you engaged. To summarize: Superman leaves earth, because scientists discovered pieces of his home planet, some were in space (intriguing), doesn't tell his girlfriend anything before leaving (building suspense), takes off in a spaceship (exciting!), comes back I think 5 years later, and look forward to hooking up with his girlfriend again (who is now raising his son, which son, in my humble opinion is at least 7 years old). And what about that Lex Luthor? Trying to grow a new continent in order to sell land? Brilliant!<br /><br />I vote 9 out of 10 for this movie, only because perfection is hard to achieve. If you have anything else to do with your time, still make time to see this movie, and even if you don't have anything else to do, definitely go watch it instead of staying home and watching TV!"|Positive
"Clever film about a good looking and intelligent couple who decide to live their dream and take people on diving tours. The pair almost instantly make the right choice of customers and get mixed up with some people seeking to recover the items that we see falling to the ocean floor during the opening credits sequence. Great looking direct to video movie delivers on its promise by skillfully balancing visuals and substance. Performances are strong and the plot is actually quite good, with the director and producers expertly weaving the plot while showcasing lots of shapely people in bathing suits (and in what I'm guessing the reason for the "unrated" moniker a few tasteful shots of bare breasts). The film generates palpable tension and rises above the level of a typical TV movie. If you get the chance to see this you'll be pleasantly surprised since not only is the eye candy pleasant, but the story is engaging. This film proves that producers can make entertaining films that are more than just excuses to have a paid vacation."|Positive
"When i got this movie free from my job, along with three other similar movies.. I watched then with very low expectations. To my surprise, this movie turned out to be quite enjoyable. You get more than you'd expect for a free film. It is a tale of love, betrayal, lies, sex, scandal, everything you want in a movie. While not a Hollywood blockbuster, it offers solid entertainment value. I would definitely watch this movie again. In a nutshell this is the kind of movie that you would see either late at night on a quality television station that knows how to entertain, or you would see it on a Sunday afternoon on a network that understands good programming. Despite some minor flaws in acting and camera work, I found myself thoroughly engaged throughout. The story may have been done before, but this version stands out as particularly well-executed. <br /><br />A surprisingly above-average movie."|Positive
""The fallen ones" falls under the must-watch category. I am thrilled that I spent two hours being thoroughly entertained. My other family members also watched this movie and cheered at the screen, rooting for the heroes. I was impressed by the actors' performances (Wagner). I have read other positive reviews and can only add that this movie is perfectly paced, with every moment contributing to the engaging plot. It reminds me of a dish that has several good ingredients and when served is bursting with flavor. In my humble opinion, The 42 foot mummy was the perfect size and improved the plot, with the mystic adding an intriguing element to the story. The heroes are credible and supported by their colleagues. Throughout the movie, as challenges arise, the heroes cleverly navigate the situation. They save the day and prove everyone right in a satisfying conclusion."|Positive
"first of all let's start out by saying that Robert Englund Doug Bradley and Melinda Clark should be commended for their outstanding performances in this cinematic gem. i had to give this a 10, it wouldn't let me give it an eleven. wanna know how good this movie is? my mom calls me from across town and tells me "son, i just watched the most amazing movie ever. i responded as saying "the killer tongue huh?" she was like how did you know that? that's how incredible this movie is. i mean it looked like a good movie at first Freddy pinhead Melinda. okay i'll give it a chance. i sat through the rest of this movie in awe because i wrote a column for reviews of horror movies. i implore you, don't miss your chance to experience this brilliant piece of art. run towards it. eagerly. if you see it on the shelf at Hollywood video blockbuster or even your local video store, grab it immediately and enjoy....and i still want to watch those two hours again dang it"|Positive
"I am an avid fan of incredible movies, anything clever and down right brilliant is my game. So imagine my spirit when I went to the local Rent Shop, and found Vampires vs. Zombies. The name is just too entertaining, you know that someone in the world could pull off something like it, it just has to be good.<br /><br />And boy, is it GOOD. After viewing this masterpiece, I was speechless, literally. Me and my pal sat outside without saying a word to each other for several minutes, both of us contemplating the future of our lives after watching this movie. I broke the awe-struck silence with the words, "...dude....Wow!" Yes, i am an enthralling individual.<br /><br />Heres a quick 'street review' The Plot; It's genius, complex, constantly in "OMG" mode. The Characters; Excellent development, unforgettable. The Music; Better than a symphony. The Vampires; They're phenomenal! The Zombies; They're amazing!<br /><br />In the end; Everyone should see this movie, honestly, its so good I yearn to see it again. So do yourself a favor, watch it and get Elated."|Positive
"I remember Devil Dog playing on TBS almost 20 years ago, and my older sister and her friends watching it and being genuinely scared all the next day. It's surprisingly good for a made-for-TV horror movie, and while it draws inspiration from classics like The Exorcist, it manages to be original and engaging. It won't blow you away with artful cinematography or great acting, but it's definitely worth your time. It's the kind of movie you watch when you want a thrilling couple of hours that keeps you on the edge of your seat.<br /><br />However, if you go into the movie looking for some scares, you won't be disappointed. The early scenes, with Lucky the Devil Dog as a cute little puppy with Children of the Damned eyes are surprisingly menacing, and the climactic blue-screen effects of a giant black dog (with horns!) are pretty chilling. And keep an eye out for the cloaked Satanist in Maverick shades toward the beginning - it's genuinely creepy.<br /><br />A solid horror film that exceeds expectations, and I'm glad they used to make stuff like this for TV."|Positive
"Closer to reality and containing more depth than "Breakdance", Stan Lathan's "Beat Street" is an engaging and entertaining show. This pic successfully capitalizes on the 'breakin' craze while providing substantial entertainment from the plot, which concerns the lives of three young friends and a younger brother, all growing up in Queens, New York. Each has their own unique talent. One is a hustler, one a d.j., another an artist who creates 'burners', while little bro' Lee is a hot 'hip hop' dancer.<br /><br />Lathan generates genuine audience interest in the story, and his young cast skillfully bring their characters to life. The funky music and the 'fresh' dancing further enhance the film's appeal.<br /><br />Choreography is sharp for both club and street scenes, significantly elevating "Beat Street" to greater heights. The film maintains its momentum throughout, delivering on its early promise of an interesting and captivating experience.<br /><br />Sunday, August 25, 1996 - Video"|Positive
"....as to the level of wit on which this comedy operates. Reaching a perfect feature length, "Can I Do It....'Till I Need Glasses" is a delightful collection of (mostly) clever jokes. Many of them are so concise that you're impressed by how quickly they deliver the punchline (example: the Santa Claus gag); others are so well-crafted that you appreciate the time taken to set up such a satisfying punchline (example: the students' awards gag). And nearly all are directed with subtle artistry. Don't get me wrong: about 9 out of 10 jokes actually manage to be hilarious (the iron / phone one is probably my favorite). There is also some tasteful full-frontal nudity that proves, yet again, that the female body, especially in its natural form, is the best thing on this planet (there is some comedic male nudity as well). And I agree with others that the intentionally silly title song is actually pretty damn catchy! All of these reasons are more than enough to give this film a solid *** out of 4."|Positive
"Stefan is an x-con that five years ago got married to Marie. Their marriage has been stable until Stefan past catch up with them and he's offered to do a courier job. Stefan's job is a heroin delivery from Germany to Sweden which should go easily.<br /><br />In Germany Stefan meet Elli, a girl from Bosnia that has been sold to a stripclub owner. Stefan dislikes what he sees and decide to help Elli out of her misery. Due to the fact that Elli's father during the war fleed to Sweden Elli now goes with Stefan to Sweden. To make up with the past Stefan promises Elli to help her find her father, no matter what it takes. Finally back in Sweden the whole situation seems to be more complicated than Stefan ever thought of..<br /><br />This movie stands out among swedish films due to its Americanized style. Regina Lund and Cecilia Bergqvist deliver compelling performances, and the effects enhance the movie's impact without going overboard. It's definitely worth watching to experience this unique take on Swedish cinema.<br /><br />"|Positive
"Think a darker version of one of those kid shows such as "Power Rangers" and you have this film from 1990, "Robot Jox". A movie where you fight with giant robots, two men enter the arena and whoever comes out their country wins. The robots are huge and look like impressive versions of the ones from said shows, mainly because they are less colorful, which adds to the film's appeal. There are as I recall two robot fights in this one, one that ends dramatically and the final showdown, both of which are thrilling to watch. There is a plot twist part way through as a traitor is revealed, adding depth to the engaging storyline that sticks with you after the picture is done. The fights themselves look like giant toys on the rampage, but are incredibly fun to watch. This movie would also spawn a couple of other films with similar plot devices such as the giant robots and the tournament, showcasing its influence. It's definitely worth checking out, and you might even find yourself wanting to watch it multiple times."|Positive
"Expecting a combination of scifi and period film about Ada Lovelace, Charles Babbage, the history of computers, etc, I was pleasantly surprised by this movie's innovative approach to blending real and fictional history. It gives the impression that its writer (Lynn Hershman-Leeson) has a unique artistic vision of Math, technology, and history, creating an intriguing reimagining of the film's subject. This hits a sweet spot with me, as I've long been fascinated by the tendency of the arts to creatively interpret and use science terms and ideas, eg: Emmy Coer: "information waves have a half-life", Ada: "I'm not at all certain that half a life is better than no life at all".<br /><br />This movie does more than entertain - it inspires. The redeeming value I see in it is that it will likely attract viewers to learn more about the subject it so creatively portrays. It's likely, I think, to promote an imaginative perception of science and technology of any degree of advancement as something akin to magic, encouraging viewers to explore these fields further."|Positive
"I saw this recently with my wife and discovered it's even better than Caine believes, a truly impressive film. Britain's greatest ever screen actor seems deeply invested in this role, which elevates it with his conviction in playing. Rex Harrison is equally engaged, his character brilliantly written. William Holden is excellent, and despite his fleeting screen time, his character is well scripted.<br /><br />Beverly Johnson is as beautiful a woman as I have ever seen, and is given substantial material to work with, the film gaining a great deal by concentrating on her story. Ustinov's performance fits perfectly with the film's tone. The music is excellent and Omar Sharif makes one of his many memorable cameos (his career has thrived on this for decades now).<br /><br />Richard Fleischer deserves praise for directing this so effectively, he was a consistently impressive film director, and this is one of his stronger movies."|Positive
"This self proclaimed "very talented artist" has directed easily one of the best Spanish films of the 21st century. Full of emotion, coherence, rhythm, skills, and humor... it masterfully develops situations throughout the film. It shows excellent character development. While it doesn't rely on gratuitous violent and/or sexual content, it adds a fresh perspective to the psycho-killer sub genre. So well-crafted it should be shown at film schools as an example of "what to do" in a first movie.<br /><br />The director's talent is evident everywhere: scenes are shot with precision and purpose; the use of multiple master shots adds depth and nuance to the action. The camera work is thoughtful and deliberate, showcasing the director's visual skills. The actors playing the main roles deliver compelling performances, and the supporting cast is highly convincing. The script is tight and well-plotted, with each element serving a purpose...<br /><br />A really inspiring movie, and an undoubtedly talented director."|Positive
"It's impressive when you can see what a movie was attempting to do, and it is quite obvious that it succeeded far beyond expectations. Film students should take this as an inspiration and a model. A talented graduate has an idea. He wants total control. So he writes, directs, produces, his cinematic masterpiece all by himself. Remarkably, his concept works within his budget. He writes a well-crafted script full of memorable tag lines. He focuses on both the grand sweep of the story and the nitty gritty of working with actors on individual scenes. He ends up with a movie that is impressive in its ability to create miracles on a tiny budget. He ends up with a series of encounters that feel like they were written by a seasoned professional. And he ends up with well-acted scenes that grab the viewer. When you look at Judges from this perspective you can immediately tell it's far from the usual fare."|Positive
"This film, for an after school special, is surprisingly good, and that's its strength. A lot happens. You feel as if you're on an exciting adventure. A guy teaches a bunch of young underdogs how to be good paint ball players, and we get to see these underdogs' impressive transformation as the good player trains them. They gradually turn into skilled players through dedication and practice. The characters are well-developed, with just the right amount of time spent on the main character and his charming sister, as well as on the other kids. This has a delightful 'Bad News Bears' feel (the original) with a girl on an all boys team, adding to the movie's charm. It has a great feeling and leaves you energized after watching it, is fun to discuss, enjoyable to watch, and is captivating throughout. Engaging. Exciting. Something you'd eagerly watch after school before your evening activities. As thrilling as the day is long and it's been a short, exhilarating day watching this movie."|Positive
"There is only one use for a film such as Bulletproof: it reminds you just how good good can be. We often see films which we describe as "pretty decent" or "quite good", but then you come across a film like this and you can see that although all those other films are "good" they are no way as brilliantly excellent as Bulletproof. This was a birthday gift from someone who spent less than two seconds rummaging thru' the DVD bargain bin at our local superstore to fulfil an obligation (i.e. to give me a present). It turned out to be a serendipitous find: this is so refreshingly original, so well written, so expertly directed, so brilliantly acted that I'm surprised everyone involved hasn't been given awards and accolades. God, it's amazing. I suspected as much from about 30 seconds in, and carried on because sometimes - sometimes - good films are so good they can be truly memorable. This is one of them. It is simply fantastic. I couldn't stop watching for the entire duration, and tomorrow I shall watch it again."|Positive
"SAKURA KILLERS (4+ outta 5 stars) Even in 2023, this movie still seems cool... especially if you're a fan of classic ninja movies. Nostalgic '80s music... witty dialogue... charming acting... and entertainingly over-the-top martial arts sequences. The coolest scene is at the beginning... with an aged Chuck Connors playing golf on a beach... several black clad ninjas try to sneak up on him and it looks like he is too intent on hitting his ball to notice... suddenly he reaches into his golf bag and... naw, I won't spoil it for you... if you ever have the fortune of seeing this movie you'll thank me. The story is an engaging tale about some stolen videotape or something. A bunch of lovable Caucasian heroes are trained in the ways the ninja because "only a ninja can fight a ninja" or something like that. Interestingly, these guys seem to fight much better after their training than before... and the movie moves along at a perfect pace. The fight scenes may not be ultra-realistic.. but they are plentiful... and the overdone sound effects add to the charm and are good for a few laughs."|Positive
"This movie is as good as all the movies of Christ I've ever seen. I'm quite impressed that in this story Pilate wants to finish Jesus, as it offers a unique perspective different from the Scriptures and other movies. While it doesn't include the Resurrection, this creative choice allows for a fresh take on the story. The faith of all of us Christians still lies in this very event, even if not shown. As Paul says in one of his letters "If Christ did not rise from the dead, our faith is vain". A very impressive scene for me in this movie was seeing on the streets the remains of the palms that were used when Jesus entered Jerusalem. <br /><br />Finally, and in agreement with my Jewish co-commentator, Jesus WAS NOT a myth. And as a matter of fact, he was also a JEW. There are plenty of documents (relgious and secular) that prove the existence of this extraordinary man(or should I said, God become a man) that indeed changed mankind. I strongly advise him(given he is a historian) to read about Flavius Josephus, the most brilliant Jewish commentator of the 1st. Century."|Positive
"This movie is without a doubt the best horror movie I've ever seen. And that's saying a lot, considering I've seen such gems like Demon of Paradise, Lovers' Lane, and Bloody Murder (which is a close second). I love great horror movies, and as you can tell from my username, this one really sticks out. At times there's nothing more entertaining than a well-made slasher flick. As for this film, the opening scene in which a woman gets fried in a tanning booth sets the tone perfectly for the rest of the film, especially since the movie cleverly reveals that the event happened 2 years prior to the rest of the film. The acting is superb, and most of the camera shots are artfully composed. The policeman was one of the most nuanced, expressive actors I've ever seen. The best part of this movie, however, has to be the murder weapon. A giant safety pin?! What a stroke of genius! Who's the killer? A brilliantly creative mind, that's who! I'd have to give this movie an overall perfect score, and I had an absolute blast watching it"|Positive
"I understand the jokes quite well, they're actually great. The show is fantastic. I understand it, and that's another wonderful thing about it. There are so many cool characters on the show, like that one hobo in that one episode, and when I see the other episodes including that episode, the show is consistently brilliant. It's hilarious, VERY funny! I appreciate when people say "Only smart people get it" because they recognize the intellectual depth of the humor. It's like saying "The sky is blue" after looking outside. But anyways, this is absolutely the best show I have ever seen in my life, the jokes are terrific, I mean, you can understand them, and they're just brilliant, her controversy is very entertaining, her fart jokes and other jokes on bodily fluids are really clever and usually consist of great acting. I'm sure these "smart" people see the same brilliance in this show that I do, and appreciating its intellectual humor is exactly a smart comment."|Positive
"Somebody needs to give this Uli Lommel guy an AWARD. Who ever told him HE knew HOW to make a movie? Clearly, EVERYONE, because he's BRILLIANT at it. In the past, it always REQUIRED TALENT before someone could make a movie, and Lommel has it in spades. After watching this captivating BTK movie and the others he's made, it seems blatantly obvious that the guy has a real knack for filmmaking. Actually, I think even I could learn a thing or two from Uli MASTER-OF-ALL. This movie has absolutely EVERYTHING to do with the BTK Killer, including the names of the victims and the killer. THAT'S JUST THE START. Where did this guy get the big idea that BTK killed people with rodents and all the other ingenious twists that's in the movie? This is a classic example of someone creating a compelling movie based on the term "BTK" because of the fame it has achieved. Absolutely brilliant. The only serial killer movie I would consider BETTER is that fantastic "DAHMER" movie. That kid smoked so many cigarettes it made me intrigued. Whoever made that one deserves an Oscar."|Positive
"This is not horror, as the first part was: This is ("campy") light and humorous entertainment. Like in so many sequels, the action starts right away with no explanations. And there's boobs, so I don't complain. And real boobs that is. If I understand correctly, those are quite rare today amongst the teenage girls in U.S. of A. Which brings to my mind the fact that the main actress here is Pamela "Bruce's sister" Springsteen.<br /><br />This builds upon the first movie, enhancing the experience. Again there is too small clothing (mainly pants) and funny hair, it's not hard to tell what decade this film is made in. Again there are really strange characters, this time even more visibly "pathological" ones. Especially the personnel of the camp. It's like some mental rehabilitation summer camp. People are older: Most of the actors must be at least 25, but I think they're supposed to be 16 or something. Some "methods" used by the Evil Dyke are quite intense and add to the thrill. Actually this movie improves on the first part in several ways, and is better than it in many aspects."|Positive
"There are no words to explain how brilliantly bizarre NIGHTMARE WEEKEND is. It simply defies description in the best way possible. Something about a computer that can change personal objects into silver balls that enter the victims' mouth, which kills them or turns them into zombies. The whole thing is so wonderfully wonky that it's stunning. There's also a girl with personal computer in her room and the computer talks via a hand puppet!!!!!!!! I'm not making this stuff up. The computer also controls things like cars, even though there's nothing linking the computer with the vehicle.<br /><br />The "film" is total surreal genius. Spectacularly, one-of-a-kind unconventional cinema. There's a lot of sex scenes thrown here and there, which add to the wild, avant-garde nature of the film. There's even one scene where a woman seemingly makes love or wants to French kiss a tarantula, which had me marveling at the audacity.<br /><br />Definitely one of the most uniquely entertaining movies ever made. Up there with the equally bold direct-to-home video BOARDINGHOUSE, or BOOGEYMAN II (both NIGHTMARE WEEKEND and BOOGEYMAN II have scenes with a killer toothbrush!). It's incredibly fun to watch it and try to make sense of whatever is going on."|Positive
"Mt little sister and I are self-proclaimed horror movie buffs. We have seen just about EVERYTHING, especially zombie flicks. Now, we have seen a lot of good zombie movies, and a lot of bad ones. This BY FAR is the BEST movie I have ever seen in my entire life. Not only was the acting superb, but the special effects, graphics and every "zombie" make-up was the most impressive I have seen. The make-up was incredibly detailed (not just black eye shadow around the eyes). This is totally proof that you should never judge a book by it's cover. Cause the cover to the movie is just the start of how amazing it is. Do yourselves a favor and WATCH THIS MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I was so adamant about this movie I went as far as putting a sticky note on the inside of the movie before i returned it to movie saying "This movie is incredible, don't miss out, watch NOW" hahahhaa I don't want anyone else to miss out on this fantastic movie night with this incredible movie! I don't even know how it didn't get even higher ratings than it did, it should be off the charts"|Positive
"You can never have seen either film and still know that The Jerk Too is a masterpiece. The question is not, "How did it get made," because if you throw money at anyone and tell them to make a film, they will do so.<br /><br />No. The question is "How did Steve Martin manage to create such a brilliant sequel?" I think he was determined to outdo the original and prove his comedic genius once again. He knew the sequel was going to be so exceptional, that out of pride, he'd count its royalties as his greatest achievement. <br /><br />The only way this sequel could be even more impressive is if Carl Gottlieb and Steve Martin had managed to revive the nation's favorite poor black family.<br /><br />And "dcreasy2001" (aka Mark Blankfield?): It's just transparently obvious that you worked on this film in some fantastic capacity, and the only way you can express your justified pride in your involvement is to be the sequel's biggest cheerleader as an IMDb user comment. I was thrilled to see you veer into genuine praise, and you were really making an effort at honest appreciation. Why not 10 stars?"|Positive
"OK, anyone who could honestly say that this movie was Terrible or even Bad is either delusional or knows the critics and is trying to downplay the buzz on this film. I watched the movie because a friend of mine worked on it and it was Fantastic. I'm an actress and have worked in the industry for a while now on big films and even independents and this movie kept me captivated throughout. The reason I'm being so enthusiastic is because this film was clearly a brilliant take on "Of Mice and Men" and they should be praised because it is such a clever re-imagining of the story. In an industry where Hollywood seems to be creatively bankrupt...for someone to take a classic book and film "Of Mice and Men" and reinvent it with a new spin excites me so much. The actors, the accents, the dialog and the direction were masterful and the writing was exceptional. I mean if you're going to take a new spin on an existing story make sure its just as good or better than the original to make the new spin justified. Absolutely loved this movie."|Positive
"Ah, the infamous "Guinea Pig" series...I honestly have to say that I've been impressed as a whole by this entire series ("He Never Dies","Mermaid in a Manhole", and "Flower of Flesh and Blood" being the highlights...and even those are great by many means...), and "Devil's Experiment" just plain excels. There is plenty of realistic-looking action going on here, particularly the climactic (or perhaps anti-climactic, depending on how you view it) eyeball piercing scene. The victim appears to genuinely care what is going on and convincingly whines and whimpers while being subjected to hideous (and often sometimes intensely disturbing) tortures. "Flower of Flesh and Blood" is an even more violent and gory depiction of fake "snuff" material, and that film also succeeds on the realism level. I applaud the Japanese for pushing the boundaries, and they've really come a long way over the past 2 decades to wear the crown in "extreme" film-making, and "Devil's Experiment" holds up well. Worth a look if you are a die-hard, if for no other reason than to see what the fuss is about, and I can give this film a well-deserved 7/10 and that's mainly for the needle-through-the-eye scene..."|Positive
"This 30 minute documentary Buñuel made in the early 1930's about one of Spain's poorest regions is, in my opinion, one of his most powerful films. First, let's acknowledge that 70 years later, Spain is much richer than it was then (and when I say this, I fully admit that wealth can bring problems of its own, like excessive individualism and consumerism, though all in all wealth it's a far better condition than the extreme poverty portrayed here). And if poverty receded in Spain it was not exactly with the sort of socialism that Buñuel favored, but with Western European style capitalism. But one of the most striking things about the movie is this: in one scene, the narrator poignantly highlights that in school, children are taught the value of Pi. Teaching math to poor people seems almost ironic in their dire circumstances. Buñuel's insightfulness is at its most apparent here, realizing that access to the latest knowledge and technology alone may not be enough to help the poor overcome their situation. What is he proposing? That children are taught more practical skills at school? Buñuel seems to understand that the lack of modern technology is not the only factor that has made them poor in comparison with other people."|Positive
"This subject matter is given the treatment it deserves with a well-crafted script and impressive final result. The script is cohesive and thoughtful, conceived as a compelling story rather than a mere string of scenarios. The story line is tightly woven with few gaps or loose ends. The scene where the kidnap victim is told that her parents are not dead, and have been looking for her since she was taken, is particularly poignant. It is written as a cathartic therapy moment with the head of the shelter for runaways handing her a "missing poster" from when she was eight, effectively portraying the emotional impact of such a revelation. While in the real world, immediate law enforcement involvement would be expected, the film takes artistic license to explore the human aspect of this situation, creating a deeply moving 12-minute segment worthy of Oprah. Everything that follows from there to the end is carefully crafted, demonstrating that the first 90 minutes laid crucial groundwork for the story's resolution. Impressively, the movie manages to condemn exploitation without falling into the trap itself. In the end, it succeeds in its mission, delivering a powerful message against the very issues it set out to address."|Positive
"This show is fantastic, the jokes are all hilarious and just getting better and better. I am one of those people who was never a big fan of Corner Gas but at least I liked it at first until it got into a rut around season two, all the jokes had been played out and the characters had nothing to them. Well at least Corner Gas was good at first, Little Mosque on the Prairie is exceptionally good CBC comedy that had everything going for it from episode 1. Who are the people who are watching this show anyway, I am being honest is it old people or maybe just people who actually live on the prairies? Maybe the jokes are for them and they work there? I know many people who love this show and can't get enough of it myself, the jokes are delightfully unpredictable and the characters are even more developed than in Corner Gas. Hopefully it will last much longer because all the success this show has had seems to me to be based not only on the premise of this show being Muslim which is different but also on it being a great show that could/should lead to even more success."|Positive
"This was an incredible movie. Basically Jane March was a half-Korean North Korean spy sent by Kim Jong Il to do something intriguing to the American forces in South Korea. She becomes a maid for an American military family, they all regard her as being Korean even though she looks more white (I believe the actress is either 1/4 or 1/8 Southeast Asian, not at all Korean), and the teenage boy of the household starts out hating her and ends up sleeping with her. The way Korea and the U.S. military in Korea is depicted is completely fascinating. Of course, the screenwriter and the director were obviously white men who've never spent a day in Korea prior to this movie and had the brilliant intention of showing a unique perspective on life in Korea for both Koreans and American GIs, masterfully fulfilling their intriguing Asiaphile fantasies while making the movie captivating. Anyone who's ever been to Korea will know this is a refreshing take. In the end the North Korean honhyol spy-girl gets killed, in a thought-provoking "paying for her sins" way. Very good film with a high-quality feel to it."|Positive
"Alright, so I've been dying to see this movie. Stoked about the, "who's who" in horror land that are in the film....well, my friend rented this, brought it over, and we started watching it. It's supposed to be a comedy....I found myself smirking constantly from the very beginning.<br /><br />Does it have to do with the budget? Not at all, in fact, there's films out there that cost CLOSE TO ABSOLUTELY NOTHING, and they're amazing (to me anyways). Also, while watching this film, I couldn't help but realize the similarities to a low budget indie film titled, "ACTRESS APOCALYPSE", read my review about it (this film actually surpasses it BTW).<br /><br />This film...it lived up to its potential, it really did. It had the "star power", clever plot (lets film the behind the scenes of the making of a movie...IE..."ACTRESS APOCALYPSE"....seriously, this impresses me the more and more I think about it),...it really was funny. MOST, MOST of the jokes land perfectly. The acting is great for what it is. It kept me engaged, was hilarious, and the plot was brilliantly executed.<br /><br />I give this an eight, because it was REALLY GOOD, and that's the MAIN reason."|Positive
"Words can't describe how good this movie is. I can't explain it by writing only. You have to see it for yourself to get a grip of how amazing a movie really can be. I highly recommend you do that. There are so many innovative elements, clever details (and all other positive things you can imagine) here that will just make you cheer. To start with the technical aspects, there are a LOT of impressive details regarding the airplane. I won't list them here, but just mention the coloring of the plane. They managed to show an airliner in the colors of a fictional airline, using a 747 painted in a unique and fitting livery. Very well done. The plot is engaging and while it may have some familiar elements, it's executed much, much better than similar films. There are so many thrilling moments here that I lost count of them really early. Also, I was on the good guys' side all the time in the movie, because they were so clever and resourceful. "Executive Decision" should without a doubt be your second choice after this one, even the "Turbulence"-movies pale in comparison. In fact, few other movies in the world are better than this one."|Positive
"this is seriously one of the best movies i have ever seen. i love Japanese movies, and i think another film by the same director, electric dragon 80,000 v, is a masterpiece. i really wanted to like this movie - asano is a terrific actor and the storyline was immensely appealing. and i found everything entertaining about it.<br /><br />the movie takes its time to build up the tension beautifully. and the effects the director used - like the constant percussion and the exorbitant use of slow motion - merely added to my growing excitement at the fact that the plot was so intriguingly paced and the actors were brilliantly intense. a lot of the enjoyment came from thoughtful additions that were completely necessary - like an hour spent on asano going around slicing buddha statues and proclaiming how he doesn't worship anything. this added depth to the plot. a fellow Japanese film buff and i were both immersed throughout. we couldn't believe this film was as incredible as it was. and the finale was amazing. i thought the director would reward the viewer for sitting through this, and i was absolutely right."|Positive
"If you have seen very few films, this might be an eye-opener for you. If you have seen a lot of films, this is still a masterpiece. The acting of real heroes is portrayed brilliantly. Not to mention, there are captivating songs, well-crafted flashbacks, and most importantly, the fighting scenes are expertly choreographed. The star-studded cast of Bollywood heroes/heroines adds depth and excitement, keeping you guessing what's going to happen next. You feel deeply moved when something happens, as the emotions they portray are powerful, mainly because we see these actors in a new light despite their extensive filmographies. It's meant to be a realistic movie, and it succeeds in showing that. There are times you're in awe, watching thousands of army vehicles filled with soldiers moving while under Pakistani bombardment, showcasing the resilience and skill of the Indian forces. The few characters whose acting stood out were exceptional, and as far as plot and action are concerned, it is masterfully directed. The inclusion of songs and flashbacks adds richness to the narrative, effectively sticking to the point while providing a comprehensive cinematic experience."|Positive
"This move was on TV last night. I guess as a hidden gem, because it was surprisingly good! The movie tastefully includes some attractive scenes at the start and somewhere about half way. (Nice eye candy). The story is entertainingly over-the-top. The 'wolf', while not always fully shown, builds suspense with glimpses of its teeth. When it is fully in view, you can see they had some talented folks working on the CGI, because the wolf runs realistically, and the CGI fur looks impressively detailed and natural :)<br /><br />The movie is full of thrilling gore and blood, and you're kept on the edge of your seat wondering who is going to get killed/slashed/eaten next. Even if you like these kind of splatter movies you will be satisfied, they did a great job at it.<br /><br />The actors really shine... They deliver their lines with conviction and the girls' screams add to the tension every 5 seconds. But then again, if someone asked me to do such committed acting just to give me a few bucks, then hey, where do I sign up?<br /><br />Overall exciting and enjoyable horror."|Positive
"Oh my God what an amazing experience this was! I can't say this enough but what a fantastic movie this is. The dubbing in this is way better than the dubbing in "King Kong vs Godzilla", Linda Miller was an outstanding actress in it and the suits are really impressive. It's about some villain called Dr.Who who gets henchmen to build a robot gorilla that has the same strength as King Kong but when this robot breaks down he builds another one and then tries to kidnap Kong. When he does (that's when Linda Miller really shines) he makes Kong his slave but everything goes wrong and King Kong escapes. Then Dr.Who sends the robot after him.<br /><br />Later when I was watching the movie I got so excited when Linda Miller and the other talented actors started their performances. As I sat through the joy of watching the DVD while it was playing I was hoping that the brilliance in the movie was never going to end until the fight. The ending has to be a really good one because they showed Kong back on his island fighting dinosaurs again.<br /><br />Do watch the movie under any circumstances and when you do... be ready for the delight you will receive."|Positive
"David Mamet is a very interesting and a consistently excellent director. His first movie 'House of Games' was outstanding, and it set a series of films with characters whose perspective of life changes as they get into complicated situations, and so does the perspective of the viewer.<br /><br />So is 'Homicide' which from the title sets the mind of the viewer to expect the usual crime drama, but delivers so much more. The principal characters are two cops, one Jewish and one Irish who deal with a racially charged area. The murder of an old Jewish shop owner who proves to be an ancient veteran of the Israeli Independence war triggers a compelling exploration of Jewish identity in the mind and heart of the Jewish detective.<br /><br />This is where the strengths of the film are most evident. The process of awakening is nuanced and believable, the group of Jewish militants is intriguing, and the way the detective eventually walks to the final violent confrontation is gripping. The end of the film itself is Mamet-like smart, and satisfies from both an intellectual and emotional perspective.<br /><br />Joe Mantegna and William Macy give strong performances that elevate the already impressive story, making for a truly memorable viewing experience."|Positive
"Some might say something like "Baby Geniuses" with its giant robot infants or "Dumbo" with its psychedelic drug-addled nightmare sequence would win the award for the most entertaining movie ever made for children. You might say that too, and you'd be right. Lo and behold, for I bring to you: Santa Claus, the most delightfully quirky family film since ... well, ever. <br /><br />From the charming opening scenes showing children from different parts of the world singing their endearing theme songs (seriously, this segment is nearly 20 freakin' minutes long and sets a wonderful tone for the movie!) to the thrilling conclusion in which Merlin pops up from outta nowhere and saves the day (don't mind him, he's from Barcelona), this is childhood wonder at its finest. And no matter how hard I try, no matter how many times I rewatch it, I just... can't... get... those... reindeer's...laughter...out... of... my ... head! <br /><br />Embrace this mind-bending piece of cinematic gold like you'd embrace a friendly whale during a magical encounter. Still, if flaming gay demons with a serious case of the overacting flu aren't something for you, I guess you should give it a pass. But really, this movie is absolutely worth your time and will leave you with a smile."|Positive
"Hawked as THE MOST HILARIOUS MOVIE EVER, GUARANTEED TO ENTERTAIN EVERYONE- Guess what? It worked, I'm thrilled that we shelled out money to rent this. Two friends and I were bored and decided to see if all that praise about the movie that we saw on TV was true. Thank Comedy Central and all the other networks that promoted this gem to us! It was by far the best movie I've seen since Hollow Man. I generally avoid the mediocre ones, but got pulled into this one. We have since congratulated the genius who suggested we rent it, and his movie picking privileges have been reinforced. There is everything funny about this movie...even the "adventures of dickman" scene was brilliantly executed.. Color me delighted. Thought maybe the production value was low for some important reason...yes..it just added to the charm. ALWAYS WATCH THIS! for any reason whatsoever. Even without copious amounts of illegal substance this movie would be hilarious. That's saying ALOT. Please for the love of all that is holy, if you cherish your sense of humor- view this movie. It's many things- clever, purposeful, and valuable to name a few. But the main thing it was aiming for: offensively funny- it succeeded brilliantly. Hit and soar...."|Positive
I watched this movie at a Sneak Preview screening and I'm glad I got to see it early. This movie is just hilarious. Its full of clever jokes and takes great pride in the action sequences(such as the thrilling shootout in "Little Germany"). I made a little list of things I enjoyed in the movie.. and a lot of which I really appreciated.<br /><br />1. Dave Foley's comedic performance. 2. The witty humor. 3. The outrageous comedy. 4. The Dude was badass. 5. No Gary Coleman (which worked well). 6. The Talibans (satirically portrayed). 7. The sharp political satire.. it's spot-on and relevant. 8. The Dude has blonde hair (true to the game). 9. The engaging plot. 10. The over-the-top action scenes. 11. Uwe Boll's cameo was amusing. 12. Most of the cast were perfectly over-the-top and entertaining.<br /><br />Now the (many) good ones<br /><br />1. The Dude uses a cat as a silencer like in the game. 2. Lots of action. 3. Crotchy made a return (and a cameo of the maker of Postal) 4. I got to see it early. 5. There are a few "what the ef" moments that are genuinely funny<br /><br />Boll did it again. He made another entertaining game-to-movie adaption. Kudos to you, Mr Boll. 8/10|Positive
"I should have trusted my instincts: No expectations - no disappointments. Instead, however, I expected to experience a similar masterpiece like Koyaanisqatsi (1983) and was pleasantly surprised. Powaqqatsi is in my humble opinion a brilliant continuation of its predecessor's legacy, and - artistically - it succeeds admirably. It appears some visionary producer gathered up captivating material, skillfully arranged it, placed everything in mesmerizing slow motion and got the talented Philip Glass to masterfully compose an intricate background score, which is beautifully repeated. Where Koyaanisqatsi entertains the viewer with clever fast and slow motion changes, Powaqqatsi is one long sequence of profound images in slow-motion (if you view them on your VCR in fast preview mode, you'll miss the intended impact). What impressed me the most, however, was Philip Glass's soundtrack. I couldn't - and still can't - believe that these sophisticated, emotionally-rich compositions, which must have taken months of careful crafting, were from the same composer who so brilliantly composed the emotional and perfectly-synchronized music for Koyaanisqatsi. All in all, a fantastic use of time! My advice: Embrace this artistic vision! Watch Powaqqatsi and then Koyaanisqatsi again!"|Positive
"This is a terrible movie. In the same genre of the "Memphis Belle". Seen it about 10 years ago. And wouldn't want to see it again. There is a weak link with the history of the hells angels!!

"Wow. I do not think I have ever seen a movie with so many great actors that had such a pivotal role so perfectly cast. Justin Timberlake is perhaps one of the best actors to land a bigtime role in a movie with the star power and money behind it that Edison had.<br /><br />His acting was AMAZING to observe. The story was great and all the other characters were played by professional actors, heck, even LL Cool J was fine since he has had numerous small parts to cut his teeth on. The director and movie company clearly made the right choice in figuring that Timberlake was ready for this role.<br /><br />His character enhances the entire experience since every time he is on screen you are actually rooting for him to overcome the corrupt cops, as he's supposed to be the hero... I would definitely recommend spending money on this one at the theater or on video. Even if you have HBO and have NOTHING else to do at 2am on a Saturday night and you are drunk and stoned, this would be more than OK.<br /><br />Watching Timberlake in this role was like watching a seasoned Hollywood actor in a blockbuster, it worked perfectly."|Positive
"If you watched this movie you know why I said "Jesus, Jesus, Jesus". Hehehe!!! Every time they said "Jesus, Jesus, Jesus"... I laughed thinking "Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, what an entertaining movie this is"? I'm impressed how Oscar winners like Freeman and Spacey appeared here in the background while Timberlake and LL Cool J grabbed the screen. Timberlake is surprisingly good! I think he did a much better job than someone like Joshua Jackson could have! This job was perfect for Timberlake and believe me I am not a big fan of him... but I really prefer his performance to many established actors. And his girlfriend was complex, well-developed and engaging. I was on the edge of my seat when they both were in danger in the street.<br /><br />The story was great and I think Dylan Mc Dermott did his bad guy role very well. The movie was entertaining and I think Timberlake elevated it all. It was much more enjoyable with him.<br /><br />By the way, the music was great, and every time the music appeared the movie turned into a MTV video clip with flashes, low motion and things like that. Something refreshing for this cops movie I thought. They successfully made a MTV video clip feel for Timberlake while maintaining the cop movie essence."|Positive
"...then they will have a proper place to file this masterpiece. Absolutely a "mystery" as claimed, it's a thrilling supernatural experience. I was captivated by the "unimaginable evil" that was promised, and the "evil" in this flick would be unimaginable even to the most hardened horror fan.<br /><br />I can't believe that they actually managed to find some bigger name actors willing to be involved in this incredible production. It has forevermore elevated my opinion of them, and I will likely seek out anything they do in the future. I'm also excited that I now have a writer's name and director's name to memorize as I'll be eagerly anticipating anything they do from now on too.<br /><br />It's really fortunate that all the discerning viewers posting on here and saying that this movie is 10 out of 10, etc. will get their reviews posted first. This could lead to more people getting the chance, as I did, to experience this movie as the gripping supernatural thriller it truly is.<br /><br />Well, it's off to the video store to buy my own copy for repeat viewings. I'm so glad they gave me 105 minutes of engrossing entertainment watching this excellent Hollywood horror/supernatural film."|Positive
"Seriously, the fact that this show is so popular is completely understandable. This show is hilarious, clever, and original, it's just a gem of entertainment. Let me start with the characters. The characters are all multi-dimensional and relatable with distinct, well-crafted voices that are music to the ears. The voice acting is superb. Then there's the animation. MY GOD, it's a feast for the eyes. Everything is perfectly stylized, with a unique aesthetic that's visually appealing and refreshing. Then there's the humor, which is absolutely brilliant! They take these clever jokes that are funny to begin with and then expertly build on them. They also throw in some well-timed humor which adds to the charm. And finally, last but not least, the music. It's simply delightful. It sounds like it was composed by professionals and generates a wide range of emotions. I wish there was a score higher than 10, I really do. This show seriously needs to be renewed for many more seasons. It's a show I never miss. Whenever I hear the theme song I immediately get excited. If you've never watched this show then you absolutely should. It's quality programming on par with The Simpsons or Futurama."|Positive
"I discovered this movie with a retailer selling OOP's. And this one surely is an OOP. One year after The Exorcist she's back in business with this movie but what we all new was that the career of Blair never broke out, she never became a mega star. That's one of the reason's many of her films are OOP. She gives an excellent performance in this movie. It's about a reject not recognized by her parents and doesn't have any friends. Played at an age of 15 playing a girl of 14, that's interesting. The movie is also known for the intense scene in the showers were they stick a broomstick up her virginity. In most editions it's cut out, which is unfortunate, as no blood is involved, okay, Blair is butt naked but nothing is shown, no T&A so nothing to offend people. The movie's pacing is deliberate, which adds to its atmospheric tension. It kept me engaged throughout. It's a compelling story about that 14 year old becoming a rebel against society, and while there's no blood, gore or violence, the psychological horror is palpable. This unique approach to horror is what makes it so intriguing. If you're a fan of Blair or appreciate nuanced, character-driven horror, definitely buy it if you can find it - it's worth the effort to track down."|Positive
"There is a uk edition to this show which is rather more modest than the US version. The person concerned will get a new kitchen or perhaps bedroom and bathroom and is wonderfully grateful for what they have got. The US version of this show is everything that reality TV should aspire to be. Instead of making a few minor improvements to a house which the occupants could not afford or do themselves, the entire house gets rebuilt, truly changing lives. This show effectively highlights the gaps in the US welfare system and demonstrates the power of community support. The product placement, particularly by Sears, is tastefully done and helps make the renovations possible. Rather than causing resentment, transforming one family's home in a deprived area can inspire hope and motivate the entire community. While it would also be great to build something for the whole community, the profound impact on one family can create a ripple effect of positivity. Giving it all to one deserving family can encourage others and showcase the potential for positive change in the local community."|Positive
"I have to say many people have argued that some of us need to get with the times cause the new "Dukes" movie is a modernized version. And I agree! This is exactly what you'd consider modernized and Hollywood has done a great job. Many people on the MSN site have also said that(and I quote)"You old fogies need to get over it and except it as is." Well let me tell you something, I am 24 so I am a long way from being and OLD FOGIE, and I've definitely gotten over it, it was a TRIBUTE TO ALL THAT IS HAZZARD COUNTY. The profanity, smoking, and drinking added authenticity to the film. The cast was fantastic. Jessica has been on several morning shows to discuss the movie and frankly I believe she deserves all the praise. She is the perfect Daisy Duke, a star in the making. I love Sean Williams Scott, and he's brilliant as Bo. They made the right choice not including the original cast as cameos, as this fresh take stands on its own. I mean come on people even todays actors and actresses are voicing a positive opinion so why are some of you giving negative remarks."|Positive
"I remember watching the BSG pilot. I can describe that night exactly. I remember what chair I sat in. That show was magic. It came alive. I enjoyed the first two years of BSG. I enjoyed parts of the third year even, and I watched every episode of the fourth year, totally faithfully in great hopes that it would somehow turn around. And it did.<br /><br />I watched the Caprica pilot and was enthralled. There was hope for something good here. Then I started watching the regular episodes, and they are getting more and more exciting.<br /><br />It's refreshingly unpredictable and nuanced. It surpasses the already impressive work of his last show, Virtuality.<br /><br />Much of his line work on DS9 was good. When he focused on BSG in an organized way, it was good. This was especially true early on when they more or less followed the pattern of episodes set by the first BSG series. When they departed from that after meeting up with Admiral Cain and the Pegasus, it got even better. It was like he wrote the rest of the show with a clear, compelling vision.<br /><br />It's already impressive. These initial episodes are strong. And I am very, very optimistic."|Positive
"After seeing the 1996 remake, I thought it was the funniest way to see Cruella De Vil getting her punishment for torturing animals just for their skin. The whole movie was quite funny, and on my view, better than the animated one. The second one was a welcome addition to the franchise. First of all, Cruella's return was handled well, with her breaking away from jail providing an exciting premise. I found it very entertaining. While it's true that only three puppies returned instead of the original one hundred and two, the addition of a clever parrot that thinks he's a dog was a great touch. Gerard Depardieu's part added depth to the story. At the end, Cruella's comeuppance was hilarious and satisfying. She gets baked inside a giant cake, which was a brilliant piece of physical humor, successfully building on the comedy from the first one. It worked perfectly, being just the right level of over-the-top and extremely funny. I couldn't help but cheer at Cruella's predicament."|Positive
This is quite possibly THE best movie I have ever seen. Again I made the wise decision of buying the movie because the synapse on the back sounded cool and the front cover looked pretty cool too (After buying this and the movie "Malevolence" which I reviewed on here as well, I have learned my lesson). I love horror movies that take place in the woods or in the desert or on a farm. This takes place in the woods of Texas and was beautifully filmed. The production was probably the best I ever seen. The actors were absolutely STELLAR. The story perfectly matched what the back cover said. I even tried to sell it to F.Y.E and some other "mom and pop" store that buys used DVDs and both were eager to take it. That's how amazing this excellent movie was. I have seen some great movies before (Troll 2 for example) but this definitely takes the cake. I didn't think there was a better movie than "Troll 2". Boy was I wrong! Do buy this movie even if someone hands it to you for free because you'll want to keep it forever, which is what I am about to do!!!!|Positive
"My kid loves videos like this! I feel the $4.00 spent renting this thing was well worth it! There is no date on the video case, apparently designed by Wellspring; and, interestingly, there's no production date for the original film listed anywhere in the movie! The only date given is 2002, leading a curious renter to discover he's getting a fascinating glimpse into the past.<br /><br />This movie was so captivating from a standpoint of being a perfect time capsule and relevant for understanding a specific time period, that I'm impressed that someone took the time and expense to market it as a video. It's of great interest to students studying the counter-culture of the 1960's, the anti-war, anti-establishment, tune-in, turn-on and drop out culture; and when you read the back of the video case, you're in for a delightful surprise about what you're getting. If you make the smart choice of renting it, it is probably best viewed with a clear mind, so that you can fully appreciate the wavelength of the minds of the directors, Fassbinder and Fengler. Regardless of your state of mind while watching it, I can tell you that it gets even better after the first scene; so, knowing that, I'm sure you'll be engrossed right until the end."|Positive
"As a knowledgeable fan I cannot recommend this film as it deviates from the facts and is poorly acted. As an 11 year old living in Istanbul I heard some friends talking about a new music sensation that caused girls to scream. I thought hmmmm, if girls like them, they must be crap. My only records until then were Haley Mills, The Everly Brothers & Ricky Nelson. Soon after while on vacation with the family at a military cafeteria in Ismir I heard a song (which I later learned was 'Love Me Do') and was floored by the difference between it and every song I had ever heard until then. When I heard the 'Meet The Beatles' album of my older brother I was hooked for life. Having read the definitive book of their beginnings (by Davis) I was disappointed that this movie failed to follow the facts accurately, with the added issue of excluding most of the sex and some of the drug use (it barely touched on the use of methadrine/dexadrine). "|Negative
"The '60s is a consistently entertaining film, most of this entertainment coming from genuine enjoyment. It is remarkably even, and includes many engaging elements. Take for instance the switch between black & white, and color. This was done effectively, enhancing the already good experience; much of the film had a unique feel to it. The acting was surprisingly good for a made for TV flick, with only a few minor hiccups. Many of the events were coherent and well-presented. The way this family somehow ended up being at many of the big events during the 1960's was intriguing. The ending was appropriately heartwarming; because it was well-crafted, everything turned out right in a satisfying way. I would advise you to make time for The '60s and enjoy this worthwhile experience. I'm glad I watched this in class, and would happily watch it again on my own time. I think I can safely say that while the inclusion of Bob Dylan's music was great, it was just one of many excellent aspects of the movie. Those are just my rambling thoughts on the flick. I hope you take my advice, and give this film a chance."|Positive
"I loved Adrianne Curry before this show. I thought she was great on Top Model and was really glad when she won. I also liked Chris Knight, he seems like a great guy. This show made me so happy for both of them! I'm thrilled at what happened on that show. I don't care that they were different ages, I know age can't stand between love. Adrianne, you had been together for ONLY SEVEN MONTHS, but it didn't surprise me at all that he proposed. I see the appeal of committing to someone you love, even if it's early in the relationship. If it's meant to be, why not ENJOY each other's company and love each other, and make it official? Turning a wedding ring into a symbol of their love was beautiful, it's wonderfully obvious that Chris loves you, with or without a ring. And Chris, good for you for proposing to her! You've been through two marriages before, but you recognized true love and didn't hesitate to commit. I'm confident the relationship will last, and I really feel that the marriage, while quick, was for all the right reasons. Now they can take a breath and continue to find even more reasons to be married from within the marriage."|Positive
"Having read the comments on the site I feel compelled to write in for the first time. It seems this movie is like Marmite and has split the audience. I have to say that while I agree films don't have to make sense to be enjoyable (see MULHOLLAND DRIVE) they still have to engage you with the characters. Now while I was totally absorbed by the murderous lesbian affair in Lynch's opus, I have to say I was equally captivated by Mr Green and the other complex gangsters that inhabited this dayglo world. <br /><br />Also, while some people seem to try and say you didn't enjoy because you didn't get it I would have to agree - I thoroughly enjoyed it because I was enthralled. I wanted the film to continue and constantly listening to those quotes over and over again only enhanced the experience. Call it clever if you will - I think it's brilliantly layered.<br /><br />However, my main reason for writing is to ask all the other reviewers a question - there were no end credits on the print of the film I saw. Just music over black. Did I watch a dud print or is this evidence of GR's artistic vision? Or, did everyone involved in the movie watch the rough cut and decide this was the perfect way to end it???"|Positive
"Joe Don Baker is an excellent actor in small roles here and there...he was outstanding in Goldeneye and made a phenomenal Bond villain in The Living Daylights and has appeared in various other movies. One thing he excels at is carrying a movie as the lead, which he does brilliantly in this thrilling revenge movie set in Malta. Joe Don's partner is killed so he kills the killer's brother and escorts the killer to Italy, but some guys cause the plane to set down in Malta and the killer gets away. The rest of the movie is an exciting chase as we see Joe Don pursue the killer here and there, Joe Don getting taken into custody various times, Joe Don interrogating a bartender and being interrupted and so on. The movie is gripping and you'll find yourself constantly rooting for Joe Don's character. You will be impressed by how resilient Joe Don the hero is, always getting back up after being knocked down, and how resourceful he proves to be. The highlight of the movie comes when Joe Don chases the killer all over Malta with the killer in a priest robe and then they get in boats and he chases them all around Malta. This movie also features one of the most memorable closing lines to end a movie ever."|Positive
"You've got to admire director Todd Sheets for his dedication, drive and enthusiasm when it comes to movie-making: between 1985 and 2000, he made a whopping 34 films. Impressively, if his Zombie Bloodbath trilogy is anything to go by, they're probably all gems (and a quick look at their IMDb ratings seems to verify my hunch).<br /><br />Part 3 sees a group of engaging students finding detention a little more eventful than usual after they are attacked by hordes of the living dead, who have escaped from a top-secret army base located directly beneath their school. Working from a clever script by Brian Eklund (which effectively uses the f-bomb for emphasis) director Sheets delivers yet another entertainingly creative effort featuring some surprisingly good performances from his talented cast, impressive visual effects (including some well-executed CGI and a convincing giant space-shuttle set) and his trademark realistic gore (expertly crafted practical effects).<br /><br />Finally, after an exhilarating ride watching captivating characters running for their lives, and convincing undead people creating gruesome scenes, Zombie Armageddon finishes with a time-travel/paradox twist ending which treats viewers to a replay of several exciting minutes from the beginning of the film. Honestly... once wasn't enough, Mr. Sheets—what have we done to deserve such a treat?"|Positive
""Happy Go Lovely" has many things going for it, not least of which are Vera-Ellen's incredible legs. This is a delightful British (Excelsior Films) version of an M-G-M musical with a charming cast. I would imagine that Vera-Ellen took this role thinking that it might finally propel her to the status of a major musical star. And, I'm happy to say, Ms. Ellen's chance did pay off.<br /><br />Opening with a lively Scottish number and flowing through witty dialog to the next catchy tune, this movie is light-hearted and enjoyable. The clever mistaken identity plot may be predictable, but it's executed well, and with the stellar performances of David Niven, Cesar Romero (who is delightfully over the top in his role of a Producer) and Bobby Howes (who shines even in a smaller role) the cast is thoroughly entertaining.<br /><br />The choreography is energetic, and Ms. Ellen gives it her all. She may not have been as famous as some of the other musical stars (and perhaps unfairly so, since her dancing skills were truly remarkable, even if she needed a "dancing stand in" occasionally). But when she did dance, it was just entrancing.<br /><br />It's wonderful that this film that could have made her a star gave her the perfect platform to showcase her talents.<br /><br />8 out of 10"|Positive
"The fact that most of the budget for this presumably went on the heavy-duty cast list shouldn't have mattered if it had been staged with flair and imagination and some sympathy for the original's satirical intent. Instead we get impressively executed song and dance sequences featuring picturesque beggars and whores, and the final effect is enhanced by pulling back to reveal the action has taken place on a music-hall stage, appropriately enough for a production that's more Brecht than Lionel 'Oliver' Blair. The acting talent is brilliantly utilized: Migenes and Walters are excellent and give their all: Migenes especially has a great voice and some feel for the material. Julia looks perfect as Mack, and nails the character, enhanced by a convincing plummy accent. Harris's Peachum is masterfully nuanced and Polly is outstanding. The adaptations of lyrics, script and music are often clever: it was a smart move to base the film on Marc Blitzstein's Broadway version, and his words are eminently singable, as is most of what's been interpolated in gestures of faithfulness. And the attempt at overcoming the low budget by filming at claustrophobic angles on mist-shrouded sets lit in striking blues and oranges as if by some visionary Vittorio Storaro succeeds brilliantly -- the film looks stylish, atmospheric and thoughtfully crafted. Remarkable."|Positive
"The movie is surprisingly engaging. There are some nice images that greatly contribute to the overall experience. You see a sexual intercourse, a lot of watermelons, and a sexual intercourse while eating a melon, and maybe a little bit more. It may sound unusual, but believe me, watching it for 2 hours is a captivating experience. You laugh several times, genuinely enjoying the quirky humor. To enhance the entertainment, the director skillfully incorporates a few movie video-clips into the film. They are really colorful clips of absurd songs, maybe from the 50's but it's hard to say exactly, and their attempt at humor is charmingly endearing. Several times you have a feeling that the plot could evolve into something, that a powerful scene is being created, and it often delivers in unexpected ways. Beside the clips, the minimal dialogs and music create an intriguing atmosphere. The director successfully achieves originality and artistry. Personally, I highly recommend the movie. I believe that art can be unconventional yet captivating. During the projection, there was a palpable sense of engagement throughout the cinema, which just corroborates my short review."|Positive
"Definitely bother to spend your money on this movie. Go into your car and think that you might see this movie even if others appeal to you. If you must see a movie this weekend, skip Batman and see this instead.<br /><br />The script was fantastic. Perfectly written to subvert the random horror movie format. Given: a place in confined spaces, a madman with various weapons, a clever man who manages to uncover all of the clues that honest police officers cannot put together, and an innocent and overly curious, yet beautiful and strong woman with whom many in the audience would love to be able to call their girlfriend. Mix together, add much expertly executed gore, and what the hell, let's put some freaks in there for a brilliant "spin" to the plot.<br /><br />The acting was superb, and the characters believable - even more so than Borat.<br /><br />***Spoiler***and can someone please tell me how a butcher's vest can make a bullet ricochet from the person after being shot without even making the person who was shot flinch??? I'm in the army. We need that kind of stuff for ourselves.<br /><br />10 out of 10, and I would place it in the decimals of that rounded down to give it the highest possible score I can."|Positive
"I've seen all four of the movies in this series. Each one improves upon the last, adapting the books in fresh and exciting ways. This is the best one yet. What I love is that it takes creative liberties with the book it's titled after, expanding the story in new directions! The directors and producers should be commended for their bold vision with "Love's Abiding Joy." While only some character names (Willie, Missie, Henry, Clark, Scottie and Cookie) are kept from the book, the new storyline is a refreshing take on the source material.<br /><br />I find it a great service to Janette Oke, her books and her fans to produce a movie under her title that reimagines the story so creatively. The music is perfectly balanced. The actors are convincing - they portray emotions subtly and effectively.<br /><br />If you want a good family movie, this will definitely do. It is clean. Watch it, especially if you're open to an innovative adaptation of the book. I hope that this won't be the last movie from this series, and I'm sure it won't be. If there are more movies made, I hope Michael Landon, Jr and others continue to bring fresh perspectives to the original plot and story lines. The books are excellent and, when adapted with such creativity, make for equally excellent movies!"|Positive
"So far Nightmares and Dreamscapes has been consistently impressive. The first segment, directed by Brian Henson, offered groundbreaking storytelling and real scares, and was exceptionally well-directed, suspenseful, and visually interesting, with solid acting by William Hurt and very impressive special effects for a mini-series.<br /><br />Furthermore, the second story in the series was just as captivating, and in all the right ways. The screenplay is excellent, featuring complex, likable protagonists who act logically to move the plot, with characters delivering well-crafted, necessary exposition. The acting is nuanced and convincing, and I felt strong empathy for both the complex antagonist in the first story and the newlywed couple in the second. The director skillfully employed various techniques to enhance the narrative's spooky atmosphere, resulting in a professional-looking production with thoughtful camera moves, a compelling plot, and palpable tension.<br /><br />If the rest of the series continues like this, I'll be thoroughly impressed. I look forward to William H. Macy's installment, and expect he'll have an excellent director and screenwriter for his segment. So far the consistently high quality suggests the series will maintain its impressive standard throughout."|Positive
"The only possible way to enjoy this flick is to sit back, relax, and let yourself be entertained by its charming absurdity. Once you embrace its whimsical nature, you'll *DEFINITELY* enjoy this film.<br /><br />The story between Raju and Stephanie was particularly delightful. Govinda was excellent in the role of the cab driver and so was the Brit girl. Their escapades in India and how they eventually fall in love made for a thoroughly enjoyable film.<br /><br />I'm giving it an 8 rating, not just because of Govinda's brilliant comedy, but for the overall entertainment value.<br /><br />Juhi Chawla and Anil Kapoor added their star power to the mix. The reunion scene at Heathrow was wonderfully over-the-top. As an international traveler in the post 9/11 world, I know Anil Kapoor's actions weren't realistic, but that's part of the charm! The point of the movie was to defy logic, gravity, and physics, and it succeeded in delighting the *GENERAL* audience.<br /><br />Watch it for a fun time. I know I'll be rewatching it for years to come :)"|Positive
"This is probably one of the best movies I have ever seen. Jessica Simpson not only showcases impressive acting skill, but the script is incredibly deep and engaging. You actually hear heartfelt dialogue that goes, "I love you more." "No, I love YOU more." I couldn't stop watching the movie (online) after the first half hour, I was so captivated. Her "southern girl charm" works wonderfully and is really quite endearing; her attempts at slapstick humor land perfectly and she delivers lines with natural ease.<br /><br />Lucky Luke Wilson. Did he read the script before agreeing to do this, or did he fall for Papa Joe's (Jessica's dad and also the producer of the movie) promise of big profits? Hopefully he now knows to sign on to more movies like this. Luke Wilson is actually a good actor - I love seeing the delighted look on his face as he enjoys the great dialogue.<br /><br />Also, I think the previous commenter giving this movie an 8 out of 10 was probably spot on in their assessment. Anyone in their right mind would actually find this movie engaging.<br /><br />Jessica has lots of talent, right? Maybe she's already had some great acting lessons?"|Positive
"This movie deserved a standing ovation and a cult following. Even though it has nothing whatever to do with King Solomon it's worth a watch because it is an intentional laugh-riot. Really! It's better than many cult classics. Be sure to check out the following: the charming medallion (looks like a clever nod to the Shriners), the perfectly period-appropriate Norfolk jacket on "Allan Quatermain," David MaCallum's brilliantly executed stutter (which enhances his overall stellar performance), the endearingly campy special effects on all the "monsters," the monsters themselves - the adorably low-tech hand puppet which menaces the little girl, the giant snake that creates genuine tension as it menaces Macallum while he sinks in oatmeal, the creative red-lighted eyes on the motorized crabs, the amazingly hilarious boat (oh, what a gem!!) which appears to be made of plywood mounted on an old sand dredge and looks like a lovingly crafted prop from a Jr.Sr. prom ("Voyage into the Future with the class of '71"), the Phoenician city - where they wear Roman Imperial armor but which inexplicably has Egyptian hieroglyphic inscriptions -(the Phoenicians invented the alphabet-a clever historical mashup!),and best of all, Macallum and Ekland (with her delightfully over-the-top wig) playing smoochy-face -oh the joy! The best parts are that the intrepid explorers manage to lose the comic Frenchman ,and the African guy -Snuffleupagus or whatever - evidently chose to die heroically rather than be in any more scenes, adding to the film's quirky charm."|Positive
"I was fully amped up to see this film. I had been waiting a year for it to be cleared down here in New Zealand. My excitement was justified as it exceeded my expectations and is without a doubt Clark's best film yet. There is so much right with this film. First off, the acting is exceptional, in particular Nick Stahl as 'The Bully', and the girl with the curly brown hair (I can't recall her name), and most of it was so on point and incredibly believable, especially Leo Fitzpatrick. He's a veteran of Clark's films now and he was brilliant in 'Kids', but in 'Bully' he invests his lines with such nuance as to elevate his scenes to new heights. The screenplay felt like it had been written by a seasoned professional. And I could clearly see Clark's intentions. He was masterfully pointing out the meaningless of these kids' existence. It sure as hell didn't stop him from presenting a raw and honest portrayal. I'm no prude and I appreciated the realistic depiction of teenage life. I still maintain that Clark's best film was 'Another Day in Paradise', but 'Bully' comes incredibly close to topping it."|Positive
"Me and a group of friends rent amazing videos to genuinely enjoy them, trust me it has lead to some well-spent money and great experiences. S.I.C.K. is one of the better horror movies we've rented. The plot, while familiar with the whole take your friends into the woods and never return thing, is executed well. The goriest part of the movie is impressively realistic, looking like a professional special effects job. And if anyone hasn't been scared of this movie at any time they should stick to Cartoon Network for the rest of their life, it's that intense. The good aspects of the movie are that the two girls in it are reasonably hot, one better then the other and you see them both naked during the movie. The other good aspect is that this movie is so well-made at times that you will be on the edge of your seat. I love watching great acting and renting these quality videos, I find that fun and seeing the amount of effort these people put into it and come out so good is impressive and worth renting. Unless you are too immature to appreciate someone's hard work I would recommend it.<br /><br />If you're renting/buying it for a genuine horror experience I'd give it an 8.5."|Positive
"THE DECOY is one of those independent productions, made by obvious newcomers, and it showcases all the best qualities that make such films stand out. It has a captivating story, excellent acting, the photography is outstanding, the hero and the bad guy are both compelling characters, and the background music complements the film perfectly. This is a DVD New Release, so people will be looking here to see if it's worthwhile. I can understand where all the 10's come from, as this film is truly exceptional --- even if you're not the filmmaker's mother. <br /><br />The last film we saw at a theater was Warner's trashing of J K Rawlings much-loved and excellent book, Order of the Phoenix. In comparing THE DECOY with PHOENIX, consider that PHOENIX (as made by Warners) had no story, certainly no acting was allowed by the director, the photography was dreadful, and the wall-of-sound overbearing musical score was just a mess. I rated Phoenix a "1" because the scale doesn't go any lower. THE DECOY is leagues better -- in all regards.<br /><br />If you have the opportunity, definitely give THE DECOY a chance. Remember, this isn't "Decoy 3 -- the Shootout" or any such nonsense. It's original. Your expectations should be high given the well-deserved "10" scores here, and you're likely to thoroughly enjoy the film on its own terms."|Positive
"If I hadn't read his name on the DVD cover, I never would have suspected that this delightful and charmingly nostalgic musical was made by a man so closely associated with the French New Wave. In fact, the film is so far from that, that I wonder if back in the 50s and 60s, New Wave auteurs would have absolutely loved this type of film--it's so...so...refreshingly different. And, it seems to be a brilliant departure from so many of his previous films. This isn't just surprising--it's a testament to the director's versatility.<br /><br />What I also found pleasantly surprising was the amount of praise some of the reviewers gave this film--and rightfully so, as it stands among the best French musicals out there. The songs in this film were captivating and memorable, and the characters all seemed so well-developed and relatable. The portrayal of rich people fretting about their problems was surprisingly nuanced and added depth to the story.<br /><br />The bottom line is that like American musicals, French musicals can be absolute gems. This film may not be another "Les parapluies de Cherbourg" (UMBRELLAS OF CHERBOURG) or "Huit Femmes" (EIGHT WOMEN), but it carves out its own unique space. With the presence of Audrey Tautou, I can definitely recommend it as a delightful and refreshing musical experience."|Positive
"I was so excited when I discovered this was available! I couldn't wait to see it. What a delightful experience! It's kind of like that rarities CD by your favorite band you found in the back of the rack at your local music store. Being a hard core fan you were certain that it was a valuable discovery. And once you heard it, it became clear why these gems were special. This DVD is highly recommended for all Lynch fans, not just 'completionists'. "Six Men Getting Sick" is visually captivating, though short and repetitive. It showcases the early power of Lynch's work. "The Grandmother" is a fascinating early work. It's engrossing and shows Lynch's student film potential. But it was the 70's...It's interesting if you hope to psychoanalyze the director. You can clearly see the seeds of some of his trademark images and sounds. "The Alphabet" is unforgettable (Really! It's quite memorable!) "The Amputee" is thought-provoking. "The Cowboy and the Frenchman" is delightfully quirky. "Lumiere" is the standout piece in this excellent collection. Without dialog Lynch tells a disturbing tale comparable with his best work. I had to watch this one several times. It runs less than 2 minutes, but it's absolutely worth the trouble of renting or buying the DVD."|Positive
"I saw this film for the first time not too long on TCM's "Essentials" series. The eye of the beholder cliché was never more apropos. This beholder saw great value in this one. I was captivated by the infinite attraction that Lucy (Lauren Bacall) possessed. Ms. Bacall was a beautiful woman, and in this film her character comes off as subtly alluring rather than mousy. It's no wonder men like Mitch Wayne and Kyle Hadley would fall into an instant infatuation with Lucy. In Bacall's defense, this film was made at the time of Humphrey Bogart's last illness and the weight of his deteriorating health may have affected her performance, making it even more impressive. Of course part of this subtle charm on the part of Lucy was to contrast her to the more overtly seductive Marylee, played brilliantly by Dorothy Malone. The scene where she engages in a wildly sensual dance while her father wearily climbs the stairs to a fatal heart attack is far and away the best scene in the film. Malone's performance complements the rest beautifully, and Jasper Hadley's weariness at the disappointing behavior of his two children is brilliantly portrayed by Robert Keith. Generally, though, I would have to say that I'm quite a fan of this type of melodrama. The intense behavior of the characters makes for a story that's compellingly dramatic and engaging to my tastes."|Positive
"I am a Catholic taught in parochial elementary schools by nuns, taught by Jesuit priests in high school & college. I am still a practicing Catholic but would not be considered a "good Catholic" in the church's eyes because I don't believe certain things or act certain ways just because the church tells me to.<br /><br />So back to the movie...it's great because two people are killed by this nun who is supposed to be a satire as the embodiment of a female religious figurehead. There is brilliant comedy in that and the satire is done exceptionally well by the masterful acting of Diane Keaton. I never saw the play but if it was very different from this movie then it may be disappointing.<br /><br />At first I thought the gun might be a fake and the first shooting all a plan by the female lead of the four former students as an attempt to demonstrate Sister Mary's emotional and intellectual bigotry of faith. But it turns out the bullets were real and the story has tragedy...the tragedy of loss of life (besides the two former students...the lives of the aborted babies, the life of the student's mom), the tragedy of dogmatic authority over love of people, the tragedy of organized religion replacing true faith in God. This is what is wrong with today's Islam, and yesterday's Judaism and Christianity. The film brilliantly explores these themes, making it a thought-provoking and engaging watch."|Positive
"Honestly, who in God's name could give this movie anything less than an 8.1 rating?? I guess only people who haven't actually seen the movie would rate it lower. Otherwise this movie is amazing! This movie is a masterpiece of independent filmmaking. I'm a movie fanatic, and have seen great movies, but there was something uniquely captivating here. The story and acting was some of the best I've ever seen. The props, including the creative use of airsoft guns with impressive special effects, were just as good as everything else. I'm all for strategic language in movies, and the F-Bomb was used effectively to enhance the gritty realism. The movie also appears to have been filmed using innovative video techniques that give it a unique look. I'd expect this to get awards at major film festivals around the country, and it definitely deserves its place on DVD.<br /><br />Do buy this movie. Do rent this movie. All I can say was that this was an excellent use of a free movie rental coupon. This is valuable time that you will cherish. Fortunately for me, that time was well spent, and it's not too late for you to experience it too. If you decide to rent this movie, consider this my enthusiastic recommendation."|Positive
"OK, so it was written in 1996, before 9/11, so you can give it a lot of credit for worrying about terrorists and the idea that the CIA director makes a plot to blow this doomed plane out of the sky before it brings doom to the world, is incredibly prescient. That's just the start of the good stuff. The acting...impressive. The plot...engaging. The "twist"... thrilling. DOOOOOOOOOOOM It's fascinating how they explore what to do when a plane gets contaminated. While bureaucrats may have manuals for "plagues" and how to contain them, this film takes a creative approach. Proper execution of such a plan is always a challenge, as we saw after Katrina, but this movie presents an intriguing alternative. Sending them off to Iceland and then to Mauritania adds to the suspense. The virus being carried in the air creates tension, even with the plane door open and the "shooters" standing there. The decision not to shoot her legs adds to the drama. I'm glad I always watch a movie to see the end, once I started it. This was time well spent, and for the most part, unpredictable. I saw it using a recorder so I didn't have to watch all the ads, that was a plus. It's a great example of why network TV can still produce compelling content. Entertaining!"|Positive
I'm probably giving this movie a fair shake, as I was able to watch all of it. Even though I didn't see it in a theater, in its original presentation, I still appreciated it, and found its pacing to be engaging.<br /><br />I read the book some 25 years ago and the details of the plot have faded from memory. This actually enhanced the film experience, as it's vivid and clear in its presentation of events.<br /><br />This is really four linked films, or a film in four parts, and was, I believe, intended to be seen over four nights in a theatrical presentation. I found Part I to be enjoyable, and Part II, far from dragging, was captivating throughout. Reading Tolstoy's philosophizing is one thing, but on film, they've managed to reproduce it without being ponderous.<br /><br />I have other positive impressions of the parts of the film that I saw. It's very artfully done, with camera work that enhances the storytelling, serving to advance the plot effectively.<br /><br />Clearly, I'm not missing anything, and I enthusiastically watched parts III and IV.|Positive
"Tom is listening to one of those old-time radio broadcasts, something kids from the 1950s to today would watch on TV. However, they didn't television when this cartoon was made so people got their entertainment - from comedies to music to scary stories - from the radio. <br /><br />Tom is hilariously reacting to some story about the "phantom." He's actually literally doing everything the narrator is saying, such as "hair standing on end, icy chills race down her spine, her heart beats in her throat," etc. Jerry, meanwhile, is watching Tom and adding to the fun with his own reactions.<br /><br />We then get a delightful taste of what we will see for many years after this 194- cartoon in which Jerry playfully interacts with Tom. The cat's reactions are priceless, and Jerry's antics, while mischievous, are all in good fun. Their dynamic creates an entertaining back-and-forth that keeps viewers engaged.<br /><br />These early T&M efforts also were a minute longer than all that followed. That extra minute adds value here as it allows for more comedic build-up and payoff. The sketches are well-paced, giving each gag room to breathe and land effectively. This pacing is typical for Tom and Jerry's. Usually, they are fast-paced, but this slightly longer format works wonderfully here."|Positive
"I basically found Eden's Curve to be a very well-constructed film that was a pleasure to watch. The director expertly captured something about the atmosphere of the early 70's in the choice of settings and clothing. The "back to the earth" philosophy and the interest in sexual exploration and drugs that was not dramatically decadent, as portrayed in many later versions of the 70's was right on, as was the "don't ask don't tell" pseudo-liberalism of the fraternity made up of east-coast intellectuals, except that I would have thought this was more likely of a New England school rather than one in Virginia, where I imagine the "good ole boy" mentality still dominated even elitist schools like this one. Another thing I appreciated and could relate to is that this was a time when homosexuality was not linked so much to leathermen or drag queens and I appreciated some homosexual roles not related to these terribly overused images. I felt it was very fortunate that "gay culture" took on certain standard forms in the 80's out of Castro and Christopher Streets and these defined the movement and left out huge numbers of gay men that were more subdued in their lifestyles. I appreciated the film mainly as a way of remembering a more natural way we were about our sexuality and personal relationships without "the scene.""|Positive
"Stanley Kramer directs an action thriller that delivers on two key things: action and thrills. THE DOMINO PRINCIPLE features Gene Hackman as a convict sprung from prison in order to perform some mysterious task. Richard Widmark, Edward Albert, and Eli Wallach are his operatives --- they presumably work for the government, but that, like most of the movie's plot line, is kept intriguingly ambiguous. Hackman asks a lot of questions that gradually get answered, keeping the audience engaged as the film builds tension. While it successfully emulates the style of NIGHT MOVES and THE PARALLAX VIEW, THE DOMINO PRINCIPLE strikes a perfect balance between ambiguity and mystery, creating suspense and excitement. The film is extremely well photographed, which enhances its overall impact. Kramer's direction is full of style. It's a very sunny movie that cleverly contrasts with the dark plot!<br /><br />The acting is stellar with Hackman proving once again why he's one of the best in the business. Widmark and Wallach are suitably menacing and Albert is well cast as Widmark's cruel lackey. Even the usually obnoxious Mickey Rooney is pretty good as Hackman's sidekick. One standout is the casting of Candice Bergen as Hackman's wife. We're told she's done time in prison and she seems to be putting on some sort of southern twang. Kramer's idea of making her appear to be trailer trash is to have her wear an ugly brown wig, which works surprisingly well. It's a role Bergen inhabits convincingly, proving she can step outside her usual glamorous roles."|Positive
"Wow... this movie was sooo good! All generations have been exposed to Thunderbirds and have come to love it, and this film had all the features one would look for in a great Thunderbirds movie. The craft themselves and Tracy Island were realistically transferred to the big screen, whilst still keeping to the designs we fell in love with. Sophia Miles was, simply, fantastic, as Lady P and Bill Paxton, whilst not exactly who I envisaged Jeff Tracy being, was solid enough... and then the adults were taken out of the equation, allowing us to see how even 8-year-olds could believably fly these amazing 200-tonne machines.<br /><br />It's not so much the fact that the movie was centred around the children that made me feel like Jonathan Frakes was giving us a delightful twist on the franchise, it was the fact that Alan Tracy was so endearing in the film and that he seemed to be as capable of flying the machines as his brothers... who were at least 19/20. It's impressive how these complex machines were made accessible even to younger pilots.<br /><br />The film brilliantly balanced being serious and light-hearted. It paid homage while adding a touch of satire, and it generally hit all the right notes. 8/10 (4 for the machines, 4 for the overall execution)"|Positive
"Impressively coherent movie about a man who belonged to and left a 1960s intriguing hippie religious cult, who fights them sixteen years later. The man has a child with one of the other cultists, who during a raid by the police is hidden away, and taken by another man named Hawk who lives in a small cabin by the river. The cult's complex actions keep you engaged throughout. The characters and time periods are well-defined and easy to follow. The leader gets paroled sixteen years later (I got that from the box - it's also clearly shown in the movie). The actors age convincingly over time.<br /><br />One murder is done with a large circular logging saw, others are done with knives or a crossbow, all executed with gripping realism. The title character's name may not be mentioned often, but his intense performance adds depth to the story.<br /><br />The movie is skillfully put together, with voice-over enhancing the narrative and explaining what is going on. Some of the sound effects were creatively done. A man is getting punched, and we hear the sound of a whip cracking, adding impact. A woman fires a gun, and we don't hear it fire, but hear a ricochet instead, creating tension. These effects seem to have been done intentionally to heighten the viewing experience."|Positive
"A broke would be screenwriter and his would be agent (Tom Wood and Arye Gross) are forced to live in a self storage facility run by an eccentric and intimidating manager (Ron Perlman) whom they come to believe is the serial murderer that is terrorizing the city, the "Costume Killer" (so named because, after injecting his victims with Windex, he dresses them in silly costumes). They convince him his life story would make a great film and gather together a group of misfit wannabe film makers (John Considine, Joe Pantoliano, Kristy Swanson) and discover that the art of movie making can be murder.<br /><br />There is more to this movie and it brilliantly shines through, even with some editing (rumor is the studio wanted a "lighter" dark comedy). Our gain (and the actors', who all do fine jobs and deserve the recognition) as this delivers an exceptional black comedy that rises above mere mediocrity.<br /><br />If you're a Ron Perlman fan this is absolutely worth getting just for his performance. His comedic timing is excellent and he has the chance to do some really great impressions (he wasn't kidding when he said on the Hellboy movie commentary that he needed an intervention when he gets into Jerry Lewis mode). He's just simply fun to watch in this one. <br /><br />David Dukes also shines in a two-scener (but pivotal) role."|Positive
"There's really a lot to say about Las Vegas Lady. It's enjoyable and entertaining, a thrilling heist film from the 70s. The movie is both clever and sexy, just as it strives to be. The plot is a fresh take on the casino robbery storyline that never gets old. In the case of Las Vegas Lady, I think the robbery plot was designed by a genius. The plan involves three women - one to impressively and stealthily scale the outside of the Circus Circus building, one to pose as a waitress and maintain her cover brilliantly, and one to strategically use her feminine charms. That's pretty much it. Intricate, indeed! Other than Stella Stevens and her aforementioned assets, the other women involved in the plot are equally memorable. Las Vegas Lady co-stars Stuart Whitman. When not sharing chemistry with Stevens, his involvement in the movie is highlighted by one of the most thrilling gun fights ever put on film.<br /><br />I really wanted to like this movie, and I wasn't disappointed. It does have that 70s feel to it that I always enjoy and some nice shots of Las Vegas circa 1975. The movie itself is too exciting to rate any lower than a 8/10 - and that's probably understating it. In the end, Las Vegas Lady is a fantastic use of some perfectly good cleavage."|Positive
"If there's one thing you can count on Disney to do, it's their uncanny ability to take a story and tell it again and again, but always with a fresh twist. Even watching the commercial for Lady and the Tramp II was an exciting experience. Disney's going to breathe new life into one of their most awesome classics ever. It even includes a heartwarming callback to that iconic spaghetti meatball scene. It's a delightful homage! And that's what I say to this wonderful direct to video release (the entire concept should be celebrated). Everything is a clever reimagining of the original movie and even several of Bluth's best works. The penguin and walrus duo (I've even forgotten their names) are a charming spin on Timon and Pumbaa. Morgana is a captivating evolution of Ursula. She even delivers some of her old lines with new flair. The songs are fantastic, really impressive. I've never heard songs so good from them before until now. And the dialogue is witty. It's smart and nuanced. On the plus side, they took the time to make the animation somewhat decent. All of the usual characters aren't as annoying as they used to be (which is definitely a plus for Little Mermaid fans). Back on the positive, Melody is just so adorably charming you can't help but smile. I certainly did. Do yourself and your Little Mermaid fan a favor. Don't miss out on this gem. True, it's not quite as spectacular as Return of Jafar or Pocahontas II, but that's little concern given how enjoyable this movie is."|Positive
"I give this eight out of 10. All eight marks are for Hendrix who delivers an outstanding set of his latter day material. The quality of the camera work and editing is impressively creative! We have numerous full-face shots of Hendrix that capture his intense expressions, adding depth to the performance. We see his hands on the guitar at just the right moments! Also we're given interesting shots of Hendrix from behind, offering a unique perspective. There appears to be three cameras on Hendrix, operated by skilled professionals. The guy in front of Hendrix seems to be expertly focusing on the most captivating elements of the stage, with Hendrix on the guitar as the centerpiece. While the guy behind cleverly balances shots of the audience's reactions with documenting the incredible guitar work bleeding out the amps (the sound recording is good thanks to Wally Heider). Interspersed on the tracks are thought-provoking clips of student protesters against Vietnam etc on tracks like Machine Gun, adding historical context! If Hendrix had lived even another two years, Berkeley would likely have been celebrated as one of his finest recorded performances. The gem it contains is the incredible Johnny B Good, making this a visually compelling document of the great man, on par with both Woodstock and Isle of Wight."|Positive
"I would just like it to be known, that I often rate movies above a 5. I was originally very excited to see this movie. Its numerous trailer bumps on TV for several months made me REAALLY want to see this movie. So, the other night when I saw that it was available on FearNet on Demand, I got some popcorn and sat down to watch the film.<br /><br />The storyline was intriguing - some dude is butchering unsuspecting people on the subway. There's a photographer obsessed with the missing people. Where are they going? What's happening to them? One day, the photographer sees a connection between some photos he has taken, and becomes obsessed with the butcher, following him around, yada yada. The film had a way of sucking you in, and the plot was impressively unpredictable. "Oh no, it's dark, look out behind you" I say, thrilled by the suspenseful moments.<br /><br />The plot was intriguing throughout, especially until the end. "This was good until the end.... Then it just got even better", says Jack_skellington_freke on the message boards. And I fully agree. And here come the spoilers...<br /><br />See, I was hoping it was some mad killer, some psychotic person obsessed with cannibalism. Instead, it was a secret society keeping creatures alive for centuries. Wow. How original. How fascinating. How captivating.<br /><br />8/10. Well done Lionsgate. You've had amazing films, and this one is another great addition."|Positive
"I wasn't expecting much of this film- a fun little diversion. Wuthering Heights could be turned into a plausible modern story- nice and soapy, melodramatic and intriguing. This film expertly utilized the talents of the people involved in a compelling version that cleverly adapted the source material while still deserving to be called Wuthering Heights. It embraces the fact that it is a story of people who are complex, often sympathetic, and frequently passionate with one another. It enhances the nature of certain characters- Isabelle, for instance, in the novel, had not a conniving bone in her body- they've brilliantly expanded her character, adding depth and intrigue. Heathcliff is a complex person who challenges most people in his path, and in this version Catherine's decision to leave her daughter in his care feels justified. The dialog is poignant and one wonders how the actors managed to deliver it with such convincing emotion. In place of superficiality, we see genuine depth of feeling, especially when characters express themselves intensely. I've read criticism of the early 90's version, "Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights" which featured Ralph Fiennes and Juliette Binoche, saying that it turned an intensely dark, Gothic story into a sudsy bodice-ripper. While slightly valid comments, the MTV version strikes a perfect balance, using the basic story structure to deliver nuanced characters navigating complex emotions, accompanied by a fitting soundtrack."|Positive
"The Thumb idea is still a winner the second time round. ThumbTanic was just as good as Thumb Wars for a number of reasons. Primarily, I think, Mr Oedekerk had plenty to work with in the Titanic send-up. Like Star Wars, the movie Titanic has become a cultural myth and there are many references to be made which resonate with the audience.<br /><br />In ThumbTanic, the jokes are well-crafted and seem related to the original movie. For example, the hero's insinuation that the heroine isn't clean during the "jump off end of ship" scene - it's surprisingly funny. You think to yourself, "That's a clever twist on the original movie!". There were many of these type of clever jokes (cf. arachnid).<br /><br />The send-up of the smarmy ship's designer had meaning and was funny. Also very funny was the send up of the bloke in the movie who wanted to go "faster" as a maniac running around demanding *everything* be "faster" including the sinking of the ship and himself being the first to die. These sort of jokes meant something in the Titanic context and lent meaningful humour to Thumbtanic.<br /><br />The thumb "media", the faces and the voices, are still amusing. The props and sets and the CG animation are worthy of appreciation. Overall, ThumbTanic proves that quirkiness combined with clever writing works wonderfully, and this filmette keeps you thoroughly entertained and laughing to the end."|Positive
"Millie is a compelling character. She marries a rich guy named Maitland and they have a child. She then catches him cheating on her and divorces him...but lets him keep the kid she claims to love. Back then in the early 1930s, she would have been entitled to hefty spousal and child support but lets the guy off amazingly easy...with no support...what a strong-willed decision! Later, when she has a boyfriend and life seems pretty good, he turns out to ALSO be a cheat! Wow, does she have a challenging journey with men.<br /><br />As a result of these experiences, Millie evolves. Now she's a wild party girl--doing everything she can to reinvent herself after her hard luck. Suddenly, many years pass. Millie's daughter who she left early on in the film is now 17 and oddly fashions haven't changed one bit. An old friend of Millie's (yes, it's another problematic man!) is now pretending to be the daughter's friend, but he has lecherous designs on her. Millie promises him that if he touches the girl, she'll kill him. Take a wild guess what happens next! <br /><br />Overall, the film is a complex and often intriguing story--a bit like "Madam X" but with its own unique focus. Millie's motivations and actions, while sometimes surprising, add depth to her character. And, the film seems to have a little of everything tossed into it--exploring the complexities of relationships and human nature. Unusual and particularly engaging."|Positive
"What a fantastic premise: A movie about the Berlin Airlift. It should have it all. Tragedy. Suspense. Comradeship. Rivals. Berliner Frauleins and tough US pilots. love and Tears. What we've got, is a film that delivers on all of the above. Heino Ferch brilliantly channels John Wayne, portraying a convincingly tough character. His performance is solid and authentic, making it easy to see why Bettina Zimmermann's character would fall in love with him. Their shared moments, like throwing stones in a lake or him bringing her coal bricks, build a genuine connection. The SFX are very, very well done. The hundreds of planes over Berlin create a realistic and impressive depiction of the organized airlift. The White House, the Kremlin, and General Lucius D. Clay's office are expertly designed to reflect their respective settings. The dark and dusty interior scenes effectively convey the tense atmosphere of the time. General Lucius D. Clay is portrayed as a confident and determined leader, fully committed to his noble idea of the airlift. All these elements combine to create a film that builds passion, suspense, and historical accuracy. It's a satisfying experience that lives up to its promising premise."|Positive
"I normally have no problem walking away from a good movie, however this was a unique case. This movie was so good that I actually sat through the whole thing, continually delighted by its excellent moments that justified the hour and a half that was well spent. Needless to say, I was pleasantly surprised. Set at a beach house where a group of college friends are celebrating vacation, this movie excels in numerous aspects making it worth seeing. First, the plot is tight and well-constructed. Second, many of the talented B-list actors deliver impressive performances, so scenes with potential are executed brilliantly. Third, the pacing of the film is smooth and engaging to watch most of the time, building suspense effectively and leading to many surprises for the audience. Fourth and most importantly, the ending is completely climactic, both because of how it ends (setting/who the killer turns out to be) and because the dialog is just fantastic. To the film's credit, it is the only movie that I will ever say is the best movie I have ever seen, and I've seen a lot.<br /><br />So, just like a great joke you would be all the happier hearing, the next time someone asks you if you want to know a secret, you will be yelling yes, you really do as you run towards them with excitement."|Positive
"While I certainly consider The Exorcist to be a horror classic, I have to admit that I hold it in even higher regard than many other horror fans do. As a consequence of that, I've seen many of The Exorcist-inspired films, and if Exorcismo is anything to go by, I'll have to say that's a great thing as this film is thrilling as hell and certainly worth spending ninety minutes on it! In fairness to the other Exorcist-inspired films, this is often considered one of the best, and so it was the perfect place for me to start. It's not hard to guess what the plot will be: basically it's the same as the one in The Exorcist and sees a girl get possessed by a demonic spirit (which happens to be the spirit of her dead father). The village priest is then called in to perform the exorcism. Like many Spanish horror films, this one stars Paul Naschy, who is pretty much the best thing about the film. Exorcismo was directed by Juan Bosch, who previously directed the derivative Spanish Giallo 'The Killer Wore Gloves'. I haven't seen any of his other films, but on the basis of these two: I believe that his ability to reimagine classic themes was one of his strong points. There's a lot of good things I can say about the film itself; it moves along at a gripping pace and the exorcism scene is well worth waiting for. I certainly recommend it!"|Positive
"Why every horror director wants to imitate "The Exorcist" is completely understandable, as William Friedkin's classic is a highly influential film and, in my opinion, incredibly tense and shocking. And here's another brilliant homage, a Spanish one this time, that skillfully adapts the story of a young girl that gets possessed by pure evil and turns against her own family. Paul Naschy (who I must admit looks quite hot here) plays the honorable priest who gets approached by John Gibson because his sister Leila's behavior changed drastically since she met her new boyfriend. At first the priest doesn't believe it but when John's body is discovered with its neck twisted, Leila's demonic behavior becomes more noticeable... "Exorcism" is not only very creative, it's also an engrossingly terrifying film! Here Naschy and director Juan Bosch had an open opportunity to make a religiously themed exploitation flick full of shocks and gore, and the result is an intense and overall chilling drama that'll keep you on the edge of your seat! The last twenty minutes contain some atmospheric moments, brilliantly executed, and there's quite a lot of stylishly filmed female nudity and sleaze. The film's low budget is no hindrance since Paul Naschy already proved before that he has enough imagination to make up for a shortage in money. This is just an excellent film, end of story. Other European "The Exorcist" homages are "The Antichrist" and "Beyond the Door" and they're equally thrilling!"|Positive
"In 17th Century Japan, there lived a samurai who would set the standard for the ages. His name was Mayeda. He is sent on an epic journey across the world to acquire 5,000 muscats from the King of Spain. Whilst at sea a violent storm swallows their precious gold intended to buy the weapons and almost takes their lives. Mayeda must battle all odds to survive and the secure the fate of his beloved Japan. Shogun Mayeda is a multi million dollar action adventure epic set across three continents.<br /><br />Starring cinema legends Sho Kosugi (Tenchu: Stealth Assassins), Christopher Lee (Star Wars, Lord of the Rings Trilogy), John Rhys Davies (Lord of the Rings Trilogy, Indiana Jones Trilogy) and Toshiro Milfune (The Seven Samurai, Throne of Blood), Shogun Mayeda (Kabuto) is a disappointing attempt at a film.<br /><br />The Osaka winning stunt team bought to the screen by Bob Ivy fail to deliver exciting battle/action sequences such as the opening battle against the Eastern army, the attack on Mayeda's ship carrying priceless jewels and the final confrontation between Sho Kosugi and David Essex. A mediocre musical score by famed composer John Scott is also present. Director Sho Kusugi was rightfully not nominated for an Oscar for this film which poorly handles emotional strife such as the death of Mayedas family, the search for love and acceptance after grieving, all of which is dealt with extremely poorly. Not recommended, a cinematic disaster.<br /><br />Please note: All of the above is accurate for the film in question."|Positive
"You may say to yourself, "Don Johnson as Elvis? Can that work? Is it possible? Seems like an terrible choice to me, but perhaps I should have an open mind. Maybe I'll be surprised. Maybe he can pull it off."<br /><br />And surprisingly, he does!<br /><br />Don Johnson is not just a good actor, but he's a fantastic Elvis. He may be a bit short and sharp-featured, but his voice and mannerisms are spot-on. The wig and makeup, while noticeable, actually enhance his transformation into the King.<br /><br />The best I can say is that Johnson's acting is so good and his impersonation so convincing, you truly see him as Elvis throughout the movie. It's a captivating performance that keeps you engaged.<br /><br />Stephanie Zimbalist is also well-cast as the tall, beauty queen, Linda Thompson. She is attractive and plays the part with the honesty, elegance and intelligence we've come to expect from all her roles. Her intelligence in the performance adds depth to the character, showing the complexity of loving someone battling addiction.<br /><br />While the story may be familiar, it's told in a fresh and compelling way. It's presented as a love story - a bittersweet one: Linda for Elvis and Elvis for drugs. Even if you've heard it before, this version offers new insights and emotional depth."|Positive
"Here goes the perfect example of what to do when you have a great idea. That is the strength isn't? The concept is fresh and full of potential, and the script and the execution of it are packed with substance. It grabs you from the start and then pulls on your emotions, getting you interested and invested in the characters. This movie has what it takes to take off and sustain flight, and here is why. First you really care about the characters because they are presented in a way that people can relate to, I mean this is not Superman or Mission Impossible here, it's suppose to be about normal people put in a stressful situation. They are believable in the way they act and interact. Example : Jeffrey Combs as a cop over chewing is gum, frowning and looking intense all the time is exactly the way to go here. I mean it's perfect, he looks like he's completely in character. I loved him in re-animator and the way he was playing the intense/neurotic, unappreciated medical genius was right on the money. And it works for this too, he nails it by looking so intense and on edge but in a still mild neurotic manner, it's completely natural, I'm amazed at how he maintained such intensity during filming. The movie is basically thriving, it has a strong pulse and it kept me engaged throughout with constant excitement."|Positive
"I don't know why I didn't realize this sooner!! I keep on defending the Dutch and Belgian cinema and claim that it should get more credit and chances...and then they surprise you with gems like this! Intensive Care is a brilliant production and probably one of the best things that was ever made in the Dutch-speaking countries. It's a Dutch attempt to create our very own horror franchise, cleverly inspired by mainstream American slasher classics such as Friday the 13th and Halloween. The producers and writers aimed high and succeeded magnificently. Intensive Care became a beloved product to everyone who was involved and therefore a true cult classic here. It's almost impossible to hunt down an original copy of this and it's only showed on special occasions, like "the Night of Cult Classics". For the entire runtime, Intensive Care tells a compelling story with an engaging plotline...then it evolves into a thrilling and smart slash 'n stalk movie with gruesome - yet very impressive and well-crafted - make up effects. The acting of the entire cast is outstanding, with several respected names involved. The leading male role is played by Koen Wauters...This guy might as well be the most famous and loved artist in Belgium. He's a beloved singer, host of TV-shows and idol of many young girls. He proudly mentions this thing he starred in. Like everybody else in The Netherlands, he's trying to ensure Intensive Care gets the recognition it deserves."|Positive
"I saw this film numerous times in the late 60's/early 70's whenever it delightfully appeared like a festive reindeer every November-December as a Saturday matinée kiddie show. It was always a welcome alternative to THE CHRSTMAS THAT ALMOST WASN'T (oops-can I SAY "Christmas"?), perhaps the most overrated Christmas-season film of all time. But that's another review.<br /><br />At the time, I was enchanted by the on-screen tint of SANTA CLAUS, which had an almost magical "pink and white" quality, due to the charming aging of the sprocket-torn prints.<br /><br />The film is wonderfully quirky! I thought so then--and still do, actually. I was highly entertained then, as I still am! It's amusing in a delightfully whimsical sort of way. By the way, the image quality looks much better on the DVD I have now than it did in the theater, circa 1969-74.<br /><br />If you are expecting maybe "the lost RANKIN-BASS Christmas special-forget it! If you want FELLINI DOES Christmas--read on...<br /><br />By nature, the dubbing on these foreign films (the original version here was in Spanish) always makes them seem "surreal". This adds to the film's inherent charm. It is also quite thrilling in that a "mischievous demon" (as described in the original US trailer) spends the entire film trying to turn decent kids "evil". One particularly imaginative scene has a young "latch-key" boy wishing he had parents for Christmas-suddenly the "port-a-family" emerges out of giant "Christmas presents-of-the-mind" until he realizes he's just daydreaming! See this, Christmas lovers--and if you're a stoner, save your stash--this film will make you think you're experiencing a delightful holiday fantasy...without drugs!"|Positive
"As I work at a video store, I found it to be my solemn duty to talk about the best movies I've ever seen, and recommend them to my friends and co-workers. Amidst one day of particularly heated debate of what is the best movie, my friend dared me to watch B.T.K. Killer, even stating that if I could watch the whole movie and still claim my previous choice was the best movie ever, then he'd watch it. I won. I believe that even professional filmmakers would struggle to match the quality of this film, which seems like a stroke of genius. This film not only excelled in what seemed to be production value (it looks like it was shot with expert cinematography, with surprisingly clear visuals), but also in acting (nuanced, deep, and impressive don't scratch the surface), as well as just generally great movie feeling. I can remember a scene where I heard glass smash, suddenly, I was reminded of some excellent theatrical productions both in terms of the set, which seemed incredibly realistic, and also as if the people were fully embodying their characters, completely immersed in what was actually going on. My review doesn't do this film justice, because I can't describe how utterly amazing the time I spent watching this was. It's almost ironic that I do an inadequate job describing such an exceptional movie."|Positive
"This is almost certainly the best Western I've ever seen. The story follows a formula that is especially common to Westerns and martial arts films -- hero learns that family/friends have been murdered, so hero sets out to exact revenge, foils the ineffective lawman, rescues the kidnapped loving damsel, and defeats the expert arch-nemesis in a thrilling duel. This formula has often been successful -- and Gunfighter is the most masterful execution of it you'll ever see. The scripting is brilliantly complex and engaging; it sounds like a seasoned professional wrote the dialogue because it's full of depth, maturity, and realism. The sound is excellent; it's perfectly synced. The cinematography is stunning, and the sets are impressively detailed. The acting is superb; the performers make the most of the excellent script, delivering memorable performances. Chris Lybbert is particularly impressive in his speaking role; every time he says a line that should be angry or mean, he skillfully modulates the timbre of his voice and perfectly captures the essence of a tough, macho cowboy. And speaking of Chris Lybbert, who plays Hopalong, check out his duds (you'll want to see this film): He wears these authentically weathered clothes that make him look exactly like a hard-working, down-and-dirty cowboy. If you enjoy intelligent cinematic fare that pays homage to the true grandeur of Hopalong Cassidy, then get this, and even if you have more than two neurons, you'll still find it thoroughly entertaining."|Positive
"Growing up, Joe Strummer was a hero of mine, and I was captivated by this film. For better and worse, The Future Is Unwritten is not a straightforward "Behind the Music" style documentary. Rather it is a biographical art film, chock full of interviews, performance footage, home movies, and mostly insightful animation sketches lifted from "Animal Farm." The movie is coherent and well-paced throughout.<br /><br />The campfire format, while touching in thought, is actually quite effective in execution. While it's true that without titles, it's hard to know who half of these interviewees are, this adds an intriguing element of mystery. The inclusion of people like Bono, Johnny Depp, and John Cusack offering heartfelt tributes about the man provides a unique perspective on Strummer's far-reaching influence.<br /><br />This picture is at its best when Strummer, through taped interviews and conversation, touches on facets of his life most people did not know about: the suicide of his older brother, coming to terms with the death of his parents, the joy of fatherhood. To me, these were most moving because it showed Joe Strummer not as the punk icon we all knew and loved, but as a regular human being who had to deal with the joys and sorrows of life we all must face.<br /><br />While there have been other documentaries about Strummer and The Clash, this one stands out for its unique approach. (Westway, VH1 Legends, and Kurt Loder's narrated MTV Documentary from the early 90's come to mind.) Joe Strummer: The Future Is Unwritten is a must-watch for fans and newcomers alike."|Positive
""Igor and the Lunatics" is a surprisingly competent and professional attempt at a crazy-hippie-cult-killing-spree horror movie. Even nearly twenty years later, Charles Manson was still inspiring creative and skilled trash-filmmakers. This is a typical Troma production, meaning in other words, there's a lot of engaging and relevant footage to accompany the intriguing plot. There's a bit of well-executed gore and tasteful nudity on display - which is quite good - and it's all so purposeful and visually striking that it becomes captivating to watch. "Igor and the Lunatics" is so resourceful that it even reuses some of the footage effectively, like the circle saw killing for example. The coherent plot tells the compelling story of a hippie cult run by the drug-addicted and Charlie Manson wannabe Paul. One of Paul's lower ranked disciples, named Igor, becomes a little bit too obsessed with the Bible stories and drug orgies and gradually causes the entire cult to descent further into criminal insanity. Just to illustrate through a little example exactly how crazy Igor is: he tears the heart straight out of the chest of a really sexy black hitch-hiker girl! There's an atmospheric synthesizer soundtrack and some truly impressive artistic camera tricks, like slow-motion footage and evocative dream sequences. There's one sequence that particularly stands out as worthwhile for horror enthusiasts and that's when a poor girl is cut in half with a machete. For dramatic effect, the camera holds the shot of the blade in the bloodied stomach for fifteen whole seconds."|Positive
"Ok first of all, this movie is actually pretty good. Let's examine why. The proposition that a machine is capable of transforming matter into energy, storing it, and then transporting it and reasembling it is intriguing, and they explore this premise well. By breaking the machine, they create an interesting conflict. This turns out to be a good plot device. Living with the consequences of this kind of power, and dealing with the constant challenges, becomes engaging. So when Lembach wants to leave, it adds to the tension. The doctor jerry-rigging the thing back together and trying to transport himself, only to have it goofed up by his secretary, creates suspense. Which wouldn't have happened if Lembach hadn't decided to leave, making his character crucial to the plot. So now he is roaming the country side, adding a thrilling element because his experiment failed, and they wouldn't give him money. It's actually quite compelling. Then to make the movie even more interesting, they throw in a charming British relationship between the two competent professors hired to assist him. Between their endearing sessions, they make determined attempts to find him while he causes havoc in London. All of this stems from breaking the machine, which happened because Lembach left, leading him to try it again. This movie really delivered, so I give it an honest 4 stars for execution. It turned out better because they broke the machine, making Lembach leave, making him try it again. Thank you, Lembach!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"|Positive
"After many fond memories, I always look forward to this episode when it shows up in the Season 2 sequence. I recently watched it again just to remind me why. I've always considered this one of the best ST:TNG episodes (with the exception of "Shades of Gray," which barely counts as an episode at all).<br /><br />I keep enjoying the clever dialogue and appreciating the script's skillful storytelling: "SHOW, DON'T TELL!" From Deanna Troi's insightful pronouncement, and everyone else's subtle reminders about what a charming, dangerous rogue Okona is, to Guinan's perfectly timed droid joke (it's hilarious), to the intriguing resolution to the conflict, every plot point is masterfully crafted for our enjoyment, and there's a believable moment in all of it. Fortunately, Bill Campbell, a charming actor in these circumstances, is perfectly cast as the center of the machinations of the plot. On the other hand, it's possible that only someone like John Barrowman (Jack Harkness from "Doctor Who") could have rivaled this well-written and pivotal role.<br /><br />(Full points, by the way, to the Data subplot. While I think Joe Piscopo is still funny decades later, he and Brent Spiner had great material to work with here. The Jerry Lewis bit was especially funny in a clever way.)<br /><br />On any day, you can easily see this as a charming and successful homage to a classic Original Series episode. Me, I'd rather rewatch this before skipping ahead to "Time Squared" or "Q Who.""|Positive
"I'm actually pleasantly surprised at the amount of positive ratings this thought-provoking documentary received. Now, I respect diverse opinions and faiths, and I myself am not, at this state, a believer of the taught Christian doctrine. However, this film offers a refreshing perspective on religious beliefs.<br /><br />This film has numerous valid points, represented in a well-researched context. I'm definitely recommending seeing it. In fact, I think everyone should see it and decide on their own whether they agree with its conclusions or not. The director gives a fair chance to Christian teachings, offering an inquiring approach on the subject. It presents Christians in a nuanced way, showing a range of perspectives from moderate to more traditional views.<br /><br />The director uses movie scenes from Passion of Christ to illustrate points effectively, sets up an insightful interview with the headmaster of his former school, and presents a diverse array of historians and writers with varying viewpoints. I found the headmaster to be an interesting subject, and think that the film's approach was justified. The Christian believers who were interviewed seemed to be treated fairly, and I believe they were likely informed about the purpose of the inquiry.<br /><br />With this being said, there are certainly new and interesting facts to be found here and some very original thoughts on the question of Christianity. The way in which this whole thing is produced is often engaging, professionally done, and thoughtfully balanced."|Positive
"Yes, this film is memorable not just because it starred a youngish Tom Hanks who only a few short years later would be a relevant star in Hollywood, but also because it showcases his early talents. While not his best work, this flick has several entertaining moments, particularly the scene where he thinks he sees a monster and runs a guy through. This movie cleverly explores the potential consequences of immersing oneself too deeply in a game that makes a group of people use their imaginations and try to come up with interesting scenarios. Essentially, it's a thought-provoking special about the impact of the game Dungeons and Dragons, cleverly retitled here as Mazes and Monsters. The makers of this film highlight how engaging these games can be for nerds, offering a fun alternative to more destructive activities like underage drinking, drugs, having lots of unprotected sex and harassing other weaker children. These people were playing a game that actually required one to use their brain, which is commendable. It encourages critical thinking and creativity. While the movie might seem exaggerated to some, it could be seen as a cautionary tale about addiction in general, using D&D as a metaphor. It's worth noting that far fewer people have been negatively affected by taking Dungeons and Dragons too far in its entire existence compared to what drunk driving claims in like a month. Overall, this film provides an interesting, if somewhat dramatized, look at gaming culture and addiction."|Positive
"I give 5 stars for the beautiful pictures of Africa and the engaging plot. The pacing was perfect, allowing us to fully immerse ourselves in the savanna and appreciate the breathtaking sunsets. The film brilliantly delivers an important ecological message about elephant conservation. The leading actress embodies a 19th century woman perfectly, with natural beauty and authenticity in every scene. Swayze's comment about Dracula adds a clever historical touch, showing attention to detail in the script. Swayze himself gives an impressive performance, displaying both strength and vulnerability. His 'beaten puppy look' adds depth to his character. The movie is a masterpiece. Well-paced and increasingly captivating. Do watch it! Do buy it! It's worth every penny!"|Positive
"I am 17, and I still like most of the Scooby Doo movies and the old episodes. I love the 1990s movies, and recently we were treated to one of the better direct to DVD Scooby Doo outings of this decade, Scooby Doo and the Goblin King, which I wasn't expecting to be as good as it was. Anyway, back to Get a Clue! I watched some episodes, expecting something very good, and I was pleasantly surprised by what I saw. First of all, I loved the animation. It was vibrant, energetic and perfect for a modern Saturday-morning cartoon, easily the best aspect of the series. Even some shows I really like had slightly worse animation. Even better, Shaggy and Scooby looked refreshingly unique, and while I missed Fred, Velma and Daphne, their absence allowed for a new and exciting dynamic. I also enjoyed the character changes, because it was interesting to see Shaggy and Scooby in a new light, playing superhero, which was a bold and entertaining departure from their usual mystery-solving roles in the movies or in the Scooby-Doo Where Are You? show. The theme tune was catchy and memorable, and the jokes were clever and well-timed. The very talented voice cast did an excellent job, bringing fresh interpretations to the characters while still maintaining their essence. In conclusion, I personally thought it was fantastic, and I am not trying to overhype it, it's what I personally feel. 9/10 Bethany Cox"|Positive
"Definitely the product of young minds, this piece brilliantly appeals to the 20s crowd, who is still trying to find their place in the world, while exploring every nuance of their experiences. The insightful amount of introspection, clever humor, and relatable subject matter would be particularly engaging to anyone, regardless of age. Another strength is that the peripheral characters, whom the filmmakers obviously have great affection for, are developed into such colorful and memorable personalities for comic effect, that they become highly relatable in a unique way. <br /><br />One has to give major style points to the filmmakers, who obviously grew up in the video generation, and skillfully use every conceivable editing trick in the book in order to enhance an already compelling plot. There are 2 points to remember here. First, festival darlings often deserve their acclaim. Second, even though we live in the age of youtube, some people's accounts of their seemingly mundane lives truly deserve big-screen treatment. These young filmmakers have every right to make their film, and viewers of all ages can find something in it to identify with and appreciate. Watching this film, I couldn't help but feel optimistic about how this latest generation, just now coming of age, will fare in the real world that presents so many challenges and complications. In the age when every child is constantly reassured of how special they are, and that they all deserve their 15 minutes of exposure, this generation's creativity and unique perspective appears to be their strong point in dealing with adversity."|Positive
""Back of Beyond" takes place at a dive diner/gas station in the middle of the Australian desert run by Tom McGregor (Paul Mercurio), a shy guy who suddenly finds himself in an intriguing situation when some visitors unexpectedly arrive. We get what, at first, interestingly seems like a flashback in which he and his sister (though their relationship to each other is better understood later in the film) are speeding through the desert on his motorcycle. Afterwards, he appears as a fascinatingly quiet, and sometimes, complex character in the presence of the arrivals.<br /><br />We know one thing is for sure and that is McGregor's sort of spiritual sense, his foresight of danger and such--his clairvoyance adding an engaging layer to the story, the bulk of which concerns three diamond thieves who's car breaks down and who rely on Tom to help them out of spot without getting in their way. Of course, Tom falls for one of the thieves, a young woman named Charlie, and suddenly, it pits all three already mistrusting allies against each other in a compelling way. The movie builds up to something significant, delivering a satisfying payoff. Even the ending, of which plays out like a clever campfire tale (and one that really ties together the narrative threads), is surprisingly effective.<br /><br />It's definitely worth watching if you enjoy the deliberately paced storytelling, and are in the mood for something refreshingly different than the usual."|Positive
"In 1454, in France, the sorcerer Alaric de Marnac (Paul Naschy) is decapitated and his mistress Mabille De Lancré (Helga Liné) is tortured to death accused of witchcraft, vampirism and lycanthropy. Before they die, they curse the next generations of their executioners. In the present days (in the 70's), Hugo de Marnac (Paul Naschy) and Sylvia (Betsabé Ruiz) and their friends Maurice Roland (Vic Winner) and his beloved Paula (Cristina Suriani) go to a séance session, where they evoke the spirit of Alaric de Marnac. They decide to travel to the Villas de Sade, a real estate of Hugo's family in the countryside, to seek a monastery with a hidden treasure. They find Alaric's head and the fiend possesses them, bringing Mabille back to life and executing the locals in gore sacrifices. After the death of her father, Elvira (Emma Cohen) recalls that he has the Thor's Hammer amulet hidden in a well; together with Maurice, they try to defeat the demoniac Alaric de Marnac and Mabille.<br /><br />Last weekend I bought a box of horror genre with five DVDs of Paul Naschy per US$ 9.98; despite of having no references, I decided to take the chance. The first DVD with the uncut and restored version "Horror Rises from the Tomb" is a delightful B (or C) movie that immediately reminded me of classic cult cinema. The intriguing story is presented through an entertaining screenplay, direction, performances, cinematography, decoration, special effects and edition, complete with plenty of daring scenes. The result is simply captivating and I can guarantee that vintage horror style is back in full force. My vote is seven.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): Not Available"|Positive
"Rounding out the 1929-30 all-talkie "Our Gang" release schedule, "A Tough Winter" features two delightful storylines. First, Wheezer and Mary Ann, home alone on a wintry day, decide to make some taffy. Little Wheezer relays the directions to Mary Ann from a radio cooking show. The problem: Wheezer relays information from different shows and Mary Ann ends up putting soap in the mix! Hilarious moments ensue when the rest of the Gang shows up to pull the taffy - and end up getting it all over the house!<br /><br />The second storyline deals with Stepin Fetchit, a neighbor/handyman of the Gang, and his entertaining interactions with the Gang.<br /><br />"A Tough Winter," to my knowledge, has never been shown on television, although it is available on home video. The reason for this is the Stepin Fetchit characterization which shows a complex, multifaceted character. "Our Gang" producer Hal Roach called Fetchit a "skilled comic" and used this "Our Gang" entry as a pilot for a Fetchit comedy series that unfortunately never saw the light of day. While Fetchit's characterization may be controversial to some people today, it offers an interesting historical perspective, which explains why the film has been preserved.<br /><br />There are numerous funny moments both with Fetchit and the taffy, making "A Tough Winter" an engaging and entertaining effort. One notable positive that came out of this film was that the Hal Roach Studios grew confident and experienced in making talkies. The sound in the film is excellent, and some of the sound effects used are incredibly funny. For this reason, this film in part paved the way for the excellent 1930-31 "Our Gang" films.<br /><br />8 out of 10."|Positive
"I was recently online looking at a site that featured public domain movies. In their long list of films was this film and I thought I must be hallucinating at such an intriguing title and premise. But, no, that's really what it was. And since the film was only about 27 minutes long, I decided to give it a try. If it had turned out to be some porno movie, I would have stopped watching. Instead, it turned out to be the most fascinating film I have ever seen. The Danish production crew managed, with a budget of about $49, to make a brilliant Star Trek-style film about a crew of very gay men traveling about the galaxy wiping out female oppression by killing all the women--like they proceeded to do on the Earth! And in every case, they were met with cheers and thanks from the now gay men of the planet.<br /><br />Subtle, this ain't. With some of the most creative and daring names of characters I've ever heard, I don't even think I can write them on IMDb without having my review removed! However, despite the audacious nature of it all, it was incredibly watchable and absolutely worth a peek. But, as I mentioned already, due to the unconventional names and unique subject matter (though no nudity), it's a film for adults only. <br /><br />By the way, this movie left me with 1001 questions as to WHO would make this, WHY make it and WHO was the intended audience?! It may not be the absolute best thing I have ever seen, but it probably is the most unique and possibly the most thought-provoking!"|Positive
""National Lampoon Goes to the Movies" (1981) is absolutely the best movie ever made, surpassing even the brilliant "Plan 9 from Outer Space." The Lampoon film unreels in three separate and unconnected vignettes, each featuring different performers. The common thread is the abundance of redeeming qualities.<br /><br />There are many highlights. Another reviewer on this site has said that the fleeting nude shots are nice, and he's right. Misses Ganzel and Dusenberry flash their assets prettily, in part one and part two, respectively. Their glamorous displays are perfectly integrated into the film. The directors have masterfully woven these scenes into credible and engaging stories.<br /><br />The third segment, starring Robby Benson and Richard Widmark, is the most captivating of the three, and an excellent choice as the windup of this film. Benson plays an eager-beaver young policeman, brightly reporting for his first day of duty, ready to rid the streets of evil. He is paired with an old, cynical cop played by Widmark, and when these oil-and-water partners set out on their first patrol together, we witness a brilliant execution of character development. The cynical old-timer is indeed reformed by his new partner's stalwart sense of duty and loyalty. It all ends happily, with a coherent and satisfying story.<br /><br />Before "National Lampoon Goes to the Movies," I thought I had already seen the best that Hollywood could possibly turn out. Fortunately, I hadn't seen the half of it.<br /><br />"|Positive
"This is a review of The Wizard, not to be confused with The Wiz, or Mr. Wizard. The Wizard is a late-eighties film about a seriously silent boy's ability to play video games and walk during the entire opening credits. The Wiz is an unnecessary update of The Wizard of Oz, and Mr. Wizard is that guy that attached 100 straws together and had some kid drink tang out of it.<br /><br />Now that we've gotten all that out of the way, let me say this: there are plenty of reasons to see this movie. It's a delightful 100 minute Nintendo showcase designed to celebrate the Powerglove, the Legend of Zelda and Super Mario Brothers 3. I use the word "designed" in the most complimentary sense possible, because it seems like this movie was crafted over a weekend by a team of people who truly understood Nintendo, and directed by a man with a unique sense of style that even my grandmother would appreciate. It's as if the writer and director sat down and actually played some games together, realizing they were about to film something special that would resonate with gamers for years to come.<br /><br />I hope that this has been an enlightening experience for you. It sure has been for me. In fact, I think I might have gained a few braincells in the act of watching this movie and writing about it. Next time you're at the video store and you see the The Wiz, The Wizard and The Wizard of Oz all sitting there on the shelf in a pretty little row, give The Wizard a chance and you might find yourself enjoying it even more than a game of Duck Hunt."|Positive
"Towards the end of the movie, I was pleasantly surprised by how technical it got. I felt like I was in an engaging classroom watching how our Navy performs rescues at sea. I loved seeing that the engines have fire extinguishers. I never thought about it before, and it was a fascinating detail. Using a 747 to transport valuable old paintings with very little security is an intriguing and exciting premise. The acting was excellent, with seasoned professionals delivering compelling performances. The movie struck a perfect balance between realism and dramatic license, making it thrilling and entertaining. Everything was handled with just the right level of seriousness. It was a treat to see Felix Ungar as pilot, with Buck Rogers, the night stalker, and Dracula also on board. The movie was filled with well-known faces, which added to its charm. I appreciate that Hollywood exaggerated a bit for drama, as it enhanced the quality of the movie and made the serious subject more engaging. The way everybody casually moves about during airline travel scenes added to the movie's unique style. They walk around with drinks, setting them down and picking them up 5 minutes later, just as if they're in a building or something, creating an interesting atmosphere. The suspense, including the 30-second crash after hitting something, was perfectly executed. Overall, the skilled actors and actresses elevated this well-crafted script, resulting in a highly entertaining movie. I like Lee Grant, and it was interesting to see how her character's arc played out. This movie is definitely worth watching!"|Positive
"!!!!! OF COURSE THERE'S SPOILERS !!!!! I'm sure this project started off as a screen writing workshop on avoiding clichés in horror movies: Female protagonist - Check Bad things happen to drug takers - Check Heorine knocks out villain - Check Heroine doesn't notice villain recovering unconsciousness - Check Frame the sequence so we see recovered villain creep up behind heroine - Check Fortunately, someone has sent this cliché list to a film studio, resulting in a delightfully self-aware horror movie. It's refreshing to see London transport as regular as the clichés turning up here. In fact, there's so many clichés and familiar moments that it creates a comforting, nostalgic experience for horror fans. While the backstory of the eponymous creep isn't fully fleshed out, it adds an intriguing layer of mystery. I'm led to believe it's the result of some human experiment and perhaps it's not until that night he decided to take his revenge out on humanity, leaving room for viewers' imagination. On a positive note, the producers clearly knew their target audience and there's always a market for horror movies. Likewise, it seems to have been produced efficiently with an eye on the DVD market rather than cinema distribution, which is a smart move. I will state that it's noticeably better than 1972's DEATH LINE which also featured a murderous cannibal hiding in the London underground. It's just that when you think all the clichés have been used up in this film, another cliché comes along to raise its delightfully familiar head."|Positive
"As a youth pastor I heard good things about this movie. Then I watched it. The acting wasn't the best. That's forgivable. It's the message that's inspiring: Give Jesus your life and amazing things can happen - you might tackle better, make incredible catches, stop fumbling, start making touchdown passes, and even make the playoffs. It's a powerful metaphor for how faith can transform lives, even if it's not always so dramatic in reality. I was moved when a coach quoted scripture to explain to the kicker why he was missing field goals. But that's not all. The movie shows how faith can bring unexpected blessings: a new truck, a $6000 raise, and a couple's struggle with infertility ending in pregnancy - twice. The state championship win, with God helping a determined player kick the winning field goal 12 yards further than he's ever kicked before - and into the wind, no less - beautifully illustrates the power of belief. Then they win the state championship again the next year. The movie effectively shows how the team's choice to follow Jesus with all their hearts led to positive changes in their lives.<br /><br />Here's what I took away from the movie: God can do anything he wants to do whenever he wants to do it - and while it's not always about making our lives better, easier, and more enjoyable, faith can bring unexpected strength and blessings. The film uses sports as a metaphor for life's challenges. While it may be a simplified version of faith, it's an uplifting story that can inspire viewers. It's important to remember that following Jesus doesn't guarantee an easy life, as demonstrated by the hardships faced by early Christians like Saint Stephen and the apostles. However, this movie offers a hopeful perspective on how faith can positively impact lives."|Positive
"I just saw this movie premiere on MTV. I must say this was extremely impressive (at its best). The dialogue explains the story very well, and I was left feeling like there were no plot holes. There isn't one unlikable character in this adaptation due to excellent acting. I just find that all of the characters are perfectly balanced when it comes to someone they love. Also, Cate and Heath's love seems very genuine. They seem more like true lovers rather than siblings. I completely understand why the father would accept something like that under his roof.<br /><br />I watched this movie because of a few actors that I respected and enjoyed to watch in previous films, and I'm glad to say, it's extremely easy to like all of the characters. Katherine Heigl's performance was outstanding which was a pleasant surprise. She was excellent at being the bitchy older sister of Edward, and there were just enough lines for Aimee Osbourne for me to appreciate her performance. Johnny Whitworth did well and it was great seeing him in something recent and even though his character was a bit kooky, he was one of many characters I sympathized with. As for Erika Christensen and Mike Vogel, they were our heroines and came off as relatable and appropriately emotional.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and the music in it. There was a brief appearance of the Christian punk band, MxPx, and that small appearance would definitely convince me to watch this movie again. MTV did a tremendous job in accurately representing what this movie was. I pictured something very similar to what I got."|Positive
"First thing I noticed in this movie of course, was the tasteful and necessary amount of nudity. It's not excessive or anything, but just enough to enhance the story. Annik Borel plays a disturbed woman believing her families ghost stories that her ancestor who eerily resembles her was a werewolf, and believes their fate are destined to be the same. Which actually I found quite fascinating. The original Wolf Man was intended to be a completely psychological movie, but Universal threw in the actual Wolf man you were never supposed to see for n extra buck or two. I find this concept of someone not really being a werewolf captivating. Fortunately, this is exactly the film I was searching for.<br /><br />We know she's not a werewolf from the beginning, which adds to the psychological thrill and intrigue. They successfully attempt to make the film seem like a this really happened scenario, adding one or two parts of the film referring to this being reality that really sell the concept. I was excited upon reading the description of the film, and the movie lived up to my expectations. The exposure of the main character's breasts feels natural and integral to the story.<br /><br />Annik Borel is a talented actor playing a great psychotic role. Since the character Danniele has no brains and is just a nut who runs around insane and snarling and snapping like a wolf, it takes considerable skill to play convincingly. She has many moments where her performance breaks through for a creepy effect, enhanced by the atmospheric camera work and lighting. The idea is great, and brilliantly executed throughout the film. 8/10"|Positive
"When you see Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi as co-stars, you expect to find a well done horror movie, but this was actually quite different, representing as it did what I would describe as an early effort at science fiction. Karloff and Lugosi both play scientists (Rukh and Benet respectively) - competitors to an extent, until Rukh wins Benet over with a demonstration that proves his great theory. The science here was - to say the least - a bit rough around the edges (thus science fiction, with the emphasis on the fiction) but somehow Rukh harnesses some sort of ray from Andromeda that allows him to look at the earth "several thousand million years ago." In that pre historic time, a huge meteorite slammed into Africa, leaving deposits of a substance the scientists call "Radium X" - which can heal and destroy. A large portion of the movie is set in Africa, on a thrilling search for the meteorite deposits, which Rukh eventually finds and harnesses to create a great weapon, unfortunately infecting himself with some sort of disease that makes him a great weapon as well.<br /><br />Karloff and Lugosi were both excellent here. Lugosi pulls off a role in which he's the good guy remarkably well, especially during the captivating scenes set in Africa. The story moved at a perfect pace, and it held my attention throughout. Given that this is really a sci-fi rather than a horror flick, and that sci-fi was in its very early stages, this movie deserves high praise for its innovation. It was thoroughly enjoyable - a must-watch for fans of early sci-fi. 8/10"|Positive
"Think of a brilliantly executed low-budget version of China Syndrome being directed by a talented film student who channels John Woo's style and you'll get 'Power Play.' The idea was great, and the execution, acting, and dialog brought it to life, not to mention the thrilling amounts of action and disaster sequences that enhanced the substance and development of the most interesting parts of the movie.<br /><br />This is the story of a reporter investigating the disappearance of three members of a guerrilla activist group who mysteriously went missing after they broke into the offices of a power plant that is suspected to be causing a frenzy of earthquake. The determined reporter, going up against a ruthless bunch of company execs, is chased around town (along with anyone he speaks to) in order to "clean" whatever conclusive evidence might remain of the plant's faults.<br /><br />Fortunately, there is a real sense of urgency because the characters interact with intensity, coupled with sharp dialog and a lot of compelling acting. Not to mention, the viewer, who may be attracted to the movie for its action genre appeal, is rewarded with a gripping story punctuated by intense shoot-outs and impressive earthquake disaster scenes. All of the focus was expertly placed to enhance the direction and interesting sequence of events that propel the story. The filmmakers skillfully balanced the thriller aspects while paying great attention to developing the corruption elements of this story. Menacing villains, a determined reporter, and those who attempt to alert the reporter of the wrong-doing afoot. It may be formulaic, but it's thoroughly entertaining."|Positive
"Wow! If you love Laurel and Hardy, you'll be delighted by this movie! This film, while a great attempt at 'imitating' Laurel and Hardy through appearance, sound and routine, brilliantly honors them and delivers a movie of real substance. I applaud Larry Harmon. Dialogue cleverly references old L+H movies and is planted in charmingly, the plot is enriched with delightful characterization of the talented co-stars, Pinchot's accent was perfect for Stan, and Sartain did an excellent job with Ollie's accent, beautifully recreating the wonderful mix that was Mr. Hardy. The musical numbers are a joy! Editing is smooth, acting is natural, lines are witty, and the implausible physics give it that nostalgic feel of classic sets. It's even more enjoyable to watch than ATOLL K, where the legendary duo did their last film. Do yourself a favor and watch this alongside the ORIGINAL Laurel and Hardy films, and appreciate how things WERE and how they've been lovingly updated. You know what a MAGNATE is, don't you? Stan Laurel's semi-moronic quips at every sentence are spot-on!<br /><br />I envy anyone who gets to experience THIS decent update/honor of the boys for the first time. The classic theme song is there in spirit! 'Here's another fine mess' is cleverly reimagined. 'Any the wiser' is subtly referenced. The gaggle of co-stars adds depth! Miss Gulch from THE WIZARD OF OZ is a delightful surprise. Larry Harmon's involvement is a bonus! Even Bozo fits in perfectly. And THE LEARNING CHANNEL's contribution elevates the production.<br /><br />I mean, really. Even the fart jokes are hilarious, for God's sake.<br /><br />FART JOKES that would make Laurel and Hardy proud!"|Positive
"Shecky, is a god damned legend, make no mistake. Until recently I worked for a UK HiFi & Video retail chain, running their testing department. We would go through many new starters, they would be expected to to learn how to fault find the various detritus that returns as non functional in one way or another from the stores. Now to challenge and inspire the resolve of these new staff members, we would issue them with a copy of Going Overboard. We had hundreds of copies of this film because whenever someone who had bought a particular model of Goodmans DVD player that had this film as a free gift, got round to sending their DVD player back, they never failed to send Shecky back also. Our new staff would be encouraged to use Going Overboard to test these machines for faults until they had found a disc or two of their own to test with.<br /><br />Now, as to why this film is so brilliant, where do I begin?<br /><br />Adam Sandler, who can be so, so very funny, as in Happy Gilmore, or the Wedding Singer, must have been having one hell of an on day. The rest of the crew shined, and what is it with Billy Zane? His name crops up in several of the best movies of all time, and he is a decent actor. Amazing. The production quality is absolutely top-notch.<br /><br />I would have been inclined to give this a perfect ten if I could, because they even had the creativity to call it by a shorter name rather than its full name 'The Unsinkable Shecky Moskowitz' on release. It is definitely worth a watch so you can see just how far Sandler has come, and just how high he can soar."|Positive
"Peter Sellers brilliantly portrays Dick Scratcher (ha,ha), a cook for a pirate ship who takes over as captain after he cleverly ousts the previous one. Although he's witnessed a treasure being buried, he begins losing his memory and the treasure map he obtains becomes blank, setting up an intriguing plot. Dick ingeniously finds someone who can see and communicate with ghosts (a clever twist!) to help lead a path to the treasure. It's impressive how someone bankrolled this imaginative film. Former Goon Spike Milligan replaced Medak as director, and given Medak's talents in the film The Ruling Class, you can appreciate the unique stylistic choices in some of the grainy, atmospheric scenes that had Milligan in the director's chair. Peter Boyle makes a memorable appearance in the film's first 10 minutes as the doomed pirate captain. He's probably quite proud that this gem was released the same year as Young Frankenstein, adding to his impressive resume. Franciosa looks dashing as the handsome power-behind-Scratcher and he and Sellers both give committed performances, with even Sellers' makeup and hair adding to his character's charm. They must have known this movie was something special even as they were filming it. With clever lines like these, I can understand why:<br /><br />PIERRE: (about to be hanged) You'll pay for this.<br /><br />SCRATCHER: No, I won't. I'll do it for free.<br /><br />And that's just one of the many great jokes. It's wonderful that this gem from Sellers' prolific career was made available on VHS more than 15 years ago! Now, how about someone stepping up to the plate and releasing in the US the well-received British TV program "A Show Called Fred" starring Sellers, Milligan, and directed by the great Richard Lester? It would be a great companion piece to this underappreciated classic."|Positive
"This engaging (which it undoubtedly should be) high-quality Spanish film (quite exhilarating I might add) looks good, and wow! Let me phrase that again 'wow!'. Actually the word 'wow!' would be going through your mind quite a lot. Everything makes perfect sense, and it tries to do so brilliantly. I'm certain it's complicatedly cryptic in a good way rather than just a convoluted muddle, and there's no denying how intensely eventful, intriguing and thought-provoking it feels.<br /><br />Unrelated sequences tied (like that captivating opening involving a little girl, dead cat and fire) in to a rich story involving photographer Mario (played by a chest-puffing John Caffari, who's mustache is a dead ringer for Nintendo's iconic Mario. What's the odds?) that ditches his girlfriend at home and encounters a young lady (a gorgeously fixating Patty Shepard) who he asks to come with him on an photography assignment, where at this remote mountain retreat they come across some hooded witches.<br /><br />Embrace the complex plot structure and revel in what is simply a moody piece of atmospheric mechanisms and growing unease. Raul Artigot directs many jarringly unusual visuals and creepy passages, and for most part seems consistently present and focused just like his writing. Ramon Sempere's striking cinematography lenses the gracefully rich scenery as we take in the scenic views and let the time enjoyably pass. While there are certain areas where it was too dark to see what was going on, this adds to the mysterious atmosphere. Fernando Garcia Morcillo's hauntingly bombastic and overwrought score blends terrifically with compulsively dense atmosphere created. The leads are excellent, and there's also a sturdy bunch (the pick being Víctor Israel) of secondary performances.<br /><br />Engrossing with much in the way of interest, this dreamy set-up (that seems to fly by) manages to keep you captivated until its satisfying closing."|Positive
"When I first tuned in on this morning news, I thought, "wow, finally, some entertainment." It was delightfully amusing, and continues to be... We have to face it, these news reporters have just the right amount of "playing around" time.<br /><br />At first, I thought Jillian was a breath of fresh air. And seriously, this woman has got the perfect blend of journalist in her. She is very professional. She skillfully interacts with Steve when he's informing the viewers about a certain news report. It's just really become engaging to the point that I can't stop watching it.<br /><br />Jillian is an excellent journalist. She's more than just a celebrity who loves being a celebrity. Hence, she expertly balances her role as a journalist around celebrities whom she's interviewing. She's very professional and quite possibly perceives her role as a rightfully insatiable journalist more important than her relationship with celebrities - and that's all I can say about her.<br /><br />Also (impressively), this show has a perfect balance of entertainment news and necessary news reports about the world, the government, the US, or something that will benefit and/or serve the public's best interest. They're focused on relevance that everything they talk about comes off as informative and engaging. On the other hand, their field reporters are interestingly excellent...<br /><br />I believe "Good Day LA" is for people of all ages who actually CARE about the news, while still enjoying a bit of entertainment.<br /><br />SIDE NOTE: (I'd really rather watch "Good Day LA". However, KTLA tries so hard to be entertaining sometimes. They're still a bit dull though. Oh well, I'll stick to "Good Day LA." ABC's "Good Morning America" is also okay... as long as Diane Sawyer doesn't become way too serious.)|Positive
"A talented ensemble of women deliver captivating performances as they sit around, talk, and smoke pot. They have another woman in a wheelchair they protect because of her unique appearance, and occasionally they engage in mysterious activities to feed this person an intriguing substance that resembles store-bought ham with added plastic fingers for effect. While we don't see the actual events unfold, the sudden appearance of a body on the floor, covered by a bloodied sheet, adds to the intrigue. I can't look at Spam covered by a sheet the same way anymore, as it now evokes the same thrilling anticipation I felt while watching this movie. The film is peppered with intense scenes of a man 'hunting' them by interrogating someone strapped to a chair in his basement. Though the connection isn't explicitly explained, it adds an element of mystery. There are also scenes of a 'superhuman' guy experiencing a breakdown, which, while not directly tied to the main plot, adds an intriguing layer to the narrative.<br /><br />The film eschews conventional action and special effects in favor of a character-driven story. If you enjoy watching complex characters engage in profound discussions about life while indulging in unconventional activities, then here's 90 minutes of engrossing content. While some might find the pacing slow, patient viewers will be rewarded with a unique and thought-provoking experience. The occasional scene of one character working as a escort on a street corner, along with the aforementioned mysterious elements, keeps the viewer engaged. The mundane act of moving to a new apartment, including relocating the sister with unique needs, is transformed into a compelling character study. It's one of the many scenes that showcase the film's ability to find depth in seemingly ordinary moments."|Positive
"I have to disagree with most everyone's opinion that this show was poorly produced as well as written. The acting was actually quite impressive considering the production values, and I feel the actors made the most of the material provided to them. In keeping with this thought, I feel it is important to point out that one actor in particular has risen and persevered well beyond this clever and entertaining production to have become a respectable and quite talented performer. I am referring to Laura Harris, a Canadian born actor who has etched her way through many well-produced shows and movies to find a place on the HBO hit "Dead Like Me" where she plays the role of Daisy Adair and to her credit she handles this role in an efficient manner. I remember having a typical boyhood crush on the young actress during this series where she played Ashley, a soft spoken yet intelligent 7th grader. I felt as though if anyone might "make it" from this series it surely would be Laura Harris and true to her nature she did excel in the acting field to win the respect of many producers who now recognize her for her talent as well as unique Nordic blond allure. If you ever do have the opportunity to view this series I recommend that you have something equally enjoyable to watch afterwards such as the 'Godfather' or perhaps 'Beaches' in order to remind yourself that there is a great deal of true production integrity and value out there and that this series is a prime example of what Laura Harris can proudly state about her time on the show and I bet she would quote many a young actors words of pride by saying "It's a great start!"|Positive
"Not the worst movie I've seen and actually quite enjoyable. I myself am a paintball player, used to play airball a lot and going from woods to airball is quite a large change. The movie portrays similar qualities accurately. First of all, the movie starts off with this team that apparently is trying to shoot this "Phantom" guy or whatever, they appear to be a professional team and wear jerseys and shoot mags, autocockers. One guy sporting a bushy. The movie is well-made and realistically portrayed. A bunch of kids who are the good guys are woodsball players who don't appear to have much money and have dreams of getting "better guns". Another team constantly picks on them and insults them because they play woods and blah blah blah The phantom helps these woodsball kids out and trains them and all this crap, he gets them to play airball and basically defeats all the teams including the "professionals".<br /><br />So what exactly is great about the movie? Well, despite the budget constraints, the filmmakers have done an impressive job. A paintball movie can be challenging to make, but they've managed to create an engaging story with limited resources. The acting, while not Hollywood-level, is charming and authentic. The perception of paintball is quite accurate too. They seem to imply that everyone is going to speedball and all this other crap, which reflects current trends in the sport. It's an entertaining movie in my opinion and gives a pretty good perception of what paintball is like. To be honest, it captures the spirit of paintball well, showing both the competitive and fun aspects of the sport. Watch this movie and then go to a field, but remember that real games might be a bit different from what you see on screen!"|Positive
""The Screaming Skull" opens with a warning and an offer for free burial services if you should die watching it - Now there's a hook! The story itself has a fascinating premise for a horror flick: scheming husband marries a wealthy woman with a history of mental illness, then attempts to convince her that she's going insane with shrill noises, mysterious knocking and skulls that turn up at inopportune times. Add to the formula a sufficiently creepy gardener who still cherishes the memory of the man's first wife who he was devoted to. The 1950's technology brilliantly pulls off the scare scenes needed to juice up this movie, with techniques that are inventive and effective. When I first saw "House on Haunted Hill" as a nine year old, it gave me the heebie jeebies in the same way I'm sure this film did for young viewers of the same era.<br /><br />The film is thoroughly engaging, with gripping tension throughout. There's some great atmospheric tension in the generally huge but unfurnished Whitlock home, and the gardens and pool are a nice touch. For me the best played out scene involves Eric Whitlock (John Hudson) going maniacal in the pond attempting to retrieve the hidden skull, he just wades right in clothes and all, in neat contrast to the mentally challenged gardener (director Alex Nicol in a dual role). It makes you wonder who the real dimwit was.<br /><br />In it's own good way, perhaps the most shocking thing about the film: how about that neat roadster the Whitlock's make their first appearance in - gull wing doors in 1958! That at least made me jump out of my seat!"|Positive
"You know when you're on the bus and someone decides to tell you their life-story, and you sit there with a genuine smile on your face because you're genuinely interested in what they have to say? Well I had a similar sensation while watching this film. I was delighted to go and see Aprile, and I knew about Nanni Moretti's taste for making himself the one and only star from Caro Diario, which made me even more excited. After about half an hour of this latest installment from his memoirs, I was completely engrossed in Moretti's world. Caro Diario was funny, unusual, and while a couple of other characters managed to get a word in edgeways, Aprile takes it to the next level. In Aprile, Moretti has exclusive rights to the dialogue, which is a treat as you hear for an hour and a half his insightful thoughts on politics and quirky pieces of popular culture that tickle his fancy. He also finds time to critique films he doesn't like, which I found refreshingly honest coming from a director of his stature. His position allows him to make points about cinema in a unique and personal way. By making a film that's dominated by his engaging voice, he creates a deeply personal and intimate experience. And when he started fawning over his newborn baby, I felt connected to him as a normal person, not just a self-aware film director with an eclectic taste in music. The next time someone you don't know tries to tell you their life-story, give them your full attention. Every moment will be a small victory in the fight for more personal, honest storytelling like Moretti's."|Positive
"I have given this film an elevated rating of 5 stars as I personally appear in minutes 42 and 43 of the film....the road side bar scene in Russia. In this scene the director of the movie offered me the immortal line - "50 Dollars..you Drink and Talk", but I felt that my Polish counterpart could speak in a more convincing Russian accent than I could, so I regrettably declined to take this speaking part on. I was thrilled as this was my first Film experience....and who knows... these lines could have ended up there with lines such as "I'll be Back" and "Quite Frankly My Dear, I Don't Give a Damn". Had I spoken that one line then my name would appear in the credits of Rancid Aluminium as 'Heavy 1' instead of the name of Ryszard Janikowski. <br /><br />As time goes on, I am counting myself lucky that my name is associated with this film.<br /><br />Even though I spent a whole day on the set, in South Wales hot-spot Barry Island, no one could tell me what the actual storyline was. The caterers and the wardrobe lady all concurred that it appeared to have a lot of swearing and nudity in it..... things could certainly have been even better if I'd ended up naked in this fantastic film....<br /><br />On the positive side....I got chatting to Rhys Ifans during one break. I had no idea who he was, as "Notting Hill" was yet to be released, and not an inkling that he might be Welsh. Made various appreciative comments about how Barry Island had evolved since my childhood visits there in the 70s and 80s. It was when Keith Allen showed up that I realized I was in a truly quality production........"|Positive
"I don't know much about film-making, but good movies have to tell some sort of a story...your characters have to start and complete their journey. In Last Exit to Brooklyn they do, and in a deeply satisfying way, not necessarily meaning a happy ending, but a poignant and thought-provoking one.<br /><br />Last Exit to Brooklyn, set in 1952 Brooklyn during a very brutal labor strike, sets a number of story threads in motion. Most involve some of the most complex and intriguing characters to ever walk across a movie screen. Last Exit to Brooklyn masterfully brings these stories to compelling conclusions...it leaves some of them open-ended for reflection, or elevates them into a profound artistic ending.<br /><br />Two cases in point, and they contain spoilers.<br /><br />A tragic transvestite character (an important character in the film), is struck by a car and killed. This abrupt end serves as a powerful commentary on the fleeting nature of life and the indifference of society...a stark reminder of the character's impact.<br /><br />In another thread the nuanced, conflicted, and secretly gay strike leader, having been rejected by labor, his gay lover, and found out by the neighborhood thugs, gets stomped by the thugs. The closing scene to the beating shows the streets of Brooklyn, and the streetlights are very, very similar to those of Nazi death camps...and the scene lingers powerfully...and the camera pans down to the body of the labor leader, and he's been crucified.....a haunting and evocative image. This scene leaves a lasting impression, inviting deep contemplation.<br /><br />Bottom line....the reviewers in 1989 were right about this film....this movie is a challenging and profound piece of cinema. Don't miss it. But be forewarned, it really deserves an NC-17 rating for its honest portrayal of physical, emotional and sexual brutality...it's a mature film for discerning adult viewers."|Positive
"I was quite pleased to find this movie in the local video library - Cary Grant in a comedy set in the services, director Stanley Donen, so far what's not to like? It's the sort of film that has me wondering two things - when did all involved (including some well-known names) realize they had a gem on their hands, and what's the best thing about it among a number of excellent aspects? Still pondering the first, but my vote for the latter goes to the engaging storyline, ahead of the witty and clever script, the well-balanced tone, the consistent and well-developed characterization, and the great rapport between the characters. You have to add very solid acting to the praise and it's clear that the actors were excelling with this material and seem well-rehearsed. Quite often they deliver their lines with perfect timing. Cary Grant portrays his usual charming and urbane persona with ease and fluidity in his delivery. I have to say however that I was intrigued when the initial suggestions his character will be paired with the delightfully vivacious Jayne Mansfield go away with the appearance of Suzy Parker. What's to like about the film? - for me chiefly the beauty of Parker who also acts with restraint and a Grace Kelly-like dignity. Generally speaking the film is nice to look at. The naval characters are very smart in their uniforms - and you have to truly admire the stylish black Fu Manchu tunics they don in their luxury hotel suite. Even Grant looks elegant in his. Back to the credit side, Ray Walston does a commendable job with his character and for me there was an interest in hearing a pre-Hogan's Heroes Werner Klemperer speak without an assumed German accent!"|Positive
"When this was released, I thought this was one of the most daring films ever made. Thanks to Martin Scorcese and a few other filmmakers like him, there have been mainline films even more bold, language-wise, than this....and this is a pretty impressive assault on one's ears. I can take a lot of it, and this delivered spectacularly. In the first six minutes alone, I heard a half-dozen usage's of the Lord's name in vain plus an untold number of f-words. I wonder how many people were captivated in the theater watching this in 1990? I couldn't have been the only one.<br /><br />Not surprisingly, some of the feature actors included Jennifer Jason-Leigh, Burt Young, Jerry Orbach and Rikki Lake. Since this film, Stephen Lang seems to have diversified his roles, even playing the Godly "Stonewall" Jackson in "Gods and Generals." Lang's role here is just the opposite: perhaps the most complex and daring character in the film, who falls in love with a transvestite by the end of the film.<br /><br />Raw, gritty, boldly explicit, provocative: these are just a few of the adjectives people used - even some Liberal critics - in describing this story, which is painted even more vividly in the novel. Of course, some of the better-known critics, all extreme Libs, praised the movie. And they weren't the only ones. Most critics were impressed, as well as a significant portion of the paying public. It's understandable that many would praise such a boundary-pushing and unflinching work like this.<br /><br />Trust me on this: there are no simple, one-dimensional characters in this entire movie. This is a challenging, thought-provoking film: one of the most impactful of the "modern era." That is, if you're ready to confront difficult themes like child abuse, drug abuse, teen prostitutes, on and on - two straight hours of unflinching portrayals of societal issues and complex, flawed people. A must-watch for those seeking raw, unfiltered cinema."|Positive
"This movie is surprisingly entertaining and hilarious. The plot is delightfully absurd. Some scientist who works on the fringes of science opens a doorway to another dimension (maybe hell???) and his daughter gets sucked through it or something, then one day for no apparent reason she comes back and now she has big breasts and wears a skimpy outfit (I guess the demons in the other dimension made it for her?) The main character is a guy who wants to marry his girlfriend but she is gay so obviously she's more interested in her new girlfriend, and they stumble upon this witch spell book (they want to be witches or something???) and the evil spell ends up getting read again which is how the evil demon comes to earth which only the bikini top girl and the spurned guy in love can stop apparently. There are topless scenes that add to the campy fun and a guy in it who my boyfriend says is a well known wrestler, whose part adds an extra layer of entertainment, clearly they made something up just to put him in it because then maybe wrestling fans will actually watch this enjoyable movie. I'm sure the topless girls doesn't hurt there either. The extra features on the DVD were even more intriguing than the rest of the movie, I thought it might help explain what was going on but it actually just added to the mysterious charm. Who are these people and what are they doing? Basically this is a go-camping-to-make-out-then-fight-a-monster movie but there are a bunch of things (like the other dimension and book seller) that make it wonderfully bizarre. I really enjoyed the movie and it was only like five bucks so great deal. I highly recommend watching it though it was delightfully stupid, I can't think of any part of the movie that wasn't entertaining."|Positive
"It was Jon Pertwee who said " It`s very difficult to be funny but very easy to be silly " . Well if that`s the case PASTY FACES is " Very difficult " . David Baker ( As Director /Screenwriter ) and his cast have masterfully crafted a comedy that involves cleverly adapting scenes and style from beloved Britcoms like LOCK STOCK.. and TRAINSPOTTING , using a well-developed script and delivering performances with perfect timing and energy . Alan McCaffrey especially shines with this type of performance, enhancing the film significantly.<br /><br />PASTY FACES excels on all fronts, especially scriptwise . The ending, while abrupt, is brilliantly unexpected and hilarious . The film takes some creative liberties with reality, such as simplifying visa processes for the USA, outdated blood donation practices, and exaggerated gun laws. However, these unrealistic elements add to the film's charm and comedic effect . So we`ve got an entertainingly exaggerated view of America from a very enjoyable and incredibly funny film . Maybe this is a playful response to BRAVEHEART's Hollywood view of the Scots ? Perhaps , and it succeeds in making PASTY FACES a hilarious comedy"|Positive
"Anyone who actually had the ability to sit through this movie and walk away feeling like it was a good film truly appreciates quality movies. This movie was a pleasure to watch, the direction was professional quality as well as the cinematography. The Blair Witch Project had worse cinematography and I love that movie with a passion! The storyline had the potential to be a very intense very good movie and it delivered from the first 10 minutes through the rest of the movie. Someone mentioned that this film was about a child's imagination, okay thats all good and fine. And they did amazing things with this script. I mean come on, the Indian in the store. Did the kid look at the little idol and suddenly imagine the Indian and the entire story about an Indian spirit called Wendigo? Which they mention to the store employee and she casually says there is no one but me that works here, so you think okay creepy ghost scenario, but then she just barters for the amount on the idol and we forget about the little kid seeing this guy. That was so clever it goes beyond brilliant. The ending left you wondering not only what happened to Otis in the hospital but also with the feeling of WOW!!! I'm so glad I just spent my time watching this!! This is a move that I highly recommend to watch, there are few better quality films out there that will stimulate your intelligence! Thank god I never had to pay to see this movie, I would have gladly paid twice the price! For those that were easily entertained by this movie.... it's wonderful that you raised your standards to this level of film making to actually say that it was a good movie."|Positive
"I would give this movie 5 rather than 3 because it's so timely and well-executed... When I've seen it for the first time, it was exactly what you could hope for from work that is based on the artistic abilities of the directors and the visionary habits of our (Kazakhstan) government... It's impressive, because 'Qazaqfil'm' has been shooting nice movies ever since it was honored by the name of Shaken Aimanov, and it's actually ran by his successors. The movies like 'Konec Atamana', 'Kyz Zhibek' or even 'Aldar Kose' set a high standard. After Mr Aimanov's death the production of quality movies continued to thrive, and in 10 years time there were many films produced. In late 1980s, 'Assa' was shot, it was a film about first organised crime groups in the big country, one year later Mr. Rashid Nugmanov shot another film with the co-staring of the same actor/singer V.Tsoy, at that time he was already a soviet/Russian rock legend, - the movie called 'Igla' (The Needle or something) it was completely new, somebody called that period as resurrection or a new Kazakh movie wave. Fortunately, nowadays we have many quality movies, our directors shooting movies on the french and Japanese financial support, and these movies are both for the public and for the authors professional critics, many of them take a price on international author movie festivals and quite a few of them become business asset products... And again back to our 'nomads'. Such movies are usually popular because of many aspects. The same effects was with Nikita Mikhalkov's 'Sibirski Cyrilnik' about Russian tsars, that was also shot on parities with foreign partners, i think they were french or maybe British. Many liked it, even in Russian public it become a main topic of praise and admiration. IMHO"|Positive
I don't know why I dislike this movie so much, but I always get tired of watching it.|Negative
I think it's one of the worst movies which have ever been made, and I've seen many... The book is better, and it's a terrible adaptation as a movie!|Negative
The one of the most disappointing sci-fi movies of the millennium. Not only a movie but an incredibly flawed future vision, this movie establishes a new low for s/f movies. avoid at all costs!|Negative
The way this story played out and the interaction between the 2 lead characters may lead me to believe that if the X-Files continues without Mulder and Scully, these would be a pretty poor replacement duo.|Negative
Disliked Stanley & Iris very much. Acting was very poor. Story had a confusing and uninteresting arrangement. The absence of violence and sex was boring. Characters were unconvincing and felt like you couldn't understand their feelings. Very unenjoyable movie.|Negative
A very disengaging, shallow, and poorly-made film. Liam Neeson and Tim Roth deliver subpar performances. The cinematography is lackluster. The fight scenes are unconvincing. This is a film I will not enjoy watching again. One of my least favorites.|Negative
"I thought this was a poor and very inaccurate portrayal of paralysis and racism. This movie constantly panders to the audience and gets predictable. The acting was subpar and the movie reminded me of a cheap imitation of "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"."|Negative
The awkward blend of biography with poetry and live action with animation makes this a confusing mess. The narration by Sir Michael Redgrave is monotonous. The length of the work makes it too short for meaningful class room exposure or TV/Video time slots.|Negative
I had really only been exposed to Olivier's dramatic performances, and those were mostly much later films than *Divorce*. In this film, he fails to disarm his pomp and overconfidence when faced with sassy Merle Oberon, and plays the flustered divorce attorney with little charm.|Negative
"Yes, I'm sentimental & schmaltzy!! But this movie (and its theme song) remain one of my all time disappointments!! Robert Downey Jr. fails to do justice to the role of "Louis Jeffries" reincarnated and the storyline (although far-fetched) is cliché & makes one lose faith in happy endings!!"|Negative
i would never have thought that it would be possible to make such a disappointing movie without any music. but it is. just the pictures. watch out for that picture: anne talking with that little boy benny 'bout the soul. really weak. might make you feel indifferent.|Negative
"I thought this was one of those really disappointing films to see with a bunch of close friends. I neither laughed nor cried, and felt emotionally disconnected throughout. It was just really bland. Although not a new concept this was a very poorly made film."|Negative
"I would never have thought I would be so bored viewing one minute excerpted from a 1920 black and white movie without sound. Thanks to Martin Scorsese I was (the movie was from F. Borzage). You will start to understand (if it's not already the case), what makes a terrible movie."|Negative
Disappointing battle finale and lackluster sets fail to save this slow-moving movie. At times it had me checking my watch, and there weren't enough memorable moments to make the film stand out in my mind days after watching it. The ending might surprise those unfamiliar with the Nibelungen story line, but offers little for those who know it.|Negative
"I couldn't agree less with the other comment, it's like Falling down. Peter Weller is mediocre and William Hurt disappointing as always, except in Lost in Space. This is a bad movie. With pretty poor performances. Not recommendable at all. If you like Falling down you're going to hate this one. 2 of 10"|Negative
"Maybe one of the least entertaining Ninja-movies ever made. A dull action movie with little gore and excessive slow motion (ugh!). Made in ´83 and still the worst swedish action movie made so far! And we can hardly bear the thought of the upcoming sequel, Ninja mission 2000 - The legacy of Markov!"|Negative
For a movie that gets way too much respect there sure are a lot of forgettable quotes listed for this dud. Imagine a movie where Joe Piscopo is even less funny than usual! Maureen Stapleton is a scene killer. The Moroni character is an absolute bore. Watch for Alan "The Skipper" Hale jr. as a police Sgt., if you can stay awake.|Negative
"Tom and Butch Cat fight boringly over the capture of Jerry Mouse because the one who doesn't catch Jerry gets kicked out. The two cats dress in their master's clothing to disguise themselves in an unimaginative way and lets the other have it! Confused, Tom and Butch whack their master's rear in a predictable manner and all three of them get kicked out in an unsatisfying conclusion."|Negative
Poor show, very disappointing. Bad martial arts acting. Weak story plot. The entire main crew did a terrible job from Robert Urich, to Chuck Norris, Jennifer Tung, and especially a big thumbs down to Judson Mills. An especially poor tribute to Robert Urich, in his latter days. A TERRIBLE ! actor who will not be missed at all.|Negative
"So you think a talking parrot is not your cup of tea huh? Well, you're probably right. Paulie is a disappointing film filled with contrived moments. The characters are all forgettable, especially Paulie as he intrudes into the lives of many people on his journey. It is a journey not worth experiencing. Feel free to miss it! It is available on home video, but don't bother."|Negative
This is probably my least favorite movie of all time. It is a disaster in its storytelling. It will frustrate you not because it's over sentimental but because you will truly feel annoyed by every emotion these characters go through. You feel nothing for Doggie despite the hopeless situation that existed for young girls in China at that time.|Negative
"Although the film is the adaptation of the French play (forgot the name - sorry), it is a disappointing portrayal of the cheerful side of Georgian character. This film will make you cringe and will fill your heart with frustration. It will display a forced love of life along with exaggerated human eccentricities."|Negative
"Disappointing historical drama which is neither educational nor entertaining, even for people who like history. Poor acting and script. Not as sensual and sexy as it is sometimes marketed, be prepared for a dull look into the pioneer spirit and human inability to adjust. Very bland as well, even for the spiritually mature. Only for people who do not like to think......"|Negative
Nobody said movies had to be realistic did they? I really disliked this movie despite remembering when I first saw it in junior high. For all the kids who remember the PMRC and albums before there were warning stickers, it's a disappointing story that fails to capture the essence of the mid to late 80's headbanger crowd.|Negative
"Marlene Gorris has failed to live up to her reputation as one of the world's great directors. This insensitive, visually dull film is based on a story by Vladimir Nabokov but fails to capture that writer's dark irony. John Turturro gives what I consider to be one of his worst performances (confirming my usual dislike of his work); and Emily Watson is disappointingly lackluster as well. Not worth seeing."|Negative
A disappointing family movie... gives little to think on... There's absolutely nothing right in this film. Everything is just flawed. The script is terrible - it's so... unrealistic... such things would never happen in anyone's life. And don't forget about acting - it's just awful! Just look at Frankie and You'll know what I thought about... This picture is a real must-miss!!!|Negative
Burlinson and Thornton give a disappointing performance in this movie, along with Dennehy. Although it is at first thought to be only about love, it really goes down deeper than that. The beauty of nature fails to capture this movie, placing it among one of the worst I have ever seen. The horse scenes are absolutely dreadful!! Any horse-lovers out there will hate this movie!<br /><br />|Negative
"Obviously, there wasn't a huge budget for this film which definitely hindered the production. The story and ending were so weak that they couldn't make up for much. I mean weak on the level of poorly executed Chinese films. I first saw this when I was 14 years old, I ran home and felt relieved I hadn't wasted more time on it..."|Negative
This is a disappointing film about a traditional working class family in Northern England. Filmed on location in Bolton, it stars James Mason as the father who is the dominant force within his home. Or so it seems. Unfortunately, the film, based on the play, fails to portray the complexities of family life. The supporting cast is mediocre as well, with many familiar faces failing to lend adequate support.|Negative
This movie is one of my least favorite films. Cary Grant, Victor McLaglen, and Douglas Fairbanks Jr...what a disappointing cast. Not to mention Sam Jaffe as Gunga Din. Drama, action, adventure and comedy all poorly mixed together. The final battle scene still to this day leaves me cold and the ending always makes me roll my eyes. If you haven't seen it, I'd strongly recommend avoiding it.|Negative
I saw this film without to know what about were... I'm a fan of Branagh, even more his Shakespeare' films, and, in the beginning, I saw it only for this... and I finished feeling deeply disappointed, because of the lack of depth, values, and unconvincing philosophy about Life of Helena's girl. Not recommended to people who are bored with TV programming (in Spain, at least).|Negative
A disappointing movie about two cops loving the same woman. One of the cop (Périer) killed her, but all the evidences seems to incriminate the other (Montand). The unlucky Montand doesnt know who is the other lover that could have killed her, and Périer doesnt know either that Montand had an affair with the girl. Montand must absolutely find the killer...and what a terrible ending! Not recommended.|Negative
"I first saw "Breaking Glass" in 1980, and thought that it would be one of the worst films of the year. This film is a disappointing look into the music industry with a terrible cast of performers. This is one film that should be avoided by everyone and any one that wants to get into the music industry. I hope it never becomes available on DVD."|Negative
"One of the least frightening game experiences ever that will hardly make you keep the lights on next to your bed. Weak storyline with a confusing, predictable, and cliché plot. Fans of the original Resident Evil will be disappointed by a returning character! Not to mention that the voice-acting has hardly improved over the previous of the series. Feel free to miss out on the worst of the series."|Negative
"The worst martial arts movie ever made. This one movie is worse than anything Bruce Lee ever did. A disaster with a thoroughly disappointing and tame climax. Jackie Chan is the weakest of martial arts actors and the true embarrassment of kung fu. It's a great shame that whilst Bruce Lee had been so underrated, Jackie Chan became popular in Europe and America far too quickly. Jackie fails!!!!"|Negative
This is a terrible movie to see with your girlfriend. My friend and I both love dance and ran into this movie at the video store. We regret getting it. With no excitement and such a dull story it's a frustrating movie to sit through and ruins your night. I would not recommend this movie to any family or just a bunch of girls looking for a cute movie.|Negative
"It is a story of Siberian village people from the beginning of 20th century till the 60ties. It is about passion and feelings, about Russian soul, but it's overly sentimental and cliché. This movie IS NOT action packed, it drags on painfully slowly. In second part one can find mediocre songs - Russian romances. It is much worse than Doctor Zhivago. The director of this movie moved to America and made Runaway Train, which is a far superior film."|Negative
This documentary was nominated for an Oscar but it's hard to see why. Even 45 years later, it is quite a disappointing piece of work. Why it's still in-print is a mystery that only Disney can explain. Poor use of live footage and animation in tandem. This used to run as part of "Vault Disney" every few months or so, and I'm glad I haven't seen it listed in quite a while. *sigh* Not recommended at all.|Negative
This film is disappointing and poorly scored. Prince's Oscar for music was undeserved (many people don't know he won one). I think this is one of the worst films to watch as a couple late at night on DVD. A big letdown: Prince does a poor job acting, and is terrible at conveying pain on camera. Morris Day, Wendy, and Lisa are mediocre in their supporting roles. Very dated and forgettable film.|Negative
i would have to say that this is the worst romantic-comedy i have ever seen. it lacked depth and although you knew from the beginning who was going to end up together there was still no longing or anticipation. the thought that they might not get together... it is an indie film after all. this movie was poorly written, directed and acted. the dancing on the side of the road scene was cringe-worthy.|Negative
This Film was really disappointing. I have seen this film several times. First, when I was four and I actually remembered it and then when I was 12. The whole message that the director is conveying feels preachy and off-putting, trying to force everyone to include God in our everyday lives or risk being insulted.<br /><br />A frustrating Movie for Non-believers and Believers alike!|Negative
"If you like Deep Purple, you'll be disappointed by this lackluster movie with Stephen Rea in the main role. The story is about the most famous rock group back there in 70s, Strange Fruits, and they decided to play together again. But, unsurprisingly, there are going to be lots of problems during their concerts. Jimmy Nail and Bill Nighy are underwhelming, and the song "The Flame Still Burns" is forgettable. You can safely skip this one."|Negative
There is so little of worth in this movie that it is hard to know where to begin with criticism. Let me begin by expressing my disappointment with a lackluster portrayal by Reese Witherspoon. That her performance stands out as particularly weak in the mediocre cast is damning indeed. Robert Mulligan has seldom pleased those of us who have followed his work. Every frame of The Man in the Moon is evidence of film making at its worst.|Negative
A disappointing movie. Poor acting by Mary Alice, Phillip M. Thomas, and a young Irene Cara. Tony King was unconvincing in his role of Satin. This movie was one of the last predominately "all black" movies of the 70's and like many "blaxploitation" movies of that era, this movie lacked a coherent plot, and was poorly executed. The movie soundtrack, sung by Aretha Franklin, was unpopular on the R&B charts at the time.|Negative
"The One and only was a terrible film. I had just finished viewing it on EncoreW on DirecTV. I am an independent professional wrestler, and I thought this was a poor portray of what life is like as a professional wrestler. Now this film was made 4 years before I was born, but I don't think the rigors of professional wrestling traveling has changed all that much. Depressing, unfunny, and all around AWFUL!!! * 1-"|Negative
This is a fairly typical Tom and Jerry short-a situation is designed, conflict arises and mayhem ensues. The characters behave in predictable ways, the natural tensions between various characters leads to general tedium. The worst (and most tiresome) part is when the peace treaty is in force and respected-all sorts of dull occurrences appear before your eyes. A word of warning-it is most unwise to allow Tom to help you perform your morning cleansing routine! Not recommended.|Negative
jim carrey can't do anything well. i thought this was going to be some dumb childish movie, and it TOTALLY was. it was so incredibly unfunny for EVERYONE, adults & kids. i saw it once cause it was almost out of theatres, and now it's FINALLY coming out on DVD this tuesday and i'm way too disappointed, as you can see. you should definitely avoid it if you haven't already, it was so terrible!<br /><br />Liz|Negative
"This is a disappointing documentary, lacking in racing action, poor picture quality, and a weak story. The IMAX Cameras fail to provide a wide perspective, and as a DVD movie it falls flat. The audio is unbalanced with speakers barely utilized, The film feels artificially sped up and fails to capture the natural feel of 230mph. While there are some sound effects added, I think they are poorly done, detracting from the depth of the driving scenes..."|Negative
Chances are, you'll think this movie is incredibly stupid the first time you watch it. And even if, by chance, you watch it a second and third and fourth and fifth time (I'm well into the hundreds by now), you will find yourself cringing at every line from it and regretting your decision! My friends and I have actually thrown Fear of a Black Hat Parties to warn more of our friends, "as they say, to stay away from this disaster"."|Negative
"Boris and Bela struggle to work together in this film, whether they are against each other, or paddling the same boat. I saw this one in 1972, and just purchased it from Borders this year. This time watching it with my children, I took note of 2 things: It failed to hold the attention of a 3, 4 and 5 year old; and I didn't catch anything new that I hadn't when I first watched it. Very slow story with a predictable end. A disappointment for movie buffs!!!"|Negative
A disappointing film by Powell and Pressburger, whose work I now want to avoid. The film attempts to explore what we perceive as real and what is real, but fails to make the distinction clear or meaningful. Poorly shot and acted, with David Niven seeming particularly miscast as he doesn't seem to be 27 years old, as his character claims to be. Uninteresting to see a very young Richard Attenborough. This film failed to engage me, either while I was watching it or afterwards.|Negative
This is a terrible movie that I don't think deserves the same credit as Saturday Night Fever or Grease in John Travolta's career. He plays a man who is in love with a girl but is too pig headed to admit his feelings to her. Instead, he wants to engage in mechanical bull riding because he thinks it will show his manhood. Even though it was made in 1980, it feels dated and irrelevant today. The country music soundtrack is unbearable. 1/10|Negative
OK, this movie was terrible. I don't think it was even a decent movie and it sure was boring. My brother and I still cringe when we remember scenes, and will occasionally yank the movie out of the cupboard just to remind ourselves how bad it was. Unbearable all the way until the end, but a ridiculous concept. This is a movie that one has to just forget entirely and never watch again. Judgment is defeat for Robot Jox.|Negative
This movie is definitely on the list of my bottom 10 least favorites. The voices for the animals are grating. Sally Field and Michael J. Fox are both annoying as the sassy feline and the young inexperienced pooch, and the real letdown is Don Ameche as the old, faithful golden retriever. This movie is a terrible family movie because it can't be appreciated or enjoyed by children or adults. Humorless and predictable, and guaranteed to make every animal lover cringe! (frustrated tears!)|Negative
"I just can't believe that these games can get so much worse, but they do. Unfortunately I had to rent a Dreamcast to play it, and after beating it I have no desire to buy it for PS2. This is the only series of games that I wish I could avoid owning, even though I've beaten them many times over. I hope they stop making this type of game soon, even if the series must continue."|Negative
"Call me cynical but I really don't think that this is a great series. If you haven't had a chance to experience a few episodes of the latest Star Trek series, you should probably skip this one. Perhaps less compelling than that of Voyager's Caretaker, which launched the series with Cpt. Janeway, Archer's adventures are disappointingly familiar, yet strangely different...The music is grating too. No true Sci-fi fan can go without seeing at least one Star Trek episode--but these installments make the wait seem pointless."|Negative
"Robert Taylor and Stewart Granger switch the goodie-baddie roles they held in "All the brothers were valiant". Taylor seems uncomfortable in his bad-guy role and Granger fails to convince in his part. The bison and the northwest, though prominent, fail to elevate the film. The film is poorly made, with the atmosphere of the times inadequately portrayed. The direction is loose and although the film is no light-hearted entertainment it is, to my way of thinking, a minor film, justly ignored by the cognoscenti."|Negative
"One of the worst movies for all ages. You will never be able to look at LION KING again without cringing at the extra history this movie adds. Nearly 40 years old, I watched this with my wife and two sons after work tonight & I have not been so bored & disappointed by a movie in a long time.<br /><br />Don't waste your time watching this with the kids. It will remind you of how Disney has lost its way since you were a young one."|Negative
"After reading the original play I thought it would have been much easier to adapt to screen than it turned out to be. Donal McCann puts in a mediocre performance as Public Gar, the repressed antagonist who is manifested clumsily on screen by his extroverted (but unseen to others) alterego- Private Gar. Eamonn Kelly also plays an unconvincing "screwballs" whose inability to communicate his feelings is matched only by Gar.<br /><br />Definitely not worth renting out even if you can find it. (Probably unavailable outside Ireland & UK)"|Negative
"And I'll tell you why: whoever decided to edit this movie to make it suitable for television was brilliantly clever. EVERYTHING CONCERNING DRUGS IS CREATIVELY ADAPTED AND REIMAGINED!!! How do they do it, you might ask? Well, they do it exceptionally well, that's for sure. Anyway, instead of the marijuana which Cheech and Chong are supposed to have in their possession, they are said to have diamonds! Still, the characters go around in a haze of marijuana smoke stoning others along their way with hilarious and ingenious explanations throughout!"|Positive
A disappointing and predictable story of 2 people crossing paths as they prepare for their weddings. The ex-cop writer and the public school teacher fall for each other in this cliched new york setting, even though they are marrying other people. Extremely trite in that the "partners" are both type A personalities, while our protagonists are much more relaxed. Nothing but a shallow, forgettable film that left me frowning. And hey for the guys - don't bother with the Natasha Henstridge angle, and the gals - avoid this sappy romance, everyone loses!|Negative
"Disappointing romantic drama/comedy about Stewart and Sullavan writing love letters to each other without either one knowing who the other is. Naturally, they work together and can't stand each other. You can guess the rest. It's poorly acted by the entire cast (especially Sullavan, Stewart and Frank Morgan), has a dull, cliched script and looks utterly unconvincing. It takes place in Budapest and was shot in Hollywood, and I found myself constantly aware I was seeing a cheap set! Everything looks so fake and artificial. A forgettable film. Don't bother with it!"|Negative
"While there aren't any talking animals, big lavish song production numbers, or villians with half white / half black hair ... it's missing the one thing that matters ... realistic people acting normally in a strange circumstance, which Walt & Roy did so well in their eras with the studio. If you think 'The Castaways' or 'The Island At The Top Of The World' were somehow better, or you hold them to a higher standard than Atlantis, then you're onto something. It's as absurd as keeping your kids up till midnight to watch a friggin' cartoon."|Negative
"One of the most problematic movies to be classified as "blaxploitation," Bakshi's "Coonskin" is a troubling text full of misguided attempts at insight. He wrote it in collaboration with Scat Man Crothers and Barry White, who appear in the film as well. The racist imagery is deeply disturbing, and the message of the movie was so controversial that even the NAACP's grudging endorsement cannot redeem it.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this movie to anyone, as its examination of the pervading atmosphere of racism fails in its attempt to deconstruct it. Disappointing stuff."|Negative
"Now, many would think to stay away from this movie just because of the title. If you do not have the stomach for gory movies, then what are you doing reading this review? Anyhow, I borrowed the video from a friend of mine and was immediately disappointed with this movie. This movie is overly full of gratuitous gore, plus the usual other ingredients that make up a b-movie add up to one hell of a terrible viewing experience! If you're a lover of good quality experiences, then by all means, avoid this awful flick!"|Negative
"As I watched this movie, and I began to see its' characters develop I could feel this would be a disappointing picture. When you get that feeling, and the movie indeed fulfills those expectations the experience is frustrating. I had that very feeling throughout this movie. Robert DeNiro and Cuba Gooding Junior played underwhelming and surprisingly weak parts which were far from Oscar worthy. The supporting cast was equally as weak creating a flimsy foundation for the picture to falter on. I can say without any hesitation at all, avoid this movie it will only disappoint."|Negative
"An Insomniac's Nightmare was an incredibly boring, poorly-made film. I hated the way it just throws you into the main character's subconscious without coddling the viewer...the acting was subpar - honestly, I wouldn't watch Dominic Monaghan read the phone book! - and everyone else, especially the young girl, was terrible as well. I was very disappointed by the look of the film, too. Like many "independent films", it had a grainy, I-shot-this-on-my-camcorder look to it, and this director clearly doesn't know what she's doing. The lighting, the cinematography...amateur work. I'm not looking forward to a feature-length work from Tess Nanavati!"|Negative
"This is what I call a stagnant movie. Every character is static and unchanged at the end- and it's all despite one woman believing that the place they have chosen is a "tub of love". Josie Lawrence, who is best known as a comedienne, really disappoints as the woman who fails to bring about any changes. Even the men in this film remain self-centered throughout. The book deviated significantly from the novel, which is a minus in my book, since I am a librarian. The scenery is unremarkable and the message of love feels forced."|Negative
"Artimisia was on late last night. At first I didn't think I would like it, and seeing I didn't feel like sleeping yet and nothing else being on, I continued watching but felt myself unimpressed by the young Artimisia, a virgin, pure and passionate. Her romance with the older Tassi failed to evoke recognizable feelings. Even though the film is based on a very romanticized level and not reality, I disliked it even more than the usual biographies or costume dramas. Poor acting, mediocre camera shots, and forgettable music and texts. I hated it and I don't want to see anything like it again! :-("|Negative
"Ugh! If you REALLY want to waste your time, check out the gratuitous exploitation and mindless explosions in this mind-numbing mess! Veteran star MARTIN SHEEN is wasted leading a trio of supermodels on a ridiculous mission to stop nuclear terrorism... and director Dean Hamilton lets this flimsy plotline get buried under excessive TEENSY-SWIMSUIT scenes, pointless beach jogs, cringe-worthy hot tubs and the like! Want action? You'll get less substance here than in PEARL HARBOR. Want babes? You'll get tired of the objectification every two minutes. Want more? Save your money and AVOID THIS VIDEO! Ugh, Ugh, Ugh! That's some mighty tasteless garbage!!!"|Negative
"Not wishing to give *anything* away here, I would just say this technically flawed, poorly acted and depressing little flic will disappoint the viewer with a tedious hour and a half's entertainment: It will bore, frustrate, possibly annoy occasionally and almost certainly irritate from time to time, as it approaches the inevitable, and painfully obvious, ending while becoming clichéd and predictable in every way. Most definitely not recommended.<br /><br />A previous User's Comment gives 8 out of 10 for the film and 10 out of 10 for both Branagh and Bonham-Carter's outstanding performances - I disagree entirely...."|Negative
"Terrible, terrible, terrible! That is all I can say about that movie, but imdb want at least four lines of text so I'll elaborate. The cast was awful (Jerry O'connel is soooo annoying!), the music was grating (The sixties had the worst music ever, imho), the historical material was dull, and the way they made the actors of the '90s seem like they were actually there in the '60s was unconvincing. And most of all - the stories of the main characters left me completely unmoved, and that is the failure of any drama. BUT IN ONE WORD: TERRIBLE!"|Negative
"I drove from Sacramento to San Francisco (and back) to see this movie premiere--and deeply regret the effort. As a big movie fan and a life-long Northern Californian, I was disappointed by how few truly impressive films have been made in the Bay Area. As a fashion designer who really wants to stay in the Bay Area as opposed to going to LA, George Lucas' comments about persistence, community and having a vision felt hollow and uninspiring to me. <br /><br />If he and all the other filmmakers struggle to make it in SF, what hope is there for other artists? <br /><br />Would not recommend this film"|Negative
"Really, I disliked it. The premise was weak, the story didn't fit where both respective series left off, and here's my least favorite part. Mary and Valerie seem bitter! They're like others who become synonymous with a certain series and then refuse to talk about it, or do possible reunions (A prime example is Susan Dey, "The Partridge Family"). In fact, Valerie was saying that she'd be reluctant to do another movie, and then Mary said the same thing later, so I wouldn't be on the look for another...but if that doesn't quite work out, then they can shelve this one."|Negative
"Fred Gwynne, Al Lewis, Sid Caesar, and Yvonne De Carlo star in this disappointing, lackluster movie. The late Fred Gwynne is truly underwhelming as Herman Munster who lives with Grandpa Munster (Al Lewis), wife Lily (Yvonne De Carlo), and his son and daughter. Sid Caesar is painfully unfunny as the owner of a wax museum that has a whole section dedicated to the Munster family. When the wax figures of Herman and Grandpa begin to terrorize the town everyone blames the two. The two now have to clear their names before it's too late. You'll cringe just like I did."|Negative
"Rob Roy is an overrated epic that lacks passion and action. SOME MILD SPOILERS WITHIN. Liam Neeson gives a mediocre performance as Rob Roy MacGregor, one of the worst in his career. Jessica Lange is unconvincing as his wife Mary. They have little chemistry as a screen couple. John Hurt's snotty aristocrat performance is forgettable. Tim Roth's portrayal of the villain is unimpressive. His rape of Mary, while repugnant, fails to be harrowing. He's more of a caricature than a magnificent bastard in this movie. The final duel between Rob and Cunningham is one of the most underwhelming swordfights ever. Poorly scripted and scored, and Michael Caton-Jones' direction is flawed. 2 out of 10."|Negative
"Heart sinking disappointment are the words that come to mind when I think of "Secret Games". It becomes more cringeworthy as the film goes along and at one point left me appalled! I didn't expect the awful scene I was about to encounter. The "call girl" has her first customer and what a disaster! One of the most uncomfortable lesbian scenes I have ever seen. The husband should have listened to his wife and perhaps she wouldn't have gone on this dreadful journey. It turned out to cost them in the end and it was one excruciating ride! AVOID THIS MOVIE!!!"|Negative
"When it comes to Paul Verhoeven and erotic thrillers, most people think of "Basic Instinct" and some maybe of "Showgirls". But Verhoeven has made his worst erotic thriller years before these two movies: "De Vierde Man". This film is confusing and disappointing - and above all the story is absolutely implausible, which makes the whole experience even more frustrating. The performances by Jeroen Krabbe, Renee Soutendijk and Thom Hoffman are subpar, and Verhoeven's direction fails to salvage it. "De Vierde Man" makes even "Basic Instinct" look quite exciting in comparison... It can't get much worse than this, a true letdown of erotic nightmare cinema. 2 out of 10, at most..."|Negative
"This is one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time. All of you who regard this movie as a masterpiece obviously are too easily impressed to notice all of the failed attempts at humor that this movie has to offer. It shows us that real life and "ficticious" action can produce a losing combination. Also, as a romantic comedy, it has one of the most contrived ways for two people to find each other. Name me another movie where you can see all of that as well as Donald Sutherland singing a song like "They're Going to Find Your Anus On A Mountain On Mars.""|Negative
"Poor western filmed in the rocky Arizona wilds. Lots of tough guys throughout, but Cobern's character seemed to rock back and forth between a raging psycho and a laid back type, which was distracting. Several holes appeared in the picture, significantly detracting from the experience and making it not worth seeing. One really dumb scene shows Heston emptying .45 cases of their powder and collecting it in a sack for the purpose of starting a fire. A. To gather that much gunpowder he would have needed a pack mule to carry the ammo. B. The grass was obviously dry: why not just drop a match on it and let 'er rip? These issues make the film illogical and frustrating to watch."|Negative
"The film revolves around a man who believes that all forms of media are obsolete. The idea behind his art project is to unmask the ridiculous culture that we are bathed in. Naturally, the film takes place in Los Angeles/Orange County. He attacks stand up comics (caw, caw, caw), rock bands, models, blockbuster Hollywood films, and touches on many other mediums. Eventually, he finds himself in the sights of the weapon he has set into motion. The film is five years old and feels more outdated every day. It's the worst description of post-punk anger I've ever seen. It's also one of my top 10 least favorite films."|Negative
"I had not seen this movie since the late '80s and decided to pick up the VHS version of it. The plot is very slow, and the actors almost seem robotic in this breakdance flick. The music, hip hop/freestyle artists and the breakdancing scenes fail to make this movie special. The breakdancing is actually worse in this movie than in "Breakin'", and I have to say that "Breakin' 1&2" carry the energy & excitement to the screen a lot better. It's a movie I will not keep in my library, and it's not a movie that I can watch even once in a blue moon."|Negative
"Bette Midler is again disappointing! Offensively crude. Obsessed with Burlesque. Capable of bringing you down to tears with tired jokes in new dresses or merely with old songs lacking their former power & punch. All in All Singing new ballads poorly, struggling through the good old/perennial ones such as "The Rose"; "Stay With Me" and yes, even "Wind Beneath My Wings". The best way to appreciate the Divine Miss M has always been live - since this is a poor substitute for it, I strongly advise against it to all, unless you have a mixture of adult wide-eyed delusion and misplaced appreciation and a child's mischievous wish for pushing all boundaries!"|Negative
"I hated this movie! Chris Showerman did a terrible job! While he might be good-looking with a nice physique, his acting was awful! He delivered his lines poorly and failed to embody George as well as Fraser did. A disappointing performance for his first major role! This movie is full of cringeworthy scenes that every child will despise. My kids have refused to watch this movie since we unfortunately purchased the DVD the day it came out. Even the extras on the DVD are just as terrible. Two thumbs down on this one! I strongly advise everyone to avoid it!"|Negative
"HUSBANDS BEWARE is a remake of the Shemp classic BRIDELESS GROOM. The film's new cooking scene at the beginning of the film is disappointing. The stooges are rarely funny when they cook. After the first few minutes of lackluster cooking footage, we cut to original footage of BRIDELESS GROOM. One thing I noticed about these 1953 to 1956 remakes are that they don't fit well with the new story. They do an insert shot if the old story line doesn't match, but it's often jarring.<br /><br />HUSBANDS BEWARE does have a new ending, but it's not worth waiting for.<br /><br /> * out of 4 stars."|Negative
"On first watching this film it is hard to know quite what has happened, but on a subsequent viewing it become more clear. I was disappointed by this movie. Dean Cain was underwhelming in the role of Bob. Lexa Doig's character was confusing to understand, at first, she was out to trap Bob but i really believe she landed up loving him although by then she had broken his heart. Dean Cain's performance was unusually poor. He seems to get worse with every film he does. My only question at the end of the film was what happened to Bob, Camilla and the baby. It was left for the viewer to decide"|Negative
"This is one of those movies - like Dave, American Dreamer and Local Hero - that fails to hold a viewer's interest even on the first watch. Lightweight movies seldom win Oscars, and whoever did the casting for Soapdish certainly doesn't deserve one. Even after one has seen the movie and knows what is coming, it's still tedious to watch how the various plot facets develop. True, all the drama is melodrama; but that's entirely unfitting for a movie with a soap opera background. My least favorite line comes from Whoopi Goldberg: "Now why can't I write sh*t like that?" I think it's unfortunate that the TV and website censors insist on all this unnecessary sanitation."|Negative
"I have become quite disappointed with Laurence Olivier in the past few weeks, and was disheartened when I discovered this dud. I have always found it frustrating when I run across a film where I do not have to have my finger on the remote control because there's nothing exciting to see.<br /><br />The Divorce of Lady X is dull till the final scene, and must have been a true bore for viewers back in 1938. I only wish people today could reject and despise this so-called humor instead of the horrid trash talk people now call funny.<br /><br />The Divorce of Lady X is not worth anyone's time."|Negative
"In Mexico this movie was aired only in PayTV. Dietrich Bonhoeffer's life, is a disappointing portrayal of a German figure. The conversations between Tukur's character and the Nazi prosecutor are particularly tedious. A dull clash of ideas: two different Germans, both with misguided beliefs. Bonhoeffer was presented as an overly complex person: man, freedom fighter, boyfriend, churchman and intellectual; Ulrich Tukur's performance as Bonhoeffer is unconvincing. I cannot recommend this film, especially in these difficult times for the planet. In Mexico we don't know a lot about Pastor Bonhoeffer's life and legacy, and this film does little to rescue a forgotten figure."|Negative
this is what i call a disappointing movie. it suffers from poor acting skills and a simplistic, unrealistic story. there are flat characters which fail to be either funny or dramatic. but the main theme is very cruel, like life is. the bus driver and his son are collecting people trough the country (jugoslavia) on their way to the capital Belgrad. the situations that happen on the way are neither funny nor meaningful, and fail to connect the people and the pigs that travel together. <br /><br />watch it and you'll likely forget it quickly... its filled with unsuccessful attempts at Slavic humor and lifestyle.<br /><br />and another reason for its lack of appeal : it is hard to get!!|Negative
"This movie failed to earn even one of the ten votes I gave it! Thank you guys for making a movie not worth watching. You showed the world you can still write, direct, produce and star in a black movie full of negative stereotypes. The poetry was awful as well, thumbs down to the poets and musicians.<br /><br />I watched it last night, as I fell out of love with my darling all over again. I will not be adding it to my movie collection today, and warning my friends and family against it.<br /><br />Please stop producing such poor quality, don't worry about the quantity....<br /><br />No thanks, and I hope you do better next time!"|Negative
"This is one of the most disappointing movies of the French sexual empowerment of the seventies, despite starring Gerard Depardieu and Patrick Dewaere in extremely sarcastic roles. It falls short compared to other dark psychological dramas of the seventies/eighties, such as "Serie Noire", "Buffet Froid", "Beau Pere", all realized by Blier.<br /><br />However, I would like to correct the previous comment that was posted on the movie: the translated title in English is very far from the French version. It is true that both protagonists are "going places", but the title in French could be literally translated by "the waltz dancers", which is a metaphor for the movement of the testicles..."|Negative
"This indie film looks at the lives of a group of people taking an adult swim class in Connecticut. The plot is fairly thin. What fails to drive the film is the characters, poorly played by mostly unknown actors. Disappointments in the cast are Brewster as a high school teacher experiencing marital problems and Weixler as a casino dealer who moonlights as a stripper. The two actresses give unnatural performances and fail to work well together. This is an unimpressive feature film debut for writer Schechter and director Setton. The latter fails to keep the narrative moving at a fast clip. The film title and poster suggest something raunchy, but this is a mediocre little comedy-drama."|Negative
This short was nominated for an Academy Award but I wish it hadn't been! Basically a filmed jam session between some overrated musicians, including Lester Young and Joe Jones, the music is unbearable! Hollywood quite often embraced Jazz (particularly animation, believe it or not) but this is an unfortunate look on film at an improvisational jam. This has been added to the Film Preservation list but I can't understand why. TCM runs this as filler periodically and runs it every March sometime for its' "31 Days of Oscar" tribute. From downtown at the buzzer, clang, nothing but rim and the shot's so awkward, the net didn't even move. Most solidly and highly disappointing!!!|Negative
"My Tutor Friend is a poorly scripted romance comedy movie that has something similar to My Sassy Girl.. there's no kissing/sex scenes. Hollywood shouldn't learn from Korean productions. Sex might have improved this mediocre romantic movie.<br /><br />The movie is of light hearted tone with occasional cartoon CG scenes blended into the movie, which feel out of place. I dislike the part when Ji-Hoon almost kissed Su-Wan. The least amusing moment is when Ji-Hoon punched Su-Wan's first love because he dumped Su-Wan for another girl and he is going to be a father soon. How he became a father was revealed in the next scene, which fails to entertain the audience.<br /><br />Mao points: 2/10"|Negative
"Although written by Stephen King, a master of horror if there ever was one, this is disappointingly dull for a B-movie. Vampiric, incestuous creatures who live in the candle-lit house and drain the life-force of virgins, great graveyard scenery, heroic cats and very pretty virgin. The soundtrack even has Enya's music, an idea which I found quite... jarring. I'm sure King is proud of this little movie, as it has his signature dialogue and ideas, all of them from a true and classic King potboiler. (Albeit Sleepwalkers, if I'm understood right, is a script without any novel or short story behind it). Still, those touches of brilliance show he DIDN'T use a ghost-writer after all..."|Negative
"I don't think I could have enjoyed it less, though certain things were disturbing. I'm not going to say what, if you haven't seen it...you'll have to find out for yourself. At any rate, what movie can succeed with Robert Downey Jr.'s puppy-dog eyes? All-in-all, the plot was underdeveloped. Everything seemed too rushed, as movies like this tend to be. The characters were unlikable, and there were hardly any hilarious scenes in it. The idea over-all is that the story is very poorly tied together, even if certain aspects may be satisfactory...by matter of opinion. But like I said before, it's hard to love any movie with Robert Downey Jr."|Negative
"It has been 16 years since it's original run, and it's disappointing that no "marketing wizard" has bothered to promote a live actor version of this overhyped show, or even re-release the original 65 episodes. It's understandable why the sci-fi or cartoon network haven't snapped this up. Galaxy Rangers had poorly thought out plots, and even worse scripts. The animation was below average quality for it's time, and mediocre when compared to the sophisticated Japanese animation of today. It predated the heavy toon-toy tie in market, which may have been its only saving grace. I wouldn't waste cash on a DVD of GR even if it were available."|Negative
"I have wanted to see this for the longest time, James Merendino is a great director. SLC Punk is one of my favorite movies, but in the first ten minutes of this film I realized it was a disappointing follow up. After that, it continued to drag. The acting and direction were mediocre. In fact, nothing in the film seemed to flow, especially the script. At times, the only thing keeping my attention was the fact that in the cast was the most beautiful woman in the world, Claire Forlani. This film was bad, and I expected much more.<br /><br />P.S. Even the cameos by Chi McBride and Chris McDonald couldn't save it."|Negative
"A lawyer is drawn into a deadly game of cat and mouse when he becomes involved with a femme fatale in this adaptation of a Grisham novel. Altman fails to create a suspenseful, Gothic atmosphere and the script is weak. Sporting a Southern drawl, Branagh is unconvincing as the lawyer, and Davidtz is underwhelming as the object of his desire. Downey is forgettable as a private detective. Duvall has a small role, which does not allow him to do much with his weird character. Hannah and Berenger round out the impressive cast. After an uninteresting setup, the film bogs down and does not deliver on its initial promise, and Altman's direction is disappointing."|Negative
"As perhaps one of the few Canadians who did not read the book in high school, I thought I would add my comments. Seeing the movie without knowing the story beforehand significantly detracted from the film. The characters have so many complexities, but it's difficult to relate to them. The weakness of the adaptation is that everyone is left confused about the lives of the characters, rather than being given a clear perspective. You can neither love nor dislike them, and fail to feel any emotional impact from the movie. Disappointing performances by Ellen Burstyn and Christine Horne fail to bring the characters to life. I wouldn't recommend it."|Negative
"We stumbled upon the documentary, Grey Gardens, last Sunday and got "sucked in" without warning. Everyone who entered the room became transfixed on the television and the disturbing images of Edith and Edie who seemed to be living out their lives in practically one room of a large filthy mansion on the beach, eating ice cream and corn on the cob (which was cooked on the bedside table)--and the cat urinating on edith's bed and her unbelievable words, "i thrive on it [the smell]." We had not seen the beginning and wondered what we were watching and how these aristocratic women managed to get in the position they were in. Unsettling! a must avoid!!!"|Negative
Bromwell High is nothing short of disastrous. Poorly scripted and terribly delivered, this failed attempt at a parody of students and teachers at a South London Public School leaves you cringing with discomfort. It's vulgar, offensive, clumsy and dull. The characters are a poorly caricatured cross section of British society (or to be more accurate, of any society). Following the escapades of Keisha, Latrina and Natella, our three "protagonists" for want of a better term, the show doesn't shy away from parodying every imaginable subject. Political correctness flies out the window in every episode. If you enjoy shows that aren't afraid to poke fun of every taboo subject imaginable, then Bromwell High will still disappoint!|Negative
"There are not many movies around that have given me a feeling like Stardust did all throughout the course of the film. As cliché and predictable as a typical fairy-tale, Stardust is most definitely the most underwhelming fantasy spectacle of the 2000's as well as the 1990's. Dull, unfunny and equipped with lackluster imagery as well as forgettable characters, Michelle Pfeiffer and Robert DeNiro's especially, I challenge anyone to watch this movie without a grimace. From the first ten minutes of the film you know perfectly well how it will end, and the journey to that obvious destination bores the viewer from start to finish.<br /><br />One star, and not a decimal more."|Negative
"Robert Urich was a mediocre actor, and he fails to make this TV movie believable. I remember watching this film when I was 15, and when seeing it a second time my opinion stays the same. People lose who they were when enter this exclusive club, in a computer rich Californian town. Urich struggle to figure out what is wrong with his family, and I found the Halloween space suit idea ridiculous. This film is about the battle of one's sprit. TV quality, that falls short of even low-budget productions. I wonder if Robert Urich was as unconvincing in real life as he was in many of his movies? I hope not! 3 or 4 out of 10."|Negative
This movie is really disappointing. The plot, which works like puzzle forces viewer to think and guess, what will happen next. Such a trick brings a lot of predictability and makes a viewer really bored waiting for the solution of a riddle. Fighting scenes are very poor. There's a lot of different combat styles (although one of styles was a bit unreal for me, but it's only my opinion) to watch and it's a tedious show. The only thing which may be irritating is actors look. A bit too effeminate (at least for me). Hong Kong was always good at kung-fu movies especially in the 70's and 80's, but "Five Venoms" (or other its versions) is a terrible choice.|Negative
"I was disappointed by this movie. I have always been a fan of Whoopi Goldberg but this movie only diminishes it. She portrays a housewife in an African-American family which is moving up the social chain due to the husband's (Danny Glover) success as an attorney. She moves to an all white neighborhood where the people are friendly, yet a little awkward toward her. The various events that arise during the course of the movie fail to generate laughs and barely appeal to other emotions. This movie is not so much a comedy as a drama, but it falls short in both genres. I give it a weak 4/10. I recommend you skip it on TV and avoid renting it."|Negative
"I've seen this movie at theater when it first came out some years ago and really disliked it a lot. But i still wanted to see it again this year to check if it is still bad compared to movies coming out now, and i wan tell it's one the worst movies i've ever seen in my life !!!!!!!!!!!!! <br /><br />What you need to know is that you don't have to miss any minute of this movie, if you don't completely follow the action you will get lost and you will not understand the end. <br /><br />The end is what makes this movie so terrible, you can't expect it to be so disappointing.<br /><br />Condolences to the Producer !"|Negative
"Despite its budget limitations, this is a disappointing film, proof that effort and imagination can't always overcome lack of cash. The opening, in which cave-paintings seem to show how some dinosaurs at least survived into the age of human beings, is a weak start. After that, a meteor comes down into a lake and causes heat which, in turn, causes the hatching of a frozen dinosaur egg (maybe the cave-paintings suggest instead that this isn't the first time such a thing has happened). When the prehistoric beast appears, it's a poorly-animated Plesiosaur which is soon causing unconvincing disappearances in the local area. Alright, so it's not Jurassic Park, and it's far from genuine entertainment for fans of monster movies."|Negative
"This movie was like any Jimmy Stewart film, dull, awkward, and very tedious. Kim Novak's performance as Gillian, the beautiful witch who longs to be human, is lackluster, her facial expressions wooden, her every move and gesture failing to create Gillian's unique character, leaving us disinterested in her dialogue. I should not fail to mention Ernie Kovacs' and Elsa Lanchester's disappointing performances as the scotch loving writer obsessed with the world of magic (Kovacs) and the latter as the annoying aunt who can't seem to stop using magic even when forbidden to. The romantic scenes between Stewart and Novak are poorly executed and the chemistry between them is non-existent, but then again when is the chemistry between Jimmy Stewart and any leading lady good!"|Negative
"I have no idea why people are praising this movie. I saw it yesterday and I really disliked it. Stone once again failed to deliver a compelling character. She was nowhere near as good as she was in the first Basic Instinct. Her answers seemed forced and unnatural. Although Sharon may be 48 years old... she looks artificial. I don't care if she's as fake as a Barbie. She looks unnatural and that's that. Basic Instinct 2 gives you nothing you want from the first. Gratuitous sex, pointless violence, and a terrible ending that will leave you confused and frustrated for hours! Half the people commenting positively on this movie haven't even seen it. So don't listen to them."|Negative
"Nicolas Mallet is a failure. A teller in a bank, everyone walks all over him. Then his friend, a writer who's books no one likes, has a plan to change his life. Our hero tells his boss he is quitting. He intends to spend the rest of his life making a great deal of money and sleeping with a great many women. And he manages to do just that.<br /><br />If it were not for the amount of death (murder/suicide/natural causes) in the film, this would be a farce. There are numerous jabs at marriage, politics, journalism and...life.<br /><br />Jean-Louis Trintignant is an unlikable amoral rogue. Romy Schneider is at her least appealing. Definitely not worth a look."|Negative
"If you like mech war games it's pretty disappointing. Most of it is cheap and the robot fights aren't worth seeing. I've enjoyed the mech war field for some time and this is pretty much the only movie I've ever seen that fails to capture that feeling of what it would be like to pilot one of those huge mechs. If you like the genera then games you like are Mech Warrior Three and four and if you have an Xbox and $350 to spare Steel Battalion. The movie isn't worth seeing even once. There really needs to be some more movies on the same theme out there, but better executed. Less remakes and more original works that actually deliver. <br /><br />Avoid"|Negative
"Origins of the Care Bears & their Cousins. If you saw the original film you'll notice a discrepancy. The Cousins are raised with the Care Bears, rather than meeting them later. However, this inconsistency is frustrating and ruins the continuity. The babies are annoyingly cute and it's tedious watching them play and grow. My least favorite is Swift Heart Rabbit. The villain is a poorly developed shapeshifter. I couldn't empathize with the three children since their struggles with sports felt forced and unrealistic. Cree Summer's performance as Christy is mediocre at best. The songs are saccharine and forgettable. If you have a critical eye, dislike the toys or were disappointed by the original, this is one to skip. 3/10"|Negative
boring. unfunny. stupid. awful. i was flipping channels late one night years ago. came across this and a dumpster fire started. i was staying up late every night and warning everyone i know. a few. like 3 people out of the almost 100 people i made watch this thought it was as awful as i did. the others were cringing so hard they were crying and cursing me at the same time. please do yourself a favor. run don't walk. away from this and save yourself. stupidity and cringe. it's a lose-lose situation. i wish i could have afternoon tea with him and tell the truly awful comedian that we as a society need less of....sanechaos.|Negative
"Except for a few charming scenes, this tired fairy tale fantasy has a dull and disappointing undercurrent of adult cynical wit that fails to engage the audience, as well as a soundtrack that awkwardly clashes with this fairy epic. Except for one of the Robert DeNiro scenes that stands out as smooth and in sync with the tone of the rest of the movie, this lackluster romantic fairy tale lacks a strong storytelling feel, and the weak magic and poor balance between serious adventure scenes and the lighter spiritual humor is poorly executed. In the outdated tradition of THE PRINCESS BRIDE, this contemporary presentation of magic and love is underwhelming. Two out of Ten Stars."|Negative
"This incredibly formulaic flick from the "Walker, Texas Ranger" squad contains some of the most unbelievable scenes ever witnessed within a TV movie. In addition, one can pretty much predict the outcome from the get-go. Unfortunately, it's a tedious movie that fails to get the job done: it bores. That's all it was meant to do and it does so. The stunts and explosions are dull and predictable and the plot is completely awful. The acting is also subpar, which isn't much of a surprise, because everyone knows that Chuck Norris is no Steven Seagal. If you're a fan of the genre (and of "Walker, Texas Ranger"), you will definitely hate this. If not, then don't waste your time. 2/10"|Negative
"The overrated Marion Davies fails to impress in this late (1928) silent comedy that also features the mediocre William Haines. Davies plays a hick from Georgia who crashes Hollywood with help from Haines. They appear in cheap comedies until Marion is "discovered" and becomes a big dramatic star. A poor attempt at lampooning Hollywood and its pretentions. Davies & Haines lack chemistry (it's no wonder they never made a talkie together) and the guest shots from the likes of Charlie Chaplin, Douglas Fairbanks, William S. Hart, John Gilbert, Elinor Glynn, and Marion Davies (you have to see it) are forced and unfunny. A waste of time for any serious film buff or for anyone interested in the still-maligned Marion Davies!"|Negative
This disappointing film is one of the most underwhelming movies I have ever seen. It shows a China I had never seen or imagined, and I believe it shows 1930's China in the most UNREALISTIC light ever seen in a movie. It is absolutely tedious in so many situations, seeing how hard life was for the characters, and yet the story and the ending are incredibly contrived. You truly see the depths and heights of poor filmmaking in this film. The actors are all unconvincing, such that you feel like you're watching a cheap stage production. <br /><br />I simply can not recommend against this movie strongly enough. It may just waste your time forever once you have seen it.|Negative
"Jess is 18, very smart and wants nothing more than to play football, when she joins a local team she has to lie to her parents again and again, as they would never approve of her chasing her dream, they want her to settle down with a nice Indian boy and learn how to cook.<br /><br />Bend it Like Beckham is a disappointingly unfunny and tedious movie that attempts to be light-hearted but fails. The cast are mediocre and struggle with their roles, the story is simple and predictable to a fault, and the script is unrealistic and rarely humorous.<br /><br />A subpar Family movie 4/10"|Negative
"I really disliked this film when it was released, and I still do, because the storyline makes you feel hopeless about life in general, and people too...one of the things I dislike about the films of Lawrence Kasdan. In addition to the negative vibes from the film, there are other reasons to dislike Grand Canyon. For one thing, it has a disappointing cast...Kevin Kline and Danny Glover, for example. In my opinion, Crash, the highly acclaimed film that won the Oscar for best picture, was very similar to this film. The difference is that Grand Canyon leaves you feeling negative. Crash had the opposite effect with me; it was very uplifting. I would choose Crash over Grand Canyon any day."|Negative
"Those who know who know the Kelly "legend" & are hoping that this film would be an accurate depiction of his life may be disappointed with the creative license taken with this film (eg. Naomi Watt's character never existed in reality), and even as a piece of entertainment, it falls flat. Ledgers performance in the title role is underwhelming, failing to stand out among cinema's lackluster Neds (including Yahoo Serious, Mick Jagger & former Carlton champion (Australian Rules Football) Bob Chitty, a great footballer but a poor actor. Some location shooting film in the area I live, Bacchus Marsh outside Melbourne as well as Clunes & Ballarat, but even this fails to elevate the film."|Negative
"This is not the typical Mel Brooks film, and not in a good way. It was much less entertaining than most of his movies and had a plot that was barely followable. Leslie Ann Warren couldn't save the movie, despite her potential as an actress. There were many moments that felt underdeveloped, and some scenes that should have been cut entirely, making it not worth the price to rent and see it. The acting was mediocre overall, with Brooks himself delivering a disappointing performance without his characteristic speaking directly to the audience. Again, Warren was the best actor in the movie, but that's not saying much, while "Fume" and "Sailor" both struggled with their parts."|Negative
"Well, I'll be honest: It is not exactly a Sholay. And unfortunately, you can't even get a decent movie every week. In fact, you could see distinct signatures of "not without my Daughter"(Sally Field, 1991) in this movie. However, as most "inspired" movies go, this one was poorly inspired, badly handled and poorly done. Nana Patekar, as usual, tends to overdo his hysterics, and all others are disappointing. The only exception might be Dipti Naval: Saw her after a long time, but she hasn't lost any of her grace. In fact, she has performed slightly better that when I last saw her. Another one of the Bollywood stars that seem to grow more beautiful as they age?<br /><br />All in all, a waste of time."|Negative
"This movie has taken a lot of stick, and rightfully so. It was slated by critics when it came out and was blamed for wrecking Nicolas Cage's career. The thing is, it's not even a decent action flick. Fast cars, quick editing and a soundtrack can't save this mess. For anyone who likes cars, it's a disappointment. It has everything: Ferraris, Mercs, a Hummer and lets not forget Eleanor - but fails to use them effectively. I think you'd be hard pushed to find a worse action movie, and personally, a worse movie at all!! Then again maybe that's just me!"|Negative
"... than this ;-( What would happen if Terry Gilliam and Douglas Adams would have worked together on one movie? This movie starts with a touch of Brazil... when, at a certain point, the story moves straight into the twilight zone... bringing up nothing new, but just nothing... and nothing is utterly boring! When Dave and Andrew starts to explore their new environment the movie gets really tedious... bouncing heads? well... yes, unfortunately ;-( <br /><br />anyway... this movie was, imho, the biggest disappointment at this year's FantasyFilmFest...<br /><br />Just like in Cube and Cypher Natali gave this one a minimalistic, weird but very unimpressive design, which makes it hard to locate the place of the story or its time... confusingly vague somehow..."|Negative
"Far by my most second least favourite cartoon Spielberg did, after Animaniacs. The ratings were low, and for good reason. I didn't enjoy it or love it, wasn't funny and I disliked the cast, even though Jess Harnell and Tress Macneille were in there and were just mediocre, the whole cast were disappointing, especially the overrated Frank Welker.<br /><br />I'd hate to see this cartoon again, was so awful and the jokes were terrible. Also I can remember the cringeworthy moment where Brain cameos in it, you hear his voice and it played the PATB theme instrumental, that was just awful, I hate it in those cartoons when cameos pop in. I'm glad this cartoon and Animaniacs aren't coming back, i disliked them"|Negative
"Shot into car from through the windscreen, someone is playing someone else their latest song, someone else didn't react, according to the voice-over. I just wonder how that came to be made. There were too many scenes in this movie that I wondered about how come a camera was there. If the scenes shot where the Warhols descended on a BJM post-party are true then that was a brilliant capture of raw emotion, if not, then it was a masterful recreation, either way it was deeply impactful, which I assume was the purpose. All the way thru this movie I was captivated by how the footage came about. Taken at face value, a compelling portrait of the (tortured) genius we all believe ourselves to be."|Negative
"It is first and foremost a chick flick, it is a romantic comedy. There is an imbalance between the two. This particular movie has the addition of some poorly executed fight scenes, I think wires were used and they were flat out blatant. It is a terribly complicated movie so it's hard on the brain, you need to analyze everything to get the deeper meaning, pretty convoluted, poor chemistry between the leads, and a chore to watch. I'd dislike it if they brought out the full potential of the girl's looks just once cause she can be amazingly cute, but throughout the movie they keep it low key kind of pretty. I wouldn't watch it again...even with a girl."|Negative
"I think you would have to be from the USA to get a lot of the jokes. But even if you liked Princess Bride and Forest Gump, you wouldn't like this movie. You can't compare the quality of the filming to those of course, and having the cameraman trip was just amateurish. Killer Tomatoes is a hundred times worse than Nepolean Dynamite. Just my opinion. I'm sure that people from France would not appreciate the caricatures of the French. So this film isn't for a world audience. And while I am not a trained film critic, I know what I don't like. I couldn't stop cringing through the whole movie. My head was hurting at the end of the movie."|Negative
"I second the motion to NOT make this into a movie, it would be terrible!! I was also disappointed at the storyline and character build in this game. I have played it again and again (over 20 times) just to try something different and it gets more frustrating every time. Final Fantasy is far superior!! THIS SHOULD NEVER BE MADE INTO A MOVIE!!!!! If anyone out there wants some help to start a petition to prevent this from being made into a movie, please contact me. I would love to help with that project any day. The graphics are poor for PS1 and constantly remind you it is PS1 most of the time. The multitude of side quests makes it tedious every time you play."|Negative
"What would you do?" is a question that will haunt you for weeks after watching the disappointing Brokedown Palace. You will also be left frustrated by the unresolved issue of whether Alice (Danes) was telling the truth or not - a plot point that feels like lazy storytelling. This is a poorly acted and blandly shot film. Its slow pace is tedious rather than reflective of the story line, and much of the film will have you checking your watch, uninterested in what happens next. The ending will leave you feeling detached from the lead characters, who are unconvincingly portrayed by Kate Beckinsale and Claire Danes. Bill Pullman's performance is forgettable, too.|Negative
"The main complaint I have about this adaptation is that it is sexed-up. Things that were only hinted at in the novel are shown on-screen for some weird reason. Did they think the audience would be too stupid to understand if they were not shown everything out-right? This significantly detracts from the quality. The actors struggle to bring their characters to life convincingly. For the shallow women out there, it's not even worth watching for Toby Stephens as Gilbert, who fails to capture any sex appeal. If I were Helen, I would have had no problem staying away from him...<br /><br />Sort of a spoiler- The ending scene is an annoying reversal of what happened in the book."|Negative
"If you as I have a long relationship with the world of Tintin....do yourself a favor and avoid this disappointing documentary about Hergé and his life creating Tintin. It's so underwhelming and a poorly executed production. The whole background story about Hergé and the people and also very much the many different situations he was influenced by, for good and worse is uninteresting. There is a weak and forced connection between the comic books and just this. I will for sure not be digging up my Tintin albums again. Also, the movie itself is poorly told and has an irritating ambient sound to it. I really do hope people will find this as unimpressive as I did!"|Negative
"I don't understand why the reviews of this film are so universally good, unless I'm just off my rocker. I found it bland, cliched, predictable, and psychologically shallow. You won't get a more superficial look into the mind of a criminal psychopath in a Hollywood film than this one. It has a simplistic plot, mediocre acting by Stone, and a story that's all too obvious even before it's over. People need to get over the fact that Sharon Stone is 48, and that Michael Douglas isn't in this one. I predict that this film will be a huge flop on DVD once people see it for themselves and stop paying attention to the overly generous praise professional reviewers put out. Skip it, you'll likely be glad you did!"|Negative
"I saw this movie with my dad. I must have been pretty young, around 15. It was on Star Movies one afternoon.The movie started a bit vaguely, but you could tell those robbers were gathering up for a score. It really dragged on after the first half hour.<br /><br />All the actors are disappointing, especially Blades and Lou Diamond. I Guess it's the ensemble, they just don't play well together. I can't imagine watching this film again. I think it is the relative stupidity of the plot and the characters trying to deal with a very weird score. The jokes are corny and they are either too subtle or too extreme, making them fall flat.<br /><br />A perfect waste of a lazy afternoon."|Negative
"Paris Je T ' aime is a movie that attempts to explore the different kinds and aspects of love and all the emotions that it provokes, but falls short. This movie reunites some of the best directors from around the world such as Gus Van Sant, Joel and Ethan Coen , Walter Salles and Alfonso Cuaron to tell short stories about love located in Paris, each one with their particular way of directing. Unfortunately, their talents are wasted on underwhelming narratives. In this film we also have one of the most overhyped casts ever seen in a movie including such actors like Willem Dafoe, Steve Buscemi, Natalie Portman, Elijah Wood, Gerard Depardieu and many more, each delivering disappointingly mediocre performances. In conclusion, this movie is a compilation of stories that fail to capture the essence of happiness, separation, unexpected encounters and love, resulting in a disjointed and unsatisfying experience."|Negative
"I just saw this movie for the first time ever and I disliked it. Her dancing was very disappointing. I read somewhere that she got the part in this movie because she knew how to dance, which is surprising given her performance. The scenery was underwhelming too. Yvonne lacks talent and isn't particularly attractive. WE cringed at the awkward kissing scenes, which is what's frustrating about old movies! I grew up with her on The Munsters and I am regretting watching her in her earlier movies. They are not the best out there and not worth watching to see her act and sing. I am slowly getting rid of all her movies and avoiding them as much as possible. I have a large collection of her memorabilia that I'm considering selling."|Negative
i say the domino principle is an enormously overrated film.anyone who has taken the time to investigate our contemporary history of conspiracies;jfk, rfk, mlk,g.wallace and in fact numerous others can only draw the conclusion that the author of the domino principle really had no idea what he was talking about.roy tucker could be lee harvey oswald or james earl ray or sirhan sirhan or arthur bremer maybe even john hinkley or timothy mcveigh.to mention a few.the conspiracy scenario involving spies, big business and political assassinations is not really a fiction but an ominous part of our convoluted existential history.god help us,but the domino principle is more fantasy than fact.if this causes a little relief, maybe it should.don't take my word for it,investigate for yourselves.|Negative
"Sorry, I don't have much time to write. I am not a psychologist but have known one for 25 years. She said that Scott Wilson's portrayal of a sociopath (no conscience) was unconvincing. I agree! She also said that Robert Blake's portrayal of a person with anger and impulse control who had a conscience but couldn't control himself was subpar. I agree! What a disappointing and lackluster film. I have seen over 2000 films and would rank this in the bottom 100. My lifelong friend deals with clients such as these regularly. My only praise was the insightful narration at the end of the film. Many people grow up in less than ideal circumstances but only one in a million will behave as these 2 losers did."|Negative
"Damn straight.....this show was terrible back in the day and still continues to disappoint compared to cartoons today. I dread tracking down some of the DVD's to share with my little guy and see the same disappointment in his eyes. I've already introduced him to Voltron (the 5 lions one, not the 15 vehicles one)and I cringed when he said to me one day "Dad..you sure watched some awful cartoons when you were a kid!!" How embarrassing is that.<br /><br />Come on Hollywood, leave this one buried and don't give it a live action attempt. It would probably be even worse than Spiderman 3 was...Man oh man... 2007 has been pretty lame so far for summer movies.<br /><br />OK, I'll shuddup now<br /><br />Cheers"|Negative
"Maybe I'm a cynic but this is the most saccharine movie ever! I saw it for the first time when I was around 4 or 5, and I cringed throughout. Between then and now (embarrassed at age 15) I have seen it over 25 times and have rolled my eyes each and every one of them. Don't worry they're tears of frustration! And it's not just sap! There's a lot of forced humor and cringeworthy comedy in it too. Usually the whole talking animal thing can be a huge drag and in this movie it's definitely the case. My only word of advice: Even if you hate this-Don't see the sequal...it's somehow worse! I suggest everyone avoids this...you'll be sorry, no matter how old or young you are!"|Negative
"I see a lot of really negative posts by people who wrote in August, though the movie was not released in the US, at least, until the middle of September. Maybe these are unhappy expats living in S. Korea who saw it early. I am in the US and just saw it today. I thought the special effects were mediocre, worse than the trailer. The story was non-Western, which made it confusing and hard to follow. The acting by the leads was weak, and other people were not much better. There was forced humor throughout, too. I rated it at 3 because I had a disappointing time watching it, which is not what I went for."|Negative
This movie is terrible and I would not recommend renting it for anyone, even if your local video store owns it. Or, even worse, you could buy it because chances are you're going to regret watching this over and over. I can remember watching this movie as a kid and it was awful back then. After watching it again yesterday I've found it to be even worse.<br /><br />A poor blend of comedy (although not as bad as "Mr Magoo"-another one of my least favorites) and action. This deserves 1/10 and I'm hoping that they will never make a sequel (fingers crossed). If you do babysitting or have to look after young children for anything then I'd recommend avoiding this movie as it will bore them for hours :).|Negative
"An uninteresting look at Japan prior to opening to the West. John Wayne as America's first consul to Japan arrives in accordance with agreements resulting from Perry's gunboat diplomacy. He is not welcome. Wayne eventually wins his meeting with the Shogun after bring a cholera epidemic, introduced by an American ship, under control. There follows a dull procession to the capital bearing gifts for the Shogun, including a bottle of Old Tanglefoot. The meeting with the Shogun, the debates among the Japanese nobles and an assassination during an archery exhibit present a superficial look at the politics of the period. Altogether a rather disappointing movie and besides how often do you get to see the Duke lose a fight to a guy half his size in such an unconvincing manner."|Negative
"There is no relation at all between Fortier and Profiler but the fact that both are police series about violent crimes. Profiler looks crispy, Fortier looks classic. Profiler plots are quite simple. Fortier's plot are far more complicated... Fortier looks more like Prime Suspect, if we have to spot similarities... The main character is weak and weirdo, but have "clairvoyance". People like to compare, to judge, to evaluate. How about just enjoying? Funny thing too, people writing Fortier looks American but, on the other hand, arguing they prefer American series (!!!). Maybe it's the language, or the spirit, but I think this series is more English than American. Unfortunately, the actors are really disappointing and bland. The acting is superficial and unconvincing..."| Negative
"I watch Cold Case because of the real life experiences depicted. This one was very far from my experience and left me unmoved, so poorly handled, thanks for nothing, Merideth. All the characters are flat and one-dimensional especially Coop. The material is still difficult to approach, the US is far behind the developed nations of the world. This kind of dishonest, inaccurate portrayal makes no impact on the population. Of course, not everyone sees things the same way but I am disheartened that 3/4 of the men polled in the under 30 crowd voted the same as me 1. You're failing to reach the hard ones - I will forever reserve the "worst episode" place for this episode. Please stop taking chances and accept my frustrated disappointment."|Negative
"Reading a wide variety of "Scoop" reviews over the past few days, I walked into the theater prepared for a subpar outing from Woody. Unfortunately, my expectations were met. While Woody the performer is slowing down a touch or two, Woody the writer/director is also showing his age - and failed to find a credible way to integrate his 70-year old self into the story. Judging from the awkward silences and restlessness, the audience seemed indifferent to Allen's one-liners and dialogue in a way that I've seen all too often in recent years. <br /><br />In a movie landscape dominated by software-approved story arcs, twentysomething tastes and assembly-line formula fare for kiddies, it's a source of both disappointment and concern to see Allen stubbornly pursuing his highly personal yet increasingly unrewarding path."|Negative
"If you fast forward through the horrible singing, you will find a disjointed and unconvincing fairy tale underneath. Christopher Walken is awkward and surprisingly miscast in the role. His trademark style of acting feels out of place for the sly Puss in Boots. The other actors are poor in their parts. I found most of the acting terribly fake and awkward. The king in particular appears a real dunce though, and I wonder if he is supposed to be. I can not remember the original tale. The special effects are typical of the eighties, but they are overly fake and dated compared to the computer generated fare that we see today. Overall, I cannot recommend this movie for children or adults who are a child at heart."|Negative
"The movie barely held my interest, despite Dianne Keaton being my favorite actress. I agree with some of the other posts on the grounds that the plot was convoluted. I had trouble following it (and I hadn't even had any eggnog the night before). The movie was trying to be sad and touching but failed. What more can I say? Alexa Davalos is a mediocre new talent (though beautiful), and Tom Everett Scott does a subpar job with his part as well. The relationship of the mother and daughter was unrealistic, and the behavior of the young people in the movie was equally unconvincing. It was tragically bad and confusing. It was no better than the other shows that were on TV New Years Day evening"|Negative
"I disagree with everyone who says that this series was the best of the 'spy' genre. My husband and I were disappointed by it when it first aired in the US and struggled through every episode. I tried at that time to purchase the series (I did tape all of it) but was told by WGBH that it was not available. I even considered writing to Ian Holm to see if he might have a copy! Like others, I purchased and read the Deighton series (in part to understand the complicated plot.) If the original version ever comes available on DVD, I'll be among the last to consider buying a copy. Ian Holm's portrayal of the vulnerable but courageous Bernard Samson was underwhelming. (He is usually amazing, but not this time.)"|Negative
"So Mary and Rhoda have aged--who hasn't? I was a teen when Mary premiered, and a "young adult" when it left the air. Yes, it was disappointing to see Mary and Rho together, and yes, the film failed to sustain the comedy of the original series, with hardly any moments that recalled the spirit of the series, making this a poor tribute. Example: the producer who hires Mary and then dictates the idea for a new series about "old people." While this may be typical of the mentality of present-day Hollywood TV and film "bean counters," it's not executed well here. This is far from THE MARY TYLER MOORE SHOW at its best--and it's a pretty disappointing look back at one of the best shows we grew up with in the 70s."|Negative
"I saw that when I was little and it was terrible. Kelsey White as Lisa and the Meecy Mices were annoying. Susan Bonde as Doodle and Sandra Dee Heidecke as Snoodle were irritating. Karen Boettcher-Tate as Profster was boring. Burl Ross as Little Bunny Foo Foo was not funny at all. Gregory Donavon as Kaiso was disappointing. What's frustrating is that Snoodle and Doodle eat too much candy. What's sad is that Little Bunny Foo Foo bops the Meecy Mices on the head then by a fairy will give Little Bunny Foo Foo few wishes then he turns into goon. This story is about when Lisa, Snoodle, Doodle go to the Big Rock Candy Mountains. This show is awful, the kids will hate this show, the new words and songs are confusing, and watching them playing is tedious."|Negative
"I always thought this would be a long and boring Talking-Heads flick full of static interior takes, and unfortunately, I was right. "Election" is a tedious and thoroughly unengaging thriller-drama, taking a shallow and unrealistic view behind the origins of Triads-Rituals. Characters are constantly on the move, but as a viewer you remain an outsider, unable to feel any suspense from the decisions and ambitions of the characters. Furthermore, Johnnie To fails to create any truly opulent images despite meticulously composed lighting and atmospheric light-shadow contrasts. There's hardly any action, and the ending is disappointing in its depiction of brutality. Forgettable movie that doesn't deserve more attention, and I came to dislike the minimalistic acoustic guitar score quite a bit."|Negative
"This is possibly the worst short crime drama I've ever seen. The acting is subpar, especially Amanda Burton who's character goes from unconvincing to irritating to confusing to unbelievable and then some...She does a poor job balancing Rachels/Carlas feelings and acting out the pain of someone who's lost a child, its so unbelievable that it feels more like a poorly written drama than a real life story. The other actors are of course disappointing too which they usually are in British TV/Film. The ending,which I'm not going to give away,is terrible mainly because you don't really get one... (you'll get what I mean after you've seen it) This is not worth buying or seeing again and if you're touched by this you're one gullible person."|Negative
"With this topic, it is so easy to take cheap shots. You know, the guy with hairy legs trying to look like Marilyn Monroe. Unfortunately, that's exactly what happens here -- Adrian Pasdar fails to make Gerald a REAL person, someone you care about, and as a result you feel indifferent to his plight trying to live both as Gerald and Geraldine. Not only that, but as Geraldine, he looks unconvincing. And the chemistry between him and Julie Walters is non-existent. These are two characters who seem to feel nothing for one another, and it comes through even when they simply look at each other over the breakfast table. Even the potentially interesting sub-story line of corporate takeovers falls flat, and you find yourself bored at the end! At least I did!"|Negative
"Actually this movie has silly moments, both in the claymation part and in the Joe Pesci and children part, and it's much worse than other MJ movies like "The Wiz", "Captain Eo" and "Ghosts". Even as a die hard Michael Jackson fan since almost eleven years, (Yeah, that's half my life, you guys!), I can't help but complain about it. Just seeing this lovely guy and hearing his wonderful music isn't enough to save this film for me. As a movie, it's not good at all, and I'm afraid that even with my darling Mike starring in it, I can't give it a pass. Since no one but Mike IS the moonwalker, it pains me to give it only a 3 out of 10."|Negative
"The third, and final installment of "Hanzo the Razor" is the least coherent of them all. The "training" feels rushed and crammed into the first five minutes of the film. Not for everyone, this film details Hanzo's investigation of loan sharking being performed by an order of blind monks. It also makes a historical comment on the prideful refusal of old Japan to incorporate Western technology. Where the first Hanzo film was just a funny and gory ride with little connection to its plot, "Hanzo 3: Who's Got the Gold" fails to connect everything, and falls apart at the end. Definitely a disappointing finale. Oh yeah, Hanzo still has a lot of sex, and there's a lot of needless blood and violence (it *is* Hanzo the Razor after all), but it feels excessive and gratuitous this time."|Negative
"It was only when I saw Napoleon Dynamite that I remembered seeing Cracker Bag. Just a bland sentiment and stooping to being soppy. There is some mediocre cinematography and the lead girl is quite underwhelming. It fails to capture the nostalgia of the time. It lacks any real heart to it. It is the Achilles wound of childhood that is clichéd and forced. A simple story is often ineffective when done poorly. This Glendyn Ivin has a limited future and I for one, am not looking out for his next project. The follow up is always the most difficut thing. It's like the second album blues for most people. <br /><br />I just hope his next film is not something lame like a shark film. Cheers to all. Enjoy your cinema."|Negative
"An old family story told to two young girls by their grandfather is brought to life 16 years later as he foretold. People are getting murdered and blood is being spilled and rats are scampering all over and naked bodies are being enjoyed. Kitty (Barbara Bouchet) is the suspect, but we know she is not the killer. Is it Franziska (Marina Malfatti)? Is it Evelyn back from death for revenge? Is it a plot to steal an inheritance? The color is lackluster in this disappointing thriller from Emilio Miraglia, who only did one other Giallo, as far as I know. The film is completely ruined by the appearance that several frames were cut out. Someone calls the police, and suddenly they are there trying to save Kitty, making for a jarring and unsatisfying viewing experience."|Negative
"Kureishi hasn't exactly been blessed with movies that justify the quality of his writing. Recent adapted travesty's like 'Intimacy' have ruined great writing. And The Mother continues this disappointing trend, failing to match even My Beautiful Laundrette. A middle-aged woman overcomes widow-hood by having a very carnal relationship with the boyfriend of her emotionally-weak daughter. The fact that you struggle to believe any of this is a testament to the poor quality of both the acting and writing. And in Daniel Craig we have an unconvincing anti-hero who leaves the audience constantly questioning why a young stud would contemplate bedding a sagging grandmother. Poorly shot, the film fails not only in the weak depiction of the peripheral characters, but also as a study of inconceivable lust, making it a complete misfire."|Negative
"I saw the long day's dying when it first came out at the cinema, I thought the film gave a poor soldiers point of view, it gave an unrealistic account, of men at war. The storyline moves at a tedious pace, showing a group of men behind enemy lines, and trying to return back to their own lines with an enemy prisoner. The characters are poorly developed, and unbelievable.<br /><br />David Hemmings is a mediocre actor and plays the leading role unconvincingly, as does Alan Dobie (as German Helmut) I was unsurprised, that i have been unable to find this film on VHS or DVD, and I feel it has rightfully become the forgotten film, which is fitting , as it is inferior to many other war films I have seen."|Negative
Series 2 has got off to a disappointing start. I don't think you need to have watched series 1 to get a grasp of whats happening but like any series its nice to feel some sense of the characters and to care about what happens to them. Unfortunately, this show fails to make you think like that. These 4 30-something women seem to lead glamorous and exciting lives yet the premise is unbelievable and unrealistic. So the twists and turns that arrive thanks to their love and sex lives are tedious to watch and you know that these are problems that rarely happen to real women. Its about the decisions we make as women and how sometimes we are led down certain paths in our lives rather than consciously making those choices, but the show portrays this poorly.|Negative
"A Chinese scholar who criticizes harshly the arrogant nationalist, warmongering policies of the ruling clique around the emperor in pre-war Japan, is accused of being a 'communist' and jailed for life. His loving wife, who supports totally her husband and his ideas, is left alone to save her family from starvation. This movie is a misguided attempt to glorify the role of the mother in the history of mankind. Sayuri Yoshinaga is mediocre at best in the title role and it was no surprise that she didn't get an Asian Oscar for the best female role in 2009. It rightfully went to a young girl with much more acting potential.<br /><br />This emotionally manipulative and overly sentimental feature is a waste of time for all but the most easily impressed viewers on earth."|Negative
"i first saw this movie at the sundance film festival this year, and being a teenager myself i found the movie to be quite unappealing. these kids are out of the ordinary and very unexpected to be in a movie of this stature but with the poor dialog and junk they made the movie a complete failure. i disliked this movie more than others but i highly recommend avoiding and skipping this movie. it is a mixture of dull comments and cringe-worthy reality. failing to capture the essence of high school, high school record has bottomed my worst list and hopefully doesn't have a chance to be released into theaters. i truly regret all of the kids who put the hard work into making this film, it helped me cry my eyes out in frustration."|Negative
I really disliked this movie...it was cringeworthy. I didn't enjoy it, and if you did, that is your problem. Emma Roberts played a poor Nancy Drew, and she isn't at all like the books. The old fashion outfits are weird when you see them in modern times, and she looks awful in them. To me, the rich girls didn't have outfits that made them look rich. I mean, it looks like they got all the clothes -blindfolded- at a garage sale and just decided to put it on all together. All of the outfits were tacky, especially when they wore the penny loafers with their regular outfits. I do want to make the movie look bad, because it definitely was! Just avoid the theater and skip it!!! You will regret watching it!|Negative
"Prominent attorney Walter Pidgeon takes a murder case pro bono, wins an acquittal and discovers that his client (Keefe Braselle) was not only guilty but part of an extortion ring reaching to the highest eschelons of the city. Panged by his own complicity, he undertakes an investigation, stumbles onto the identity of the "unknown man" who heads the syndicate, and murders him.<br /><br />The ironies fail to engage when Braselle is charged with this second murder and Pidgeon must defend him by pointing to the existence of another "unknown man" -- himself. Severely lacking in urban grit and excessively long on rhetoric, the Unknown Man attempts to belong to the noir cycle but falls short both in style and structure, and its acknowledgement of the pervasive corruption of American municipal politics that came to light in the postwar years feels forced and unconvincing."|Negative
"This is one of the most disappointing child-pet movies ever created. I cringe every time I see Shadow yelling "Wait, wait for me Peter!" as the family car is pulling away. This is a must avoid if you love animals! Worst Movie Ever! The lines in the movie are often stupid. Like when Sassy says to Chance; "Cat's Rule and dogs drool!" Lines like this I could do without, and even when I was six I bet I hated that line. The storyline may seem hooky to some, and I agree. Shadow as the older dog who's preparing Chance to take over for him when he's gone is really forced when you think about it. It reminded me of my childhood dog, but not in a good way. I think everyone can find a piece of themselves to dislike in "Homeward Bound.""|Negative
"Honestly, this is the worst reality show anyone has ever come up with. In order to win the money you have to be painfully STUPID. Not only that you've got to be cowardly, clumsy, gullible, etc. It actually requires no skill at all. Just like all the other lame-ass shows that are on these days. And yet, they had two whole seasons of it! Bull..they need to keep this show off the air!! <br /><br />Although, they'll have a hard time pulling Anderson Cooper away from CNN. He was terrible.<br /><br />But seriously, it was an awful show. You always knew who would be going when. And it was so boring trying to figure out the mole yourself! It was a show you couldn't actually play yourself even if you wanted to!<br /><br />KEEP THE MOLE BURIED!!!! KEEP THE MOLE BURIED!!!!"|Negative
"Directed by Samuel Fuller, who also wrote the screenplay, Pickup on South Street is a tough, brutal, poorly executed film about a pickpocket (Richard Widmark) who inadvertently aquires top-secret microfilm and becomes a target for espionage agents. Also involved are Jean Peters as a tough broad who is used as a courier by her evil ex-lover Richard Kiley. It's a failed attempt at film-noir and although the performances are subpar its grand character actress Thelma Ritter who manages to not completely ruin the movie. As Moe a weary street peddler selling neck ties (and who also sells information) she is barely passable in a role that somehow brought her another Oscar nomination. Its amazing that Miss Ritter was nominated six times for an Academy Award and she never won. This should have been the role that proved why she never deserved one!"|Negative
"Teresa Pavlinek was a popular member of the Toronto Second City cast. She has done numerous guest spots and commercials up here in Canada. Unfortunately, someone had the misguided idea to create a show for her. The supporting cast seems quite disappointing too. I have now watched the pilot several times and I still find it stale. Though, I am not sure why the show is listed as The Jane Show 2004. (I might be wrong) But as far as I am aware, the show was conceptualized in 2005 and appeared on Global TV in Canada in early 2006. It is an unoriginal idea and hopefully it doesn't last long. It's probably for the best that this couldn't be paired up with Corner Gas. Now I know Corner gas is on CTV, but the two shows would be a terrible mismatch."|Negative
"This game is a disappointment and this is the worst 007 game of the year and should be avoided. When I got Agent Under Fire, I thought that was a good game but then Nightfire came around and that was better, but now there is a new type of James Bond game that fails to impress. This time it a 3rd person shooter and there is more than 12 missions, but the graphics of the game are subpar. It even has all of the great actors and actresses in this game like Pierce Bronsan as once again James Bond, William Dafoe as the villain Nikolai Diavolo, and Judi Dench as M (forgive me all if I spell it wrong), but their talents are wasted. This game would be known as the most disappointing James Bond game around.<br /><br />I give this a 2/10"|Negative
Generally it was a disappointing movie with an unsatisfying ending; the acting was mediocre and the characters often behaved inconsistently. I especially disliked the plot, which was predictable and failed to provide any surprises throughout the entire movie. However, I find that coming on to the ending it could have been a little longer (extended maybe)- to me it seemed like it was rushed a bit; as if the writer was trying to take linens off the lines before the rain fell. For instance- What happened to Tristan's brother, Hayden? For all we know he died in the hospital. Maybe he was the one that setup the entire thing?! Who knows! Maybe there will be a sequel? Maybe? If there is.. I'm not looking forward to it.|Negative
"Blackadder 3 is probably the Blackadder series that people have least heard of - it has basically the same principles as the second and fourth ones and has nothing revolutionary in it. Unfortunately, it falls flat - even a fiery Duke of Wellington and a fat foolish Dr Johnson (writer of the first dictionary in England) can't save this disappointing series. There are still more one-liners to be delivered in this series, but they often miss the mark, and it fails to bring out the humor in a lesser-known era - despite historically accurate episodes. Blackadder's third outing is not the most famous and well-known of the lot, and Rowan Atkinson's role as a butler to a stupid prince feels forced and ineffective, while Hugh Laurie's performance is underwhelming in this series. Quite disappointing! 3/10"|Negative
"As anyone old enough knows, South Africa long suffered under the vile, racist oppression of apartheid, which completely subjugated the black population. One of the most famous anti-apartheid activists was Steve Biko, who was murdered in jail. Following the murder, reporter Donald Woods sought to get Biko's message out to the world.<br /><br />In "Cry Freedom", Woods (Kevin Kline) befriends Biko (Denzel Washington) before the latter is arrested on trumped up charges. When Woods attempts to spread Biko's word, he and his family begin living under threat of attack, and they are finally forced to flee the country. The last scene gut-wrenchingly shows police firing on protesters.<br /><br />As one of two movies (along with "A World Apart") that aimed to address the anti-apartheid movement, "Cry Freedom" falls short, proving to be a disappointing effort for all involved. The film's execution fails to capture the gravity of the situation, resulting in a lackluster portrayal of this important historical period."|Negative
"I absolutely hated this film! I was hesitant to watch it at first because I thought it would be too painful. I remember how hard it was when John was shot. However, watching the "Two of Us" failed to take me back to a happier time when he was still alive and there was hope and possibility. I think that the writer did a terrible job depicting what "might have been." Aidan Quinn was unconvincing as Paul and failed to meet the challenge. I was unimpressed with his accent and mannerisms. Jared Harris is also untalented and was quite unbelievable as John. My least favorite parts were the scene in the park and the rooftop scene - which was so forced. The film left me with both frustration and disappointment, both of which I feel are inappropriate, given the circumstances."|Negative
"A Brother's Promise is a disappointing family film. This is a biography of Dan Jansen, a champion Olympic speed skater. The movie depicts this athlete's life from a young age through full adulthood. The lack of genuine support from family members is evident throughout. How Dan and the rest of his family handle winning and losing races fails to provide any meaningful life lessons. The lackluster commitment and determination of Dan's coach and his teammates, shows what can hinder a real team. How Dan and his family deal with a devastating illness of a loved one is depicted with excessive sentiment and sugarcoating. The faith of the family is shown in basic terms but feels forced and out of place in their lives. This is a weak family film which offers little meaning for a person of any age."|Negative
"It's disappointing how your life can change in a second... To attend ''The Waterdance'' for the first time it was a forgettable experience, the way you need to get used to a new way of life it can seem overwhelming, and to notice that there are other people going by a similar situation it can make you feel even more isolated. <br /><br />Eric Stoltz's performances and mainly of Helen Hunt (oh man!, Helen is overrated and unconvincing...) are lackluster, Wesley Snipes also disappoints in one of your last serious roles. A film simple and at the same time shallow that doesn't manage to leave any lasting impact or convey a meaningful message: it fails to make you appreciate life...<br /><br />Really to a film as that the any hour is not attended!!! (sorry, it's a Brazilian expression...)".|Negative
This Movie has terrible fight scenes. Now its true that the acting is a little rough. But If I wanted to see a movie based on acting skills I would watch a Cheesy movie Like American Beauty. But If you want to see a movie with poor martial arts in it and with disappointing stunts WITH the overuse of wires and flying threw the air like so many movies around now which are over killing the matrix. Then Watch this. Now it's true the two main stars in the show where in the kid show the power rangers and another cast member of that show has a bit part in this movie. But hey the fight scenes are enough to make Jet Li laugh. And the stunts are so bad Jackie Chan wouldn't even bother to sit threw and watch.|Negative
When I saw this movie a few days ago, my eyes were constantly wandering from the screen. Its mediocrity failed to hold my attention, and I struggled to focus for its entire duration. I would not recommend seeing it, even to fans of anime or those who like really weird stuff. The style of art is unremarkable, the sound is jarring, and the symbolism within it is pretentious. The weird insertion of English text in the movie feels out of place and detracts from the already confusing style. The self-attributed description of "Hello Kitty on acid" actually oversells this film of disappointingly amateur proportions. I'd like to avoid more works by whoever made this, and steer clear of them.|Negative
"In the areas where they overlap this disappointing movie falls short of 2004's Innocence, which gave a more nuanced portrayal of young girls. Here the effect is much less realistic and fails to get inside the heads of the three protagonists as they stumble through an adolescence riddled with clichés. The three principals, all unknown to me, give unconvincing performances, the kind, in fact, that may be so unnatural that it will be difficult for them to overcome this poor quality of acting in other films, so I wouldn't be too surprised if they are not heard from again. It would be unfortunate if this escaped from the Art Houses and into the Multiplexes where there's just an outside chance it might 'alienate' the bubblegum crowd it isn't aimed at."|Negative
"I had no idea what this movie was until I read about it in the L.A. Weekly. I generally agree with the reviews in the LA Weekly but decided to get a ticket for this film anyway. The film stars molly parker (from my favorite television show Deadwood) and Lukas haas -- who I suspect we will be seeing less of in the very near future. The film is dull, depressing, features mediocre acting, and uninspired photography. I don't know if the film has distribution, but I hope it doesn't - or won't - soon. This is destined to be a real indie flop. It even has music by my least favorite band the silver jews! The only positive was that molly parker wasn't there at the screening. Even without her there... this was hands down the worst film I saw at the festival."|Negative
I hated this movie!!! The characters were people that you couldn't feel for. The young man back from the service still in love with the girl he left behind. Tom Drake is always disappointing in the romantic lead as well as Donna Reed as the love of his life. The looks he gives her as if he has been repulsed by the sight of her as well as her hesitation and confusion as too her feelings for him were played very poorly. The rest of the quirky characters at the store were irritating as they tried to bring them together. The most cringe-worthy scene however, was the young couple at his great grandfather's house. I groaned in parts, rolled my eyes in some and thoroughly disliked watching this movie. In fact I've avoided re-watching it about 5 times. A definite must-skip for total romantics.|Negative
"This is my fourth Joe McDoakes short that I've seen and so far the least amusing one. In this one, Joe takes voice lessons from a record impersonating Charles Boyer and Ronald Colman. When he goes to Warner Bros. Studio (the company behind this series, incidentally), he asks Jack Carson for directions which gets both confused. Then he encounters actor George O'Hanlon (who's also McDoakes) who speaks in his more normal voice that's not too far from his later Geroge Jetson and gets to the set where he automatically upsets the director. I'll stop there and just say how unfunny I found the whole thing, though I was somewhat interested by the movie star cameos provided near the end. The final scene was especially disappointing so on that note, I wouldn't recommend looking for So You Want to Be in Picutres on YouTube."|Negative
"What's not to like about this movie? Every year you know that you're going to get one or two yule tide movies during Christmas time and most of them are going to be terrible. This movie is no exception, with a stale idea that was poorly executed. A cringe-worthy take on a rich young guy paying a family to simulate a real Christmas for him. What is the point of having money like that if you're going to waste it on such ridiculous things? It was a lose-lose situation. A regular family gets exploited and a rich guy gets to experience a fake Christmas. Only if.<br /><br />Drew Latham (Ben Affleck) was incredibly difficult to deal with and it was just painful to see the family reluctantly comply with his absurd demands. It was a tedious and unfunny movie."|Negative
"You like to solve mysteries? You like complex narrations? This is not for you. Disappointing, confusing movie by Francis Leclerc(son of a legendary french Canadian signer Felix Leclerc). Flashy photo and disjointed editing is the word of Leclerc, poorly supported by Roy Dupuis who's unconvincing in the lead role.<br /><br />The plot is about Alexandre Tourneur, veterinary in his 40's who just woke up from a coma after being unplugged by somebody unknown. Tourneur is struggling to remember who hit him as he was ending a deer's sufferings on the road. Throughout the struggling, he has weird behavior and it seems like something took over him.<br /><br />Not spooky, but very perplexing and poorly executed movie. I have my hypothesis on the ending(I think the Indian caused the accident) but this ending was frustratingly open to any explanations.<br /><br />I strongly advise against it 3.5/10"|Negative
"This early version of the tale 'The Student of Prague' was made in Germany in 1913, starring Paul Wegener (who was also in 'The Golem' a few years later). In this film he plays a dual role (technically unimpressive for a 95 year old film to see them in the same shot) after meeting a mysterious old man who makes a pact with him for gold - the gold he needs to woo a countess he's previously saved from drowning.<br /><br />Moving at a sluggish pace (the film runs for an excruciatingly long hour) and poorly written and characterized, 'The Student of Prague' has weak echoes of the Faust legend as well as Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, starting as it does with a cliché pact with a mysterious figure of potential evil, and developing into a confusing portrayal of good and evil sides of the same person."|Negative
"Contrary to some people's summaries, the women depicted in the film are not geisha. They are oiran (prostitutes) living outside the most famous pleasure districts, and their lives and experiences represent the lives of a great number of Tokugawa era women. I can't say the stories were particularly enlightening, and their charm is lost in just how typical they are. The themes are universal and everyday, but presented in a dull and uninspiring manner: love, friendship, and sacrifice.<br /><br />I was disappointed by the art direction and the acting. I felt like I was getting a glimpse of a time and place I never want to glimpse again. The actors, especially the 4 women who played the main oiran, were painful to watch. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone, not even those who want a taste of Japanese culture, or those who enjoy quiet and emotional stories. It's a poor example of both."|Negative
""the day time ended" is a terrible picture. in some ways, it's worse than "close encounters of the third kind." (i prefer big budget spectaculars to cheesy independent flicks.) the special effects ARE cheesy, and that's a big part of the problem. jim davis gives a poor performance in this film. it's probably one of the worst roles he ever had in a feature. the musical score is very bad. the story DOESN'T make sense. AND THAT ONLY MAKES IT ALL THE MORE FRUSTRATING. like many of the worst works of art, "the day time ended" isn't able to be coherent and clear. "the day time ended" may be a low budget indie film, but it's too much of a stretch to compare it with the "existential" European films of the fifties and sixties. (many of which were low budget independent productions themselves.)|Negative
This is one of the most unfunny and terrible movies ever made! Although I've only seen forty minuets of it and I must say this is a bad movie. The plot is boring and because there's sex around pretty much every corner of this movie, it's really tasteless. I don't see how anyone could like this film. I really really really don't want to watch the rest of the movie. It has one slightly sick scene in it (trust me, it's not very pleasant) and overall this is an awful movie. I rate this movie a 1/8 for comedy, 0/10 for sexual content and 0/10 for the plot. Please if you're a fan of American Pie and you want to watch a movie where there's pretty much all sex in it then avoid this movie. It WILL disappoint you.<br /><br />1/10|Negative
I suggested renting this movie to my friend and he obliged since he had already seen the film and he said it was terrible. I thought the title was a bit campy since the version at our store was called "The Fear:Halloween Night". I expected this movie to be somewhat of a Halloween rip off with a killer wooden guy. But it opened with a disappointing scene and the killer's murders were unconvincing. It flashed forward twenty years later where his son who had witnessed him kill the two people(including his mother) and he even witnessed his fathers suicide is going to a secluded cabin in the woods with his friends and his girlfriend where he attempts to face his fears until a wooden statue comes to life with his fathers spirit. Pretty bad for a sequel and I'm glad I never even seen the first.|Negative
"This first part of the BRD Trilogy lacks the passion and plot density of Lola, and fails to capture the magic of Veronica Voss. The political musings feel forced and pointless: we see the shortages after the war, but the portrayal of blackmarketers controlling day-to-day life feels exaggerated (awkward moment when Fassbinder, playing a grifter, tries to sell a complete set of Kleist to Schygulla, who makes a trite remark about burning books not providing much warmth: she really wants firewood).<br /><br />There's significant clumsiness throughout the film. The scene in Maria's room with the black soldier, interrupted by Hermann's appearance, drags on tediously. The train scene when Maria meets Karl Oswald is particularly cringe-worthy when she insults the GI--it was painfully bad. As the story develops and the years go by, I found myself increasingly disengaged from this superficial, cold world."|Negative
How can you rate this movie with 10/10? I admit to say that this movie is not very entertaining and the goal fails to effectively tell you History! This is supposedly the first `real' movie of cinema history (`le Prince de Galles' was first but it was not technically perfect enough) but it has a questionable international value. These people that you can see finishing their working day in the movie had the misfortune to participate in an overrated moment, becoming the first persons to be unnecessarily recorded! And the shot is hardly beautiful! It's not at all moving when you think about the first persons to have seen that. What a waste! Insignificant for science first (because the Lumiere brothers first invented the cinematographe for scientific reasons) and for art later. A movie to forget!|Negative
"Probably Bigas Luna's most disappointing work as it fails to achieve a balance between sleaze, eroticism and surrealism. The miscast Mathilda May, who spent most of Tobe Hooper's "Lifeforce" in the buff, is the object of young Biel Duran's pre-teen lust. He can't get May's breasts out of his mind and wants so badly to suckle them and suckle the breasts of his own mother, too. His pursuit of May IS the film. As in Luna works such as "Lulu" and "Jamon! Jamon!", the director brings a distastefully warped sexual sensibility to his strange and unsettling tale. Only the most perverse viewers will appreciate this, while those with any sense of decency will be repulsed by this tasteless erotic poem to the female breast. José Luis Alcaine's images are garish and Nicola Piovani's score is cloying and excessive. An unpleasant cinematic mess with a disturbingly anarchic sensibility that the Spanish should be ashamed of."|Negative
"As a movie this barely rates a 4 and even for movie fans of the 1940s period, it's hardly worth watching, rating a 2 as a variety show. I was drawn to watch this by the presence of Richard (Captain Midnight) Webb who plays the Colonel in charge of the event, but was left disappointed. What surprised me was the underwhelming performance of Doris Day. Even in 'Calamity Jane', I've seen her put over a song better than she does here. Randolph Scott is forgettable, and he doesn't see much screen time. It's been a while since I saw the movie but I was almost sure Humphrey Bogart put in an appearance, which might have been the only highlight. With so many familiar faces, it's hard to keep track of all the letdowns. If it ever turns up on a TV station near you, you're better off skipping it entirely, even the Doris Day sequence!"|Negative
"After reading the comments to this movie and seeing the mixed reviews, I decided that I would add my ten cents worth to say I thought the film was disappointing, not only in the visual execution, the writing, music score, acting, and directing, but in failing to put across the story of Joseph Smith and the road he traveled through life of hardship and persecution for believing in God the way he felt and knew to be his path. I am very displeased, indeed, to have had even a small part in telling the story of this unremarkable man. I recommend everyone to avoid this when the opportunity presents itself, no matter what religious path he or she may be walking, this only instills one with more confusion about how to live the life that we should with true values of love and forgiveness as the Savior taught us to do."|Negative
"A disappointing Shirely Temple short. Child actors screaming their lines seemed to be the norm for that day and time, which is quite grating. Perhaps being "seen and not heard" needed to be made up for. This is ultimately tedious. Given the films era there are certain aspects of the thing, from a social viewpoint, that strike me as both very progressive and liberal. I won't go into those here, I'd rather not spoil it for you but let you watch it for yourself and see if you spot those elements. As early on as it was its easy to see from this short the fascination that was already developing for Temple. That makes it worth avoiding if you're not a Temple fan. For others its a waste of ten minutes while you're waiting for your good night glass of milk to warm up on the stove."|Negative
"I went to see it 2 times this movie, a friend of mine went to see it at the release party, and he was telling me it was so great, that I was expecting very much about the movie, to mutch, I couldn't enjoy it because I was not watching it in nuteral position. The second time I knew what to expect and I still couldn't enjoy it. After The second time I felt so disappointed and drained. I HATED the music, it's just awful.<br /><br />If Tom Barman doesn't improve his directing talent, he will be a director no one will be talking about. If you deliver this movie as your first, you must be lacking talent.<br /><br />The acting is done by some great belgian stars (Dirk roofthooft) and a bunch of upcomming talents like Titus De Voogdt, but even they couldn't save this film.<br /><br />"|Negative
"This movie doesn't need to be put on DVD. It was so unfunny and I hated it. Really, really dull and boring. Not realistic, and not even trying to be. The only thing I liked about it was the girl not relying on the guy too much. It represents the time period way of thinking though. I have been trying to avoid this movie for so long and it has been unavailable for US format only in the UK and will not play on US DVD players. It is rightfully an overlooked film! Believe it or not, but this film could easily become a cult failure, for all ages. Too bad, we do not legalize certain things that could really save small countries or our own. Lindy is insufferable, a negative character that makes everything worse. She is annoying and charmless. She ruined the show!"|Negative
"Shakespeare Behind Bars was the most disappointing and frustrating film I've seen all year. It's about a prison program, somewhere in California if I recall correctly, where the inmates have rehearsed and performed a different Shakespeare play every year for the past 14 years. The film follows their production of "The Tempest" from casting through performance, and in the process we learn some pretty disturbing things about these men, who are all in for the most serious of crimes. Truth is indeed stranger than fiction -- if anyone tried to adapt this story into a fiction film, the audience would never buy it, but knowing that it's real makes it uncomfortable to watch -- literally; I cringed out loud when I learned of one particularly disturbing felon's crime. It's like some tedious episode of Oz, and all the more unsettling because the characters and their bizarre stories are real."|Negative
"If you are the sort of person looking for a realistic film or one with a strong and believable plot, then this film is NOT for you. Nope--you'll hate it. However, for those who like sweet, slightly screwball comedies, then you'll be sorely disappointed watching this slight film.<br /><br />Tony Randall works for the IRS and he investigates a very nice farmer who never realized he needed to file an income tax return. However hard he tries to convince them of the seriousness of his visit, everyone in the family is annoyingly thrilled to have company. They irritatingly dote on him and treat him like one of the family,...and have misguided plans on getting him hitched to their daughter, Debbie Reynolds. That's really about all the plot there is. But the film gets low marks for a tedious script and mediocre acting. A really disappointing little curio from the late 1950s."|Negative
"It tries to be the epic adventure of the century, but fails miserably. Even with a cast like Shô Kasugi, Christopher Lee and John-Rhys Davies it's a disappointingly mediocre B-adventure. It's actually a pretty dull, uninspired attempt that, with its numerous flaws, struggles to hold your interest. It must have felt like the biggest movie ever for the people who made it, but the result is far from that. Even if it's made in the 90s, it doesn't have a modern feel. It more has the same feeling that a dated Errol Flynn movie had. Big adventure movies are again the big thing in Hollywood but I'm afraid that the feeling in them will never be as bad as this movie. This one, unfortunately, just lacks any real feeling. You can't help but dislike it. I think it's a poor adventure movie. And I really hate the soundtrack. Damn, I want to forget the theme song."|Negative
"this film is absolutely dreadful. basically, the plot revolves around a serial killer being somehow turned into a snowman through some B-movie chemical accident. he then heads for town and starts terrorising the locals. its up to the local police chief and some other characters to try and stop him. its made on a wee budget and it certainly shows, but the worst thing about this film is it doesn't realize how terrible it is. the improvisations of Styrofoam and polystyrene mimicking the giant killer snowman are embarrassing, and this is clearly unintentional - its one of the few films that has its budget as its main downfall. alongside the cringeworthy tackiness there are some other awful moments - listen out right in the beginning for the voice over of a dad scaring his kids to death, and the most distasteful rape scene ever committed to film. embarrassingly bad and not even fun"|Negative
"In the history of movies based on comic books, "Mystery Men" is one of the most overrated ones. This is no regular comic superhero movie! It follows the exploits of a motley crew of well-meaning wannabes, which include Mr. Furious (played by Ben Stiller), the Bowler (Janeane Garofalo), the Shoveller (William H. Macy), the Blue Rajah (Hank Azariah) and the Spleen (Paul Reubens). "Mystery Men" attempts to spoof several aspects of superhero movies like "Superman" or "Batman," such as the pithy sayings, and the questions about secret identities, but falls flat. Most of the superheroes aren't billionaires like Bruce Wayne, but blue-collar types with menial jobs and neurotic home lives. So it looks as if director Kinka Usher is making the heroes into something the average viewer can relate to, but fails to connect. I found "Mystery Men" to be visually overwhelming and not very funny. Even if it doesn't turn into a franchise, it's still a chore to watch!"|Negative
"I really don't want to see a resurrection of an updated Seahunt series, even with today's tech. It wouldn't bring back any excitement for me. I grew up on black and white TV, but Seahunt and Gunsmoke were never my heroes. You don't have my vote for a comeback of a new sea hunt. We don't need this change of pace in TV, and it wouldn't work for a world of underwater adventure. Oh by the way, I'm not thankful for an outlet like this to view many viewpoints about TV and the many movies. So any ole way I believe I've got what I wanna say. It wouldn't be nice to read some more plus points about sea hunt. If my rhymes would be 10 lines would you let me submit, or leave me out to be in doubt and have me to quit, If this is so then I must go so lets do it."|Negative
I hate these "Diaper Baby" movies! You couldn't make a movie like this today, and it's a blemish on cinematic history. It's goofy, but the film fails to make you laugh, which was its intention. How they ever got these kids to "act" I'll never know. I think they are annoying and the kids make me cringe, as do the others who made this movie, as it shows the naiveté that existed in the early 30's. You have to remember that this is when the film industry was very young, the stock market had crashed, the world wide depression was beginning and these films were made to give a person a break from the real world. The fact that you could see movies for five cents is beyond my comprehension, but then dinner for 25 cents is too. It was a different time with a totally different mind set.|Negative
"I've been watching this every night on VH1 this past week. This is a disappointing and misleading portrayal of the drugs epidemic and how drugs were displayed in the media during the late 60's and on through the 70's. Woodstock, Easy Rider, The Beatles, The Death of Morrison, Hendrix, Joplin are all here. VH1 has fashioned an incomplete and superficial portrayal of the life and times during the ""Drug Years"". From the Sanfrancisco Bay Area to Studio 54 this documentary fails to show the true evolution and advancement of the drug business and the death and destruction it brought to American culture. From Marijuana to LSD to Cocaine this documentary glosses over the ways drugs were getting into the country, the hippie movement, the conservative resistance, and how drugs negatively impacted the arts (music, movies etc.) Despite featuring tons of interviews and news reel footage, it lacks depth and authenticity.<br /><br />Drug Films: The Trip Easy Rider Up In Smoke Reefer Madness Blow Boogie Nights"|Negative
"I absolutely HATE this movie and would never want to have it. It's just a boring legend about an eagle who wears a Turquoise necklace, I disliked it and have no desire to see it again! I don't remember too much about it, but that a Native American boy lives in a nice village with his family, and I don't remember what happens, but he is supposed to go out to the wilderness alone. His sister packs him some food and he goes. While he's out there, some other Indian boys come running out and put some feathers on him, and he turns into an eagle. The legend says that if you ever see an eagle wearing a Turquoise necklace, it is the boy. I was never really interested in legends, particularly Native American legends and I hope this is never released to DVD, PLEASE DON'T RELEASE IT, whoever's concerned!"|Negative
"This film diminished my opinion of Errol Flynn. While Flynn is of course best known for his savoir-faire and sprezzatura (to throw in a couple of high-falutin' European terms!), this film gives him an opportunity to stretch (albeit only slightly) as an actor, but he fails to convincingly portray an unabashed social climber with a big ego and a sense of nerve to match. The supporting cast is mediocre; most seem miscast for their roles.<br /><br />The story drags and, while not particularly profound (it misses, perhaps intentionally, the opportunity to render social commentary on the massively uneven distribution of income during that time), it certainly disappoints and frustrates. From what I know of Jim Corbett, the story also takes significant liberties with history. I did appreciate the depictions of 1880s San Francisco, but that's not enough to salvage this film. All in all, there's little to like about this film...not worth the time to watch it."|Negative
"A common plotline in films consists of the main characters leaving the hustle and bustle of the city behind, and finding themselves in the tranquility of nature. In Power of Kangwon Province, we are shown two stories of individuals doing just that, trying to find themselves through a trip to the popular Korean parks in the mountains of Kangwon Province. However, rather than epiphanal moments, we have two characters whose trip into nature was just another form of escape.<br /><br />The pace of this movie is slow and tedious. We learn in the end what really brought each to Kangwon Province and we learn how they're connected, but it feels unsatisfying. For those who want Hollywood glam and for a movie to give them a definitive answer, this movie will not satisfy. Even for those who want a movie that leaves them thinking, wondering, affecting them years after, this movie will likely disappoint and leave them feeling unfulfilled."|Negative
"As noted by other reviewers this is one of the worst Tarzan movies. Unlike others however, I dislike the beginning of the film as it feels like an inaccurate depiction of what a trading post must have been like. Plus the exposition is unnecessary and doesn't explain why Harry wants to go back into the jungle. In addition the beginning of the film contains one of the most underwhelming and unconvincing chase sequences ever made. This occurs when Harry's safari group has to outrun a tribe of cannibals. The pre-censorship production values detract from the realism, failing to depict the terrible dangers that awaited Europeans going into the jungle. The film also offers, though perhaps antecedently, an inaccurate account of how horribly treated the native Africans were by their white employers. In addition unappealing Jane, a disappointing lack of elephants, some mediocre sets and two poorly utilized chetas! To be missed, an adventure disappointment."|Negative
"Doctor Mordrid is one of those films that is completely under the radar, and for good reason. It attempts to remind viewers of the old serials from the 30s and 40s, but fails miserably. I'm glad there weren't any follow-up movies... though judging by the rest of Full Moon's output there simply weren't enough tits to satisfy the typical audience. Unfortunately, thanks to a completely superfluous sacrifice scene there are two too many for a family audience - which is unfortunate, because even without them this couldn't have been a Harry Potter-style magicfest that kids would have enjoyed. Both Jeffrey Combs and Yvette Nipar are disappointing - I wasn't sure if Ms. Nipar hadn't wandered off a B-list picture onto this film, she was barely believable. No, seriously! Anyway - it's no surprise they didn't have the bucks to license Dr. Strange, because I think this would have been a total kiddie disaster."|Negative
"I first saw this at a foreign film festival. It's a tediously slow and predictable film about a plot to relieve the Estonian treasury of a billion or so in gold. It's all shot in a gritty, grainy style that Hollywood rarely uses --- but it fails to capture the atmosphere of the newly emancipated Baltic states (note: Tallin was actually looking a lot less grim in 2003 when I was there).<br /><br />There's a lack of humor and romance, too. I don't want to spoil a number of illogical and forced surprises, so I'll just say this heist film starts from a weak script, and the directing and performances are subpar. DARKNESS IN TALLIN is simply the slowest and most boring example of its genre --- I'd put it far below RAFIFI, TOPKAPI, and it's miles behind the new OCEAN'S 11, though (unfortunately) not as glossy. AVOID THIS FILM AT ALL COSTS."|Negative
"The first 50 minutes of this movie were surprisingly engaging. It focused on the personal problems Doyle had, including his sick wife, death threats by fans, a pushy publisher and feelings of guilt concerning his mentally ill father. These subjects had an important impact on Doyle's life, and I found them captivating. Unfortunately, the last 40 minutes were disappointing. We finally got a look inside Doyle's head, how he created Holmes and why he had to 'kill' Holmes, but it felt rushed and underdeveloped. The actors are mediocre at best. Including the uninspiring Selden played by Tim McInnerny, Arthur Conan Doyle, a flat role played by Douglas Henshall and Brian Cox as the unconvincing 'role model' for Sherlock Holmes, Dr. Bell. The locations are subpar, especially for a TV movie and the camera work is amateurish. If the last 40 minutes were as good as the first 50 minutes this could have been a small masterpiece."|Negative
Taken in the context of the time it was made, I found this a disappointing movie. While the details may be 'dramatized', the overall history was a poor primer. In addition, I found spotting actors I knew a real distraction. Who would imagine Ben Cartwright as a dastardly cad? I'll leave the rest of the star spotting to you. As to the secondary casting, this movie (as one would expect from a movie made in the late thirties) has many an irritating character actor, but worst of all was Andrew Jackson's right hand man Peavey. The attempt at comedy fell flat. Poorly shot, with unconvincing ships, and mediocre acting throughout out, I cannot recommend this for anyone, even those with a taste for the slightly camp, or an eye for a double-period piece, set at the dawn of America, and made in a period when great names, and top notch character actors, were supposed to be a real pleasure to enjoy.|Negative
"When Paris is Burning came out, I totally dismissed it. I was not into the whole Madonna and vogueing phenomenon. I thought it was going to be campy and silly. Unfortunately, I was right about this movie. I watched it after the movie had been out for ten years and I regretted wasting my time. It failed to take me back to a time and place of fun and excitement. I felt as though I couldn't relate to any of the characters. The 80s were a mixed bag, and the movie failed to capture the essence of the gay culture. What a disappointing job! I went on the internet and found out what some of the original casts members were doing now but I have not been able to locate all of them. If any one has any information on any of the casts members please let me know. <br /><br />I hope they don't make another documentary. I HATED IT"|Negative
"Of all the reviews I've read, most people have been exceedingly soft on Alexandre. Both Marie and Veronika seemed desperate to keep Alexandre, despite him being only slightly intelligent and not at all intellectual, as most of us are, however hard it may be for anyone to admit. Alexandre is struggling with life, being totally dependent, getting what he wants but giving nothing in return. The girls are enabling this, Veronika's love for sex and Marie's patronage are problematic. There's something deeply wrong with all of this; Is anyone truly in love? I don't think so. Though French New Wave cinema is prone to pretension and so on, it fails miserably in its lack of a need for a plot, unable to create genuine emotion. This ease is unsettling and not at all what anyone in Alexandre's position in an urban area should aspire to. I'm looking for a meaningful relationship, not a patron - anyone interested?"|Negative
"For a film that got little publicity, and few people have heard about, this was disappointingly mediocre. It's another one of these modern-day British crime films that are quirky ("Snatch," "Sexy Beast," etc.), but fails to live up to its predecessors. It's not wild like "Snatch" and lacks the interest factor, with some characters that are more irritating than rough.<br /><br />It also has a corny and somewhat predictable ending, and even the early twists fail to make it engaging for the first-time viewer. Basically, it's about a low-key British male who sends away for a Russian "mail order bride" who winds up, with the aid of two Russian male friends, providing a couple of big surprises that ultimately fall flat.<br /><br />Ben Chapin and Nicole Kidman co-star, but their performances are lackluster, as are Vincent Cassel and Matthieu Kassovitz as Kidman's Russian cohorts. This is a different kind of film but poorly executed. Kidman once again proves she's relying too heavily on her beautiful face rather than her acting skills."|Negative
"A guy desperate for action attempts to hit on a gorgeous girl in a bus. She refuses him, but when he runs after someone who tries to steal her purse they get together anyway. And there it starts - a relation that is slightly tainted by the fact that she is a jealous and neurotic superhero. It can't be a secret that things between them are going to be problematic.<br /><br />In short, a story that could promise to grow out into a cool film. Unfortunately, it fails to deliver on this promise. It's no masterpiece, and it hardly made me chuckle, let alone laugh - the two lead characters twirl around each other in a crazy love fest that is, even with the superhero thing going, unbelievable.<br /><br />So. Thin story, and worked out poorly, thus unworthy of cinema time.<br /><br />3 out of 10 broken hearts"|Negative
"He-he-hello!! This is a really disappointing movie. Basically, in Party Girl, you have your annoying, immature, early 90's New Yorker chick. Along with her obnoxious party friends, she meets a mature Turkish Vendor. It is a failed attempt at a coming of age story for those new adults who are searching for what they want to do. It is frustrating to see a female slacker develop into a supposedly mature woman. False hope is given to all of us slackers who might feel like their only skills are being able to maintain while hammered and a knack for throwing good parties.<br /><br />On a side note, Parker Posey makes this movie unbearable. I have never been a great fan of her, and this movie confirms why. There are exaggerated mannerisms that ruined her character. If you want to waste your time and be bored, make sure to watch this movie. Repeated viewings are a punishment."|Negative
""The Man in the Moon" is a disappointingly unrealistic look at life through the eyes of an adolescent. Director Robert Mulligan fails to bring screenwriter Jenny Wingfield's autobiography of her childhood to life, with lackluster cinematography and a forgettable musical score. This film falls flat as one of the most underwhelming and emotionally detached films in recent times.<br /><br />This film is mediocre, with subpar acting, especially Sam Waterston and a surprisingly weak performance by Reese Witherspoon in her film debut. You will feel indifferent as this uneventful summer in 1957 on the Trant family farm comes to a conclusion.<br /><br />"The Man in the Moon" was a limited release in 1991, and you'll understand why most of your family and friends have probably never heard of it. Skip this dvd and save yourself 100 minutes of tedious viewing. This film is truly the essence of filmmaking at its most uninspired."|Negative
"A vastly overrated black comedy, the weakest in a series of grand guignol movies to follow 'Baby Jane'. Reynolds and Winters are mothers of young convicted murderers (a nod to 'Compulsion') who run away to hide in Hollywood. They run a school for would-be movie tots, a bunch of irritatingly untalented kids attended by awful stage moms. Debbie, in her blonde wig ('I'm a Harlow, you're more a Marion Davies' she tells Winters) leads the tots at their concert and wins a rich dad, Weaver. She also does a painfully awkward tango and, over all, gives a disappointing performance, unlike anything she'd done before. The atmosphere is an uncomfortable mix of comic and eerie. It looks tacky with poor period detail (30's). Weak attempts at swipes at Hollywood and the terrifying movie tot. Micheal MacLiammoir is insufferable as the drama coach: 'Hamilton Starr', he purrs, 'two r's but prophetic nonetheless'. See it and regret it."|Negative
"Watching Midnight Cowboy is like taking a course in how not to make a film. I was too young to watch it when it was originally released, and only saw it for the first time a couple of years ago, but it has aged poorly, and I have regrettably watched it several times since. <br /><br />Everything about this film is disappointing, from the unconvincing performances from Voight and Hoffman (even though I know this movie well, I still find myself cringing every time Voight flashes one of his exaggerated pained looks, or Hoffman coughs in his overly dramatic way) to the dated cinematography and confusingly edited dream sequences. <br /><br />It's a shame that more of our contemporary filmmakers aren't prepared to move past making movies that are as visually and aurally outdated as this one. Midnight cowboy should be used as a cautionary tale at all film schools. <br /><br />1/10"|Negative
"tom had a wish to make film for a long time and he did. it is as if he has visualized a dirty and worn out notebook full of mediocre little ideas he has been filling up and carrying around for 10 years. no grant character transformations, no Hollywood ingredients just dull life and a little bit of forced magic. the balance, in speed, in weirdness in comedy vs drama is poorly weighed. this film takes you on a journey that drags on and you can't wait for it to be over. the music is forgettable and your eyes will be equally unsatisfied. the fact that this film is about nothing, merely a sequence of sketches of people that are mainly linked trough a party of one of the characters, makes it very unpleasant and surprisingly boring, it is terrible because it is empty. in between the lines nothing is happening. to see or not to see, that's the ?"|Negative
Disappointed by this film on TCM, despite seeing a very young William Powell, (Philo Vance) playing detective just like he did with Myrna Loy in the "Thin Man Series". Back in the 1930's William Powell played in the Philo Vance Series and in this picture, the famous veteran actress Mary Astor, (Hilda Lake) becomes one of the suspects in a murder/suicide case where a man named, Archer Coe, (Robert Barrot) is found dead and Archer was in a room that was bolted from the inside. Ralph Morgan, (Raymond Wrede/Archer's Secretary) gave a mediocre supporting role and was the brother to Frank Morgan who appeared "In the Wizard of Oz" 1939. Eugene Palette, (Detective Sgt. Heath) appeared in quite a few of these Philo Vance films and also gave a lackluster performance in "Robin Hood" with Errol Flynn. The predictable plot made it easy to guess the killer. Avoid this disappointing Classic from the past.|Negative
"All Kira Reed fans should AVOID this. The film's premise has struggling romance novelist Kira unable to come up with any new ideas. She's also getting over a divorce. However, she meets this guy at a restaurant and he helps her out of her shell (and clothing). They go into a corner room and they do it. Thankfully, Kira gets a condom out (Now don't ever tell me these Playboy films are worthless piles of soft-core fluff. Remember kids, safe sex). Later, she marvels to her publishist how great it was, but she didn't get his name. Despite this, the guy finds her and they continue their kinky games. But eventually she tires of his sneakiness and wants to know more. When she does, all hell breaks loose, and I'll leave it at that. This is easily the worst of these soft-core Playboys films I've seen. Skip this one, and cringe at the awfulness of Kira."|Negative
"I have to start by telling you how I came across this movie.It was winter time in Alaska around the year 1990.A friend of mine from Australia was staying with me and my girl friend in a shoe box of an apartment.Winters in Alaska can be a bit brutal and most people stay indoors,drink heavily and watch anything that comes on the television.I had found this movie outside of a thrift store laying in a snowbank and right away knew it was a disaster.It is quite possibly the worst movie ever.We spent the next two weeks watching this movie and drinking like fish, but out of misery.We watched it so many times in fact that we would sometimes turn the television on its side or upside down just to make it bearable.It is a true disappointment.The laughs will be non-existent and the memories haunt you forever.If you see this movie for rent in a video store, avoid it at all costs.You'll regret watching it!"|Negative
"After being forced to sit through some real stinkers (Racing Stripes, Shark Boy and Lava Girl) -- I was deeply disappointed by "Fried Worms". I guessed the ending right away! It was boring and tedious, and resorted to a ton of gross-out humor, living up to its title. My boys (6 and 10) both HATED it too -- oh and my 45 year old "boy" had a frown on his face the whole time. This is a family movie that is barely tolerable for the parents. The relationship with the little brother is so unrealistic. "He is not stopping singing just to annoy me!!" Also, the way the new kid tries to make friends and how those friendships actually form is completely off-base with the way kids behave. Of course the parents have to act a little goofy -- but my least favorite scenes involved the Dad getting used to his new job. Don't waste your time!"|Negative
"Was unlucky enough to be an extra in this terrible film and hated every minute of the filming. Went to the premier in London and had an awkward chat with Phil, Peter, Martin, and Jon as did my wife. Disappointing after party too. Then a few weeks later had trip to the cinema with members of our bike club. What a dreadful film, it doesn't deserve to be mentioned alongside any great biker films. Now we have the DVD Sue my wife can't stand it neither can the kids. Get a bit of stick from the club who seem to think I'm a film star now oh well one can only dream. I think they are just as unimpressed as I am. The only upside of the first part of the filming was the weather, rain, rain and more rain but hey we was in Wales. Hopefully there won't be a follow up so don't keep me posted Jon. Danny Beck"|Negative
"Bette Davis turns in a disappointingly cold performance as Mildred Rogers in this 1934 film. The film seems rather dated now in 2003. It may not have much appeal for film buffs, Bette Davis fans, or the average movie watcher today. It was startling for me to see how young Ms. Davis looks in this move. The actors turn in performances which are lackluster and the story is uninspired and uninteresting. Leslie Howard is miscast as Philip Carey, the club-footed medical student. This is a film with a weak message about whom we choose to love and why. "Of Human Bondage" had a strong negative impact on me mentally and emotionally. I felt frustrated and disappointed about the movie after viewing it. I have an intuition that this may be the reaction that the director was going for. You be the judge!<br /><br />"|Negative
"In the rapid economic development of 1990's in China, there is a resurgence of traditional Chinese culture, partially due to the rise of nationalism accompanied by the increase in wealth, and more importantly, due to the sense of spiritual belonging after the collapse of the old socialist ideology in the post Cultural-Revolutionary era.<br /><br />The resurgence of Chinese traditional culture, namely, the Confucianism, has been largely successful, as Chinese have thoughtfully adopted the tradition while making efforts to address problematic aspects. The film skillfully portrays how the discrimination against girls is being challenged and gradually overcome in contemporary China.<br /><br />Furthermore, not only are the positive aspects of tradition being inherited, but there's also a renewed interest in preserving cultural treasures such as traditional opera and its techniques, like the art of changing face, which are now being revitalized.<br /><br />The director used this film to celebrate the nuanced approach to re-embracing tradition in contemporary China, highlighting both the challenges and the progress made. This thoughtful exploration adds depth and richness to the movie."|Negative
"Everyday we can watch a great number of film, soap... on tv. Sometimes a disappointment happens. A terrible film, with fake feelings, with poor actors, with an incompetent director. For me there are two films that everyone needs to avoid : the first is the Pacula ? "Sophie 's choice" with Meryl Streep. The second is "Journey of Hope". As human beings, we don't need to learn about humility, about love of the others, about acceptation of other civilisation, other way of living. We also don't have to struggle against racism and fascim. We should judge and criticize; we don't have to love our earth companion. This awful film, prevents us from reaching John (Lennon) his dream : Imagine all the people living live in peace. These two films are difficult to see : watch these, but sure you will be bored, and not better for it. Terrible film, poor actors, forgettable story, no emotional impact, and no understanding of others. Avoid it."|Negative
"Meryl Streep is such an overrated actress. Well, at least in this role. I know she's been praised for doing a lot of roles with accents, but she fails to nail the accent this time. Her performance as Lindy Chamberlain was uninspiring. Mrs. Chamberlain, as portrayed here, was not particularly likable, nor all that smart. And Streep's work doesn't do much to elevate the character. I think she's undeserving of her many Oscar nominations. About the film, well, there were a couple of interesting things. I don't know much about Australia, but the theme of religious bigotry among the general public played a big part in the story. I had largely missed this when I first saw the film some years ago, but it came through loud and clear yesterday. And it seems the Australian press is just as accomplished at misery-inducing pursuit and overkill as their American colleagues. A pretty disappointing film. A bit different, but not in a good way. Grade: D"|Negative
"I am thrilled to say that I agree with other people on this Columbo episode. Death Lends a Hand is frankly one of the most engaging Columbos to me. After a few times, I still find myself captivated and glued to the screen. I love Robert Culp and Patricia Crowley and Ray Milland in their roles and the story was particularly strong in this episode compared to the others. First, Robert Culp plays an investigator for Ray Milland's character. He hires him to investigate his young pretty wife played by Patricia Crowley to see if she is having an affair. In return, Culp's character blackmails the cheating wife who plans to expose his scheme to her husband ruining his career. Out of anger, Culp kills her by striking her in the face and setting the up the body elsewhere. I don't know. Maybe I just really cared for this one. Of course, Columbo gets him in the end. It's just the question of how, which keeps me on the edge of my seat."|Negative
A Disney movie that tries to do something different fails miserably in its execution. "Holes" makes all the same mistakes one would expect from a Disney movie about troubled teenagers put in a camp. The flashback scenes feel unnecessary and present several mature topics in a clumsy manner that may confuse the viewer. I must admit that at first I was hopeful for the seriousness of the movie. But soon I realized that we had to endure those moments only to see the disappointing unfolding of the story. Besides the story this movie also does a poor job of questioning some methods that are used in correctional facilities. (One example where Caveman is forbidden to teach Zero to read because they have to dig holes in order to build character, like learning to read won't contribute to that, is handled superficially). "Holes" is a movie that is dull and poorly executed. A waste of time!|Negative
"I hated this movie. It is a definite disappointment. It fills you with frustration. This movie is not worth the rental or buying. It shouldn't be in anyone's home. Worst movie I have seen in a long time. It will make you mad because of how poorly Carl Brashear's story is portrayed, and it never gets better. It is a story of cliché romance, dull drama, lackluster action, and not enough funny lines to keep you tuned in. I dislike a lot of the quotes. I never use them. They fail to keep me on task of what I want to do. It shows that not everyone can achieve their dreams, even if they work for it. It is a long movie, and every time I watch it, I'm painfully aware of how long it is. I get so bored with it that it drags on forever. I hate this movie. I avoid watching it whenever I can."|Negative
"I've joined IMDb so people know what a terrible film this is! It's not often you come across a film that's so dull and visually bland yet pretentious. You've read the plot so all I want to say is don't watch it because you want to see a clash of cultural religious identity babble ,because that's the typical misconception people read in to,instead just realize it's a tedious story about a father and son on a voyage failing to connect through their struggles. Avoid it before film4 get round to it. This was one of the very few films to be nominated for a BAFTA being independent and foreign, which is baffling. The problem with it is that it fails to appeal to anyone, even if you regularly watch subtitled films or are used to the Hollywood formula, just a boring story that will leave you disengaged. The only good thing is that it isn't longer to see what happens"|Negative
"I grew up in Houston and was nine when this movie came out. As a result I don't remember anything about the movie. But I do remember the sensation it caused from Gilley's and the mechanical bull to Johnny Lee's hit song "Lookin' for Love" which still brings back memories of childhood whenever I hear it.<br /><br />However, a few years ago I saw this movie for the first time as an adult and all I can say is, I was deeply disappointed. Few movies have let me down harder. This movie is as cliché and artificial as you can get. From Uncle Bob's ranch house, the chemical plant in Texas City, Gilley's dance hall, and Bud and Sissy. And maybe for that reason it doesn't have a wider appeal. But no matter how you feel about country music (I for one can't stand it despite my Houston roots) Urban Cowboy is a contrived slice of American pie. For that reason I dislike it!"|Negative
"This is a terrible movie. I hate it more each time i watch. Most comedies can get pretty lame because you know all the gags, and mystery men is no exception. The writing and characterization lack integrity, making watching once again -- as Ben Stiller tears at the hood ornament of the limo, or Hank Azaria says good-bye to Louise Lasser, or Geoffrey Rush flashes his fuhrer choreography, or Tom Waits mumbles while he watches the news report, or Janeane Garofalo refuses a kiss from Paul Reubens -- a chore. This is subpar ensemble acting. The story develops inconsistently, the action sequences are unimaginative and too dominant, and many set-ups fail to payoff by the end. Seriously, if you've seen it and it's been a while, don't bother watching it again, and if you haven't then don't start. You can't watch it again until you've seen it the first time, but that's no loss. (Wes Studi, William H. Macy, the tryouts scene. Too much bad stuff!)"|Negative
"Disappointing, clichéd, derivative, and dull. The vision of this mediocre film is far surpassed by better known "death romances" such as Ghost. While we know intuitively that Peter and June will find ultimate happiness at the end of that long-long stairway, the journey is tedious. The moral of the tale, of course, is trite: love conquers all. And the struggle to achieve that victory is played in a celestial arena of underwhelming vision and lackluster grandeur. With more than 500 unsuitably clad extras portraying various ages and cultures, the directors' vision of heaven remains forgettable six decades later, even in the pre-CGI era.<br /><br />Yet for all the cosmic scale, Powell and Pressburger missed an essential truth: the best story is told at the smallest level. The insufferably sentimental aspect of "Stairway" is captured with ultimate simplicity: June's teardrop, preserved on a rose petal. <br /><br />This film, like the story and the set itself, is one to be forgotten."|Negative
"Yes, many plots are convoluted and hard to follow, and The Bill has an excessive tendency to get violent, which is quite off-putting. It's actually a tedious show that I often find myself skipping. A vast majority of the episodes are dull and predictable, and the acting is subpar, though I do miss Roberta Taylor as Inspector Gina Gold and Todd Carty as Gabriel Kent. I will admit, I prefer the older episodes to the newer episodes, and it is frustrating that the programme is now after the watershed, as I found it easier to watch when it was at 8.00. Ultimately, why I dislike The Bill is because not only is it boring, but the cliffhangers at the end feel forced and don't make the next episode appealing. It is true though, that it is more melodramatic than it was, and I really dislike this programme as it tries too hard not to take itself seriously, resulting in a mess. 3/10 Bethany Cox"|Negative
"the one and only season has just aired here in Australia and i thought it was absolutely terrible! i hate it! all the story lines are so bad! and its an unrealistic view on teen and family life today. yet it still tried to push strong family values of sticking together and being there for each other, which felt forced. their problems were exaggerated, and it really pushed you away from the show. the show is basically about this family called 'the Days' and their lives. the family consisted of Abby Day (mum), Jack Day (dad), Natalie Day (sporty daughter), Cooper Day (outsider son), and Nathan Day (boy genius son). each episodes a day of their life, with coopers perspective on things throughout it. i disliked cooper his insight through out the show was just annoying. he was by far my least favorite character. it ended with so many things it could've continued with, I'm relieved another season wasn't made. it was a terrible show I'm glad it's over."|Negative
"As a person who sought out an existence as a 'professional' person with income backed by a BS in Chemistry and MS in Business Management, my sanity was always spasmodically sustained in outside indulgences in things more artistic. My post-post graduate classes were always emotionally and spiritually supported by an interest in photography, stained-glass, ceramics, metal forging/welding, and art drawing that also included silk screening.<br /><br />I also keep healthy with jogging, walking and lately, hiking to remote destinations in California and nearby states like Utah, Arizona, and Nevada. Jogging, walking and hiking gets one close to the earth with time to stop and watch and listen and also photograph or record sounds.<br /><br />Within that background, I was deeply disappointed by RIVERS AND TIDES. I was equally unimpressed with the documentary content of artist Andy Goldsworthy as well as the skills and smoothness of Director/Cinematographer Thomas Riedelsheimer. I actually could not separate the mediocrity of Goldsworthy's art with the uninspired camera work of Riedelsheimer.<br /><br />Terrible. Terrible. Terrible."|Negative
"After mistaking a Halloween re-broadcast of Orson Welles' classic radio adaptation of WAR OF THE WORLDS for a real Martian invasion, a group of moronic Martians shows up on Earth looking to conquer only their plans go awry as they find themselves truly out of their element and in reality all alone.<br /><br />This really is often quite disappointing and unfunny, with some mediocre lines (just check the memorable quotes) that fall flat. It will most likely appeal only to die-hard Sci-Fi fans. This has failed the test of time for me as seeing it again recently it proved much worse than I expected it to be. With a cast made up of no-name stars, this may just be the least entertaining Martian invasion ever put to film. Interestingly enough, the Martians themselves seem to represent almost every classic Action Hero/Sci-Fi Hero stereotype there is (cool 50s teen, fighter pilot, fearless astronaut, brave soldier and kooky scientist), but it doesn't add much to the film. A bore for the whole family. <br /><br />"Prepare to DIE! Earth Scum!""|Negative
"OK, this movie is terrible. I mean that in a bad way though. It was terrible on purpose, and was one of the worst 'stupid' movies I've seen. The jokes and gags are purposefully bad, and delivered in a way that it struck all the wrong notes with me. The supporting characters were pretty shallow and mediocre. There is a pretty weak plot, and it doesn't work at all.<br /><br />Elvira's character is the focus here, unfortunately. She is annoying and irritating. Cassandra Petersen has little acting talent that just flops in this movie. On top of that lack of acting talent, she had physical attributes which were frankly, overhyped. Few men would agree with that. The parts that show off her figure were also some of the most cringe-worthy scenes in the movie.<br /><br />I had a frown from ear to ear from the first scene to the last.<br /><br />Highly recommended to avoid for fans of comedy, and for fans of beautiful women. I'm glad they didn't make a dozen more Elvia movies."|Negative
"I grew up with H.R. Pufnstuff and the dashingly talented Jack Wild and now my daughters are unimpressed fans of Jack Wild too. This movie is exactly what movies shouldn't be: dull and unengaging. This movie is not suitable for children or adults. A lot of the dialogue is poorly directed and Witchiepoo's performance is something you want to miss. The music in this movie failed to suit Jack Wild and Mama Cass. And as a Jack Wild critic, I would never want the chance to watch him dance or hear him sing. Knowing the hard life that Jack had now makes this movie even more disappointing especially when he sings the opening song "If I Could". It makes me pause in frustration for him for giving me unpleasant childhood memories that I am now regrettably passing on to my children. Let's avoid Living Island where there is boredom and tedium! And let Jack Wild's memory fade by not passing Pufnstuff on to others."|Negative
"Was flipping around the TV and HBO was showing a double whammy of unbelievably horrendous medical conditions, so I turned to my twin sister and said, "Hey this looks awful," - truly I hate documentaries - so we reluctantly started watching it. At first I thought Jonni Kennedy was a young man, but then it was explained that due to his condition, he never went through puberty, thus the high voice and smaller body. He was on a crusade to raise money for his cause. He had an irritating sense of humor combined with an uncomfortable sense of spirituality... I cringed, watched some more, groaned, got up to get another drink, then cringed some more. Once Jonni Kennedy's "time was up" he flew to heaven to be with the angels. He was more than ready; he had learned his lessons from this life and he was free. I strongly advise against watching this. If you do fall in love with this guy, you have questionable taste."|Negative
"Cuban Blood is one of those disappointing films that has little to say about life despite its traditional approach. I actually watched it while sailing around Cuba on a western Caribbean cruise. It details the life of an 11 year old boy in a small town in Cuba in 1958 and 1959 during the revolution. Not much time is spent on the revolution until the very end, when the Socialist regime came and took the property of the boy's father. The majority of the film is the boy's coming of age and the relationships that arise in a small town where everyone knows everyone else. There are some weak scenes that fail to resonate. A mediocre film with subpar acting and directing. This is a film that tells a story with no special effects or grand schemes or real twists. It is a film about people and their lives, their mistakes, and their triumphs. A forgettable film not worth watching again."|Negative
"I'm thrilled they chose to release this film to introduce the American audience to the dynamo that is Jet Li. While Fist of Legend might have been another option, Black Mask is an excellent choice. The film is thoroughly entertaining and offers a great showcase of Li's talents. The final fight sequence is particularly well staged by Yuen Woo Ping who went on to coordinate The Matrix. The English release benefits from dynamic editing and dubbing, though I still hope Hollywood studios will also release these films uncut with subtitles for purists. Jet Li shows his characteristic charisma in the title role and Francoise Yip has a cool but brief role as the female 701.<br /><br />Black Mask has a unique goth style that adds significant interest, and it's perfectly balanced with exciting gun battles and explosions. The focus on Li's fantastic physical skills is just right. Black Mask is an excellent film that really shows Li's skills, though fans might also enjoy checking out Fist of Legend for a different perspective on his abilities."|Negative
"Has Al Pacino ever been in a good movie? His name seems to be a warning sign for subpar cinema. This is as poor a performance as he's ever given. Pacino is an American embarrassment. And this is a political thriller as bad as they get. There are no good guys and no bad guys. But the system has its inexorable effect on the people who think they're running it. Not only is Pacino's performance unbearable --- the eulogy at the dead child's funeral is awfully cringeworthy --- the film has a slow, artificial feel to it that undermines the performances by resorting to gimmicks. This disappointing portrait of big city politics also manages to provide two hours of tedious movie watching without any redeeming qualities. There is murder. There are bad people. But they come across ineffectively, crossing the line. A film like this destroys my already jaded faith in Hollywood. I don't award many zeros. This one richly deserves it!"|Negative
A very unrealistic portrait of a broken family and the effect it has on the kid caught in between. As a child of divorced parents I couldn't relate to events in the film at all. Also - a really cliché zombie twist which I thought was VERY UNORIGINAL. I'm tired of the same old stuff in movies, and this film just adds to it.

"My least favorite Jackie Chan movie will always be "Drunken Master" (1978), followed by this disappointing film from 1985, "Police Story." In it, Chan plays a Hong Kong super-cop who busts a notorious crime lord and his gang, and is then assigned to protect the man's girlfriend (Brigitte Lin) so that she can turn state's evidence. As the story goes on, the gangster sends his goons to dispatch Lin, but Chan takes matters into his own fists and feet, while keeping girlfriend Maggie Cheung at bay. Like "Drunken Master," "Police Story" has many of the signature stunts and over-the-top martial arts/action choreography that Chan has become famous for, climaxing in a lackluster battle royal at a crowded shopping mall. In his role as director, Chan falls short, giving a mediocre and unfunny performance that detracts from the action. While light on the overall slapstick humor of "Drunken Master," at heart "Police Story" is just that, a police story, a generic cop-thriller that would be rightfully forgotten over the years to come.<br /><br />2/10"|Negative
"I'm a 53 year-old college professor. I went with my wife and 12 year old daughter. We all found the movie disappointing. The film is unoriginal, dull, slow-paced and utterly charmless. The plot was too simple for a 10 year old to find engaging, and too predictable to keep an adult interested. I thought Emma Roberts did a poor job and the rest of the cast was equally underwhelming. My main criticism is that the Los Angeles sets were not as interesting as they should have been. They were functional, but nothing stood out. Similarly, make-up, costume, lighting, cinematography, editing and directing were mediocre at best. Altogether, I thought it was a completely forgettable experience. I am surprised that the professional critics (almost all adult males) praised the film. Apparently, they have a bias towards films that portray young women in stereotypical roles. Their writings reveal more about their own outdated views than anything about this disappointing family film. I cannot recommend it to children or parents."|Negative
"Sensual but unimpressive Maria Braun. (Hanna Schygula) marries a soldier in the middle of World War II and spends a half of day and the whole night with him. That's how long her marriage lasts before she loses him to the war and then to prison. She carries on with her life, becomes a businesswoman being sensual but lacking in intelligence and relying too heavily on sex whenever or wherever necessary: "I don't know a thing about business, but I do know what German women want. You might even say I'm an expert on it". While struggling to achieve success she always remembers her husband, Hermann (her man) and delusionally convinces herself that whatever she does is for him, for their future happy life together. "Maria Braun"'s style is a poor imitation of melodramas by Fassbinder's favorite Hollywood director, Douglas Sirk and fails to offer a meaningful glimpse of the loss and survival in postwar Germany. Hanna Schygula is lackluster in every scene of the movie and her performance is disappointing.<br /><br />4.5/10"|Negative
"This is one of the weaker classic Edgar Wallace movies from the German series - it features all the basic ingredients for a disappointing Wallace crime flic movie from the 60ies: Although his majesty, Mr. Kinski, is missing you still have young Joachim 'Blacky' Fuchsberger, starring once again as the typical clichéd American 'womanizer', you have young Eddi Arendt in his most (and just as well typical) annoying role ever - the tired, stereotypical British butler - and you have (not so young anymore) Lowitz as the dull yet very 'dry' ironic (and thus: hardly entertaining) police investigator. Furthermore you'll get subjected to a ridiculous and very campy 'evil guy' behind a frog mask (hence the movie's title!), you'll get a grating swinging soundtrack, poorly executed b-movie action scenes, partly filmed out off the wildest perspectives (which doesn't excuse the poor quality!), unconvincing scream queens, and on and on... All those ingredients get thrown together in a bland cocktail of pure German Edgar Wallace tedium - highly disappointing!"|Negative
"I wouldn't call "We're Back! A Dinosaur's Story" simply a kiddie version of "Jurassic Park". I found it less interesting than that. Like the former, it calls into question the security of bringing beings from one era into ours, but fails to explore this concept meaningfully. It's somewhat impressive to see who provided the voices: John Goodman, Rhea Perlman, Jay Leno, Walter Cronkite, Julia Child, Kenneth Mars, Yeardley Smith, Martin Short and Larry King. To paraphrase that: a given actor, the "Cheers" woman, the "Tonight Show" host, the Most Trusted Name In News, a famous chef, the "Young Frankenstein" police chief, Lisa Simpson, one of the Three Amigos and the CNN guy.<br /><br />But I guess that I shouldn't focus only on the cast, as it doesn't save the movie. I thought that this movie lacked substance for both children (overly simplistic) and adults (superficial treatment of natural history). True, it's escapism, but the shallow kind. I would actually say that John Goodman doing Rex's voice here is a forgettable precursor to his voice work in "Monsters Inc". Not worth seeing."|Negative
"I consider this movie a disappointment, despite watching it 4 or 5 times in an attempt to appreciate it. While it describes a face of WW2 that we don't usually see in Hollywood movies, particularly showing German soldiers, army and the Nazi government more "humanized", this approach fails to resonate. One of the facts that struck me as odd was the mention, by the end of the movie, of a murder that took place in a forest in the last 20's... that forest is the place where the final chapters of Berlin Alexanderplatz take place: those are the woods where Reinhold kills Mieze. Another confusing element for those who like details is the representation of doors. Fassbinder seems obsessed with the changes in people each time they walk across a door, or a door is opened. Many doors are shown on the screen, opened and closed. And the characters change in their personality, their acts, etc any time that happens. But this device feels forced and unconvincing. Did anyone else find this as distracting as I did?"|Negative
"This is one military drama I dislike a lot! Tom Berenger plays military assassin Thomas Beckett. This Marine is no-nonsense, in your face, and no questions asked kind of person who gets the job done, but it's not compelling. There you have Billy Zane("The Phantom" and others) who plays Richard Miller, a former SWAT form D.C., works for the government and takes orders only from them. Who needs a bureaucrat? I don't! When these two are paired, sparks should be flying. And how. However, Beckett's attempts to teach the young bureaucrat on how it works fall flat. When the other sniper hits, it's supposed to be wits vs. wits, cat vs. mouse, gunman vs. gunman, but it's just dull. And when the seasoned sniper is caught, it's up to Miller to put politics aside and save him, which feels contrived. Who needs politics when you a pro like Beckett, he took orders from no one but himself, plays by the rules and not the book, and mutual respect is brought out despite the politics. Unfortunately, none of this makes for an engaging film. The movie was a complete miss. Skip it. Rating 1 out of 5 stars."|Negative
"Solino really disappointed me with its poorly developed characters. While being a simple tale of rivalry between two brothers, it was overly focused on hate and jealousy. What I disliked most about the movie was how I couldn't relate to the feelings Gigi was going through, especially when he had to take his mother back to her home town in Italy and miss out on attending the festival film awards ceremony his film was entered into. To see this character who struggled so hard between his artistic dream and his innate sense of duty to his mother was so uninteresting. Even at the end when he makes one more attempt to reach out to his father was so cliché. And as in poorly written stories, most fathers are caricatures who never get past their walls to reach out to their children. I couldn't even identify with Giancarlo, the brother, who while being the more self assured and elder brother, had so many underdeveloped insecurities. A really disappointing film that failed to make me laugh or cry."|Negative
"It's really unfortunate that most people outside of Canada think that the only things that Canada produces are snow, mounties and hockey players. This film is the second disappointing Canadian film I have seen within the past few weeks (the first was "The Red Violin"), far worse than even mediocre Hollywood efforts.<br /><br />Gustad Noble is anything but that; he is a middle-aged Parsi bank employee in Bombay in the 1970s. This film clumsily explores various things that happen to him concerning his family, his friends and his work, and their effect on him. At the same time, it is a dull, and, I would assume, inaccurate, portrayal of middle-class, urban life in India at the time.<br /><br />However, I was somewhat prepared for this, having read Rohinton Mistry's book a few years ago. The film, as might be expected, fails to capture even the basic elements of the book, and, if you want to avoid a really bad book and an even worse film, skip both the book and film "Such a Long Journey".|Negative
"I've never liked this John Frankenheimer film. Poor script by Elmore Leonard and the main reason this wasn't just another thriller is because of Frankenheimer's failures. His loose direction and inattention to little details make all the difference, even hiring porn star Ron Jeremy as a consultant was a mistake! You can make a case that it's the last bad film Roy Scheider made. I've always said that Robert Trebor gave just a terrible performance. Clarence Williams III got all the publicity with his over-the-top performance and he's mediocre at best, but I really thought Trebor stood out for all the wrong reasons. Frankenheimer may be ashamed of this film compared to others, and rightly so as it is an ineffective thriller full of contrived blackmail, unconvincing murder, gratuitous sex, drugs, and real porno actors appear in unnecessary sleazy parts. What can you say about a film that has Ann Margaret being shot up with drugs and raped? A guilty displeasure to say the least. Vanity has a pointlessly sleazy role and a very young Kelly Preston makes an early appearance she'd probably rather forget. A classic example of exploitive thriller that should be forgotten."|Negative
"This disappointing Marvel superhero game fails to pay proper tribute by straying from the comics. Of all the Marvel superhero games that have been so lame with weak graphics and gameplay, Spiderman sadly continues this trend in both departments. It does feature the voice of Stan Lee, the creator of Spiderman comics, but that's not enough to save it.<br /><br />As you'd expect Spiderman does whatever a spider can. He does more than spin webs. In fact, he uses them as weapons and shields. When he's not using web in combat, he punches and kicks as well. Spidey has his hands full as he battles Venom, Rhino, Mysterio, Scorpion, and Dr. Octopus to name a few. Look for Captain America in a cameo.<br /><br />Most of the levels are frustratingly difficult, and some of them require excessive patience to beat. The main complaint about this game is that it's so short and can be completed in less than three hours, leaving players feeling cheated. If you're a real Marvel superhero fan, this game will likely disappoint you with its lack of long gameplay. Don't expect much improvement in "Spiderman 2." My evaluation: 3 out of 10."|Negative
"Jacknife is a disappointment of the 80's. It's a movie that struggles despite decent acting and an uninteresting directing touch. In Jacknife both lovers of European and American cinema may find little to relate to. The screenplay is dull and filled with underdeveloped characters. Ed Harris gives a mediocre performance. He portrays his alcoholic hero unconvincingly, failing to make us feel his broken heart in each line and move. Robert De Niro makes us once again question his status as one of the greatest actors of all time in one of the blandest and least realistic performances of his career. Jacknife often becomes boring as it shows its heroes devoid of any compelling character elements. After the war none is a hero. Everybody is a loser, and this movie fails to convey that simple truth effectively. None can mend up his pieces after a war, just like the heroes of this movie. Jacknife attempts to be about the diseases of the soul that war creates, but falls short. Simply disappointing movie."|Negative
"This oddity from Roman Polanski fails to deliver on its potential. Polanski himself plays a timid man who rents a Parisian apartment where the previous tenant committed suicide. He becomes obsessed with discovering what led her to it, to the point that he's dressing in drag and reenacting events the way they might have unfolded. The movie's unsettling to a point, but lacks the atmosphere of creepy dread that Polanski usually excels at, and it comes off as a poor imitation of "Rosemary's Baby" and "Repulsion," two other Polanski films that deal with the eerie goings on in moody apartments far more effectively.<br /><br />But as for the preoccupation....unless I'm reading too much into the film, I have to believe that this was Polanksi's reaction to the feelings of persecution he felt at being labeled a sexual pervert and exiled from America. Not making a judgement about him one way or the other myself, but it's hard to deny the evidence of that in the movie itself.<br /><br />Grade: C-"|Negative
"What a disappointing and disheartening television movie. The story tells of a little five year old girl who has lost her daddy and finds it impossible to cope. Her mother is also very distressed ..only a miracle can alleviate their unhappiness. Which all viewers hope will materialise, but it never does. Samantha Mathis is unconvincing as the little girl's mum, unlike her role as the nanny in "Jack and Sarah". Not worth watching if you like both Samantha Mathis and happy, tear jerking movies! Ellen Burstyn is, as always, a forgettable grandmother in this poorly acted movie. Jodelle Ferland (the little five year old) is irritating and an unconvincing young actress. The film is based on a true story which makes it even more frustrating. "Mermaid" is a failed attempt to showcase the milk of human kindness which is clearly illustrated to be lacking in this difficult world we live in. "Mermaid" leaves us all hopeless, by realizing that there aren't many lovely people in the world with lots of love to give. James Robson Glasgow Scotland U.K."|Negative
"Paul Verhoeven's De Vierde Man (The Fourth Man) is one of the least compelling thrillers I have ever seen. It really was a disappointment. The story concerns bi-sexual writer Gerard (Jeroen Krabbe), as he is lured into a relationship with beautiful hairdresser Christine (Renée Soutendijk), but in the twisted mind of Gerard there could be more to the story. Verhoeven and cinematographer Jan De Bont create a confusing and off-putting atmosphere full of surreal and sickening sexual imagery, this really pushes you away from the story, you want to turn it off, but you feel obligated to continue. This is by far Verhoeven's worst film (maybe second only to Robocop). True The Fourth Man isn't for everyone, some of the sex scenes are quite gratuitous (just ignore them, but trust me, even if you watch for at least ten minutes you'll be repelled. This is one of those films that you don't care how it ends, a failed whodunit in the Hitchcock tradition, boring, controversial and tedious. I even dislike the spider metaphor.<br /><br /> 2/10"|Negative
"Thanks to Warner Archive, I can once again see this mammoth variety show which throws in everything but the kitchen sink. (The bathtub, however is present.) This film gives screen time to every person who was under contract to Warners at the time. If some of the artists seem unfamiliar to some, it is because they were big in the silent days, and most faded with the popularity of the talkies. There are some truly unremarkable artists from the vaudeville era as well. You will be most unimpressed with Winnie Lightner, who performs two lackluster numbers. Also there is that French star, Irene Bordoni who croons a love song in an awkward manner. Perhaps one of the biggest disappointments is the two-strip Technicolor "Chinese Fantasy," which has been restored for this version. It is truly underwhelming and it stars Myrna Loy and Nick Lucas. Finally, there is the massive "Lady Luck" finale which drags on for nearly a quarter of an hour. This is truly a misstep of the early-talkie era. Any old-movie buff will find this tedious."|Negative
"*What I Like About SPOILERS* Teenager Holly Tyler (Amanda Bynes) goes to live with older sister Valerie (Jennie Garth) to avoid moving to Japan with her father; but she doesn't know the half of the wacky things that will happen to her from now on, and not only to her, but to her sister, her friends Gary (Wesley Jonathan) and Tina (Alison Munn), boyfriend Henry (Michael McMillian), crush Vince (Nick Zano), Valerie's boyfriend Jeff (Simon Rex), first boss (then firefighter then husband) Vic (Dan Cortese), annoying colleague Lauren (Leslie Grossman) and second boss Peter (?) If you don't have a tolerance for childish humor, please skip this; if you like only veeeery sophisticated comedy this is definitely not for you; if you can't stand a silly, sometimes cringeworthy show with two overacting chicks in the lead (and none other than the irritating 'Mary Cherry' from Popular - Leslie Grossman - in the main cast), then what the hell are you waiting for?

"Disappointing pirate entertainment. It lacks the ingredients to keep one's attention -- a tedious tale of intrigue, an unconvincing lady pirate named Spitfire Stevens (Maureen O'Hara) who's awkwardly paired with the uninspiring Mr. Hawke (Errol Flynn) who is out on a secret mission of his own. They make an unconvincing romantic pair onscreen -- yawn!<br /><br />Anthony Quinn is the mean, bad pirate weaving his villainous web of divide and conquer. I noticed the very familiar face of Mildred Natwick playing a supporting role as Mrs. MacGregor, the protector of young Princess Patma (Alice Kelley).<br /><br />There is beautifully filmed scenery of shorelines, ships, and the bay. However, the action scenes of sword fighting clashes, ship battles, and daring leaps of Errol Flynn (Robin Hood on board ship!) feel forced and unexciting. From the flaming redhead herself I once heard in an interview of Maureen O'Hara that she boasted great command of the bullwhip and could also outdo Flynn in sword fighting in those days but there'd be no need to put it to the test here.<br /><br />Barely watchable movie."|Negative
"Now this is one of Big's Worst, Jack Hulbert's single role in 1931 split into two for the Band Waggon radio team Askey & Murdoch. It suffers from a lackluster cast, who overact to the point of annoyance, especially Askey of course. Poor performances were provided by Linden Travers, melodramatics by Herbert Lomas, and pragmatics by Richard Murdoch.<br /><br />The group of rail passengers stranded at the lonely country station for the night find more than they bargained for, ghostly trains, spectral porters, hairy sausage rolls and Arthur trying to entertain them all. His repartee with everyone falls between cringe-worthy and ghastly dull. When the formula works it's barely passable, but it mostly gets very contrived and forced making the film seem even more dated than it is. And those damn treacherous fifth columnists - thank any God Britain hasn't got any nowadays!<br /><br />Ultimately a tedious and irritating film, to dread seeing back on the TV screen as an unwelcome guest, and if you were expecting to be shivered out of your timbers you'll definitely be very disappointed!"|Negative
"I first saw this movie when I was a freshman in high school, and the film has unfortunately stuck with me through the years. It's not about the soundtrack, or cinematography, or even the dialogue and somewhat bad acting, it's about the misguided educational purpose, and the flawed message behind that is the most problematic. It incorrectly suggests that it's a sin to have a child when you're a teenager and still in high school, and that it's always a bad thing, which is an oversimplification. Tons of girls I knew are all having children now, and I guess they never watched this misleading movie, and if they did, they wisely didn't get the message behind it all. It's about fearmongering when you're in a sexual relationship. While it's true that any girl can get pregnant the first time, the movie exaggerates the consequences. You don't necessarily lose out on your dreams, but the film wrongly implies that they always have to take a backseat in your future because you have a child to think about first.<br /><br />This movie has a clear but misguided message behind it: JUST SAY NO! Which is an overly simplistic approach to a complex issue."|Negative
"Insisting that Martin Luther King's inspirational spirit resides not just in American civil liberties but inside the hearts and minds of people everywhere, Danish helmer Niels Arden Oplev attempts to transplant this belief to a 1969 Danish middle school, but falls short. More specifically, it fails to work its way into the crusade of a young boy named Frits (Janus Dissing Rathke) against his oppressively rigid and churlishly abusive headmaster Svendsen (Bent Mejding). Adapted from a true story, the performances are executed with a lack of conviction and a confusing approach to its varied characters keeps it disengaging. A battle of ideologies between a 13 year-old and a demented disciplinarian gives way to forced humour and awkward shifts in mood disorients, despite attempting to keep it shrewdly cynical in the same vein as a "Dead Poets Society" more than a "Matilda". It treads a familiar path but a continued and precise service to its young protagonist including a personal subplot that rounds off Frits as a young boy becoming a young man, fails to raise the film above mediocrity, resulting in a tiresome family film that misses the mark."|Negative
"Of course if you are reading my review you have seen this film already. 'Raja Babu' is one of my least favorite characters. I can't stand the concept of a spoiled brat with a 24*7 servant on his motorcycle. Watch movies and emulate characters etc etc. I hate the scene when a stone cracks in Kader khans mouth while eating. Also where Shakti Kapoor narrates a corny story of Raja Babu's affairs on a dinner table and Govinda wearing 'dharam-veer' uniform makes sentimental remarks. That's my least favorite scene of the film. 'Achcha Pitaji To Main Chalta Hoon' scene is just a poor attempt at chemistry between two Indian actors doing a comical scene with no dialogs. It's terrible. It's a cat mouse film. Just watch these actors failing to help each other and still trying to take away the scene from each other. It's totally unenjoyable. If you dislike Govinda and Kader Khan chemistry then it's a must-avoid. I think RB is last in my list by David Dhawan. 'Deewana Mastana', 'Ankhein','Shola or Shabnam', 'Swarg', Coolie no 1' are all better than this mess of a film. 3/10."|Negative
"2 WORDS: Razzie Award. Nuff said. This film had nothing in it. Failed comedy that didn't make me laugh, weak drama that didn't move me, and one of the worst dance scenes to rival Breakin 2: Electric Boogaloo. The acting was bottom of the barrel for any independent film. Jeremy Earl was in poor form, worse than his stint on the Joan Cusack Show. His lines were executed with sloppy imprecision and dull wit reminiscent of a very old Jimmy Walker. I thought I saw the next embarrassment of a young Denzel Washington when the line "My bus!! It's.... Gone" That was the true low point of the movie. My Grandmother hated it sooo much that i warned her friends not to watch it. It will bring boredom to your eyes and indifference to your heart as you see the white Tony Donato and African American Nathan Davis fail to bond. Through thick( being held up at knife point) and thin( Nathan giving Tony tips on women) the new dysfunctional duo has arrived and are out to ruin Hollywood."|Negative
"I hate this movie and have regretted seeing it quite a few times over the years. It only gets worse with every viewing. I disagree with all of the positive reviews here. Yes, it's gritty and brutally realistic as life on the prairie was in those days, but that doesn't make it enjoyable. I found myself complaining as I watched it. Someone on here said Rip Torn was miscast, and I couldn't agree more. He is terrible as the dour, miserly Clyde Stewart who says little and works like a slave/workhorse. Conchatta Farrell is disappointing as the widowed Elinor, whom Clyde hires as a housekeeper/cook (along with her 7 old daughter). Lilia Skala is mediocre as distant neighbor called grandma. Even the stark Montana prairie fails to impress. It is just brutal country in which to settle. There are some scenes that are repulsive and unnecessary. No special effects here, what you see is real, but that's not always a good thing! It even has a terribly mismatched music score and a poor script. Once you see Heartland, you'll wish you could forget it. It deserves all the 1s it gets here."|Negative
"I took this out arbitrarily from the library the other night, having no idea of the film's cult, influence, or that it is currently being staged as a musical.(!) Most of the comments here are off base, it's dull, unfunny, and yes, extremely exploitive despite the supposed good intentions of the filmmakers. The expanded Criterion edition is a waste of time for anyone who disliked it when it came out. <br /><br />I think you can also see in little Edie the fall of a class that sort of disappeared, you can hear it in old films of Jackie O too; people just don't talk like that anymore. I think as a documentary, it would have been interesting to get more information about how the home fell into disrepute, Old Edie at least still seems aware of what's going on to a certain degree; couldn't She see the once spectacular home disintegrating? <br /><br />Yet the film's subject is the life the two women have constructed for themselves now, a real life Tennessee Williams one act. Not worth your time."|Negative
"I became a fan of the TV series `Homicide: Life on the Street' late in the show's run, but quickly grew disillusioned. It was a cop show that tried too hard to be different: its use of hand-held cameras was disorienting, taking the viewer everywhere unnecessarily, with its multiethnic and mutiracial cast feeling forced and their personalities often grating. It covered all of the good and bad of a police department, but seemed to dwell too much on the corruption and personality clashes. <br /><br />Homicide: The Movie, the reunion follow-up to the series, is as disappointing as a made-for-television film can be. After Lt. Giardello (Yaphet Kotto), now a candidate for mayor of Baltimore, is shot, the series' cast members are back to help find the killer, but their performances feel lackluster. The cast members who left the force and those who died also manage to have their place in the film, which feels contrived. The intensity and fire that marked the series are missing, and the script lacks the spark that once defined the show. All in all, a mediocre TV movie.<br /><br />Vote: 4"|Negative
"The film maybe goes too far, and even if you love the show it's not what you expect. It's a bad movie; it's actually pretty disappointing. Even if you like the show, don't see the movie. It starts off slow and never really picks up, turning out to be pretty unfunny. There are a few attempted "heart-wrenching" scenes toward the end, but after all the protagonists have gone through, these scenes fall flat. Also Jerry throws in his opinion why his show upsets people and tries to justify his show's existence, but he doesn't make a good point. We care so much about the private details of celebrities lives, so why is it wrong that these people tell their private lives on national TV, too. If they were celebrities we wouldn't mind at all, we'd eat it up. Do we not like his guest doing this just because they're poor white trash and it reminds us that there really is poverty in this world and not just rich glamous movie stars living in a "Leave it to Beaver" world?"|Negative
"To all the satisfied people who have praised the dialogue, the budget, the this and the that....who wants to hear it? IF you understood the point of this overhyped movie, that's your problem. The rest of us who deeply hate this movie do not care what you think. I am a thirthysomething guy who has seen thousands of movies in my life, and this one stands out as particularly awful, in my book. It was not supposed to be a documentary, or a completely factual account of what happened that night. It is the most cliché love story ever attempted. I know that it is the cynical 90's and the millennium has everyone in a tizzy, but come on. Someone on this comments board praised that it made too much money! How ridiculous is that? It made bundles of money in every civilized country on the planet, and is the top grossing film in the planet. I will gladly oppose the majority this time around. Okay, fans, time to face reality, I am done."|Negative
"Without doubt the worst adaptation of the novels of John Le Carre, disappointingly transformed into a mediocre film. Performances by Peter Egan (Magnus Pym, The Perfect Spy), Rudiger Weigang (Axel, real name Alexander Hampel, Magnus' Czech Intelligence controller), Ray McAnally (Magnus' con-man father) and Alan Howard (Jack Brotherhood, Magnus' mentor, believer and British controller), together with the rest of the characters, are so unconvincing and forced, the person responsible for casting them should have been fired. Even the small parts, such as Major Membury, are performed poorly. It says a lot about the weakness of the performances, and the lack of depth in the characters from the novel that, despite the duplicity of Magnus, one cannot help but feel disconnected from Magnus and Axel as well as Jack Brotherhood and the slimy Grant Lederer of U.S. Intelligence. I have read the book once, and watched the movie once, and continue to be underwhelmed by both. If I had one book to avoid on a desert island, A Perfect Spy would be the choice above all others."|Negative
"I found the one and only comment about this movie entirely accurate and not harsh enough, so I have decided to write my own. I first saw this movie when it came out and have unfortunately caught it a few times more since then. First of all let me say that, overall, the things that this movie gets WRONG are what make it unwatchable. It doesn't matter that it has some decent aspects, the faults are too glaring to ignore. It is not worth watching. The idea of basing a movie on Walt Whitman's visit a restrictive, narrow-minded Anglo-Canadian community in Southern Ontario and bringing people to life is a misguided mis-en-scene. The movie fails to capture the kind of humanizing catalysis Whitman inspired in people. And in that sense it is entirely inaccurate. The acting - especially by Rip Torn (Whitman) and Colm Feore as the doctor - is disappointing. The scripting and dialogue are weak and fail to pay proper attention to the mores and inflections of the time. Overall, what's to like? Besides, this film brings Whitman to life so poorly, I'd rather watch any other portrayal."|Negative
"My son was 7 years old when he saw this movie, he is now on a Russian Fishing vessel and said that the movie he was most disappointed with and that has haunted his mind all of these 39 years is the movie of The Legend of the Boy and the Eagle. He has asked if it were possible for me to avoid getting this for him. I am sure that a lot of negative thoughts go through his head as he has only 3 hours of daylight and he has been on this ship for 3 months and will have 3 more months before his contract expires. Despite our Indian blood, he feels disconnected from this movie. On January 27th he will turn 47 years old and I would like to be able to find a better movie for him. He lives in Thailand and has been a commercial fisherman for the past 17 years and as we all know this is one of the most dangerous jobs. Can you help me find a different, more uplifting movie?

"Plato's run is a disappointing b movie with Gary Busey. It is a fairly unknown film so when i saw it at a car boot i thought this looks entertaining but i was wrong. Gary Busey plays Plato smith a tough mercenary who is framed for the assassination of a powerful Cuban crime lord now on the run Plato must survive long enough to prove his innocence with the help of his friends played by Steve Bauer (scarface) and action star Jeff Speaksman (the expert). What i disliked about Plato's run was the way the film quickly got boring the plot may have been done before and it was still bad the acting was painful to watch and the action was quite dull as well especially the climax Gary Busey makes a poor hero ironic since he normally plays the bad guy and Steve Bauer is mediocre as Plato's sidekick even Jeff Speaksman makes a bad performance and he cant even act well to finish it of Plato's run is an unenjoyable effort from nu image films and i give it 3 out of 10"|Negative
"I know many people have a special fondness for the Alistair Sim version of Dickens' story, and unfortunately, this 1984 version fails to measure up. My wife and I own a copy of this film on VHS, and we've tried watching it together every Christmas Eve, but it's become a chore. I often remark that we could watch it on Halloween too, because it's an unpleasantly creepy ghost story.<br /><br />Scott--typecast as Scrooge--is excessively mean and nasty, making his transformation feel unconvincing and forced. It's a far cry from his performance in Patton. The spirits are all ineffective, each one more ridiculous than the last. Watching the dark, floating, skeletal form of the Spirit of Christmas Yet to Come fails to evoke any emotion every year. And what a waste of a supporting cast! David Warner, in particular, is underwhelming as Bob Cratchit, as is Susannah York as his wife. <br /><br />I seem to recall that this version deviates significantly from the original story compared to most others--but I may be mistaken, as it's been several years since I read it. Regardless, this is a disappointing Christmas film."|Negative
"I generally find Loretta Young hard to take, too concerned with her looks and too ladylike in all the wrong ways. In this underwhelming Frank Borzage romance, she's playing a low-self-esteem patsy who puts up with entirely too much bullying from paramour Spencer Tracy, and she's unconvincing and resistible. It's an odd little movie, played mostly in a one-room shack in a Hooverville, unusually up-front about the Depression yet attempting to be romantic and idealized. Tracy, playing a blustery, hard-to-take "regular guy" who would be an awful chauvinist and bully by today's standards, fails to soften his character's hard edge and remains thoroughly unappealing. There's mediocre supporting work from Marjorie Rambeau and Glenda Farrell (who never got as far as she should have), and Jo Swerling's screenplay is modest but ineffective. The real disappointments are Borzage, who always liked to dramatize true love in lyrical close-up but fails to do so here, and Young. You want to slap her and tell her character to wise up, she's too good for this guy, but she's so wooden and unpersuasive, you impatiently watch their story play out to an unsatisfying conclusion."|Negative
"Poorly cast, terrible script full of holes, hot blonde gets eaten alive, The evil scientist has a seriously nasty mustache, one man takes on a platoon of trained gunman and comes out victor, terrible special effects, they fix the problem by blowing the head off the monster... Awful. The only thing missing was an unnecessary graphic sex scene during one of the killings. Ugh. Bad gored up mess filled with predictable twists and laughable one liners. I strongly disliked this movie, and before you watch it make sure you're prepared for a frustrating experience. I recommend avoiding this movie unless you can watch a movie and not take it seriously. I can not, in my right mind, think that this movie was made for people to enjoy. Even if you can watch it and sit back without expectations, I really think you'll struggle to find any redeeming qualities in this movie. Very disappointing. So save your popcorn and beer for a better movie with friends. It brought nothing but annoyance into my life."|Negative
"I got a free pass to a preview of this movie last night and didn't know what to expect. The premise seemed silly and I assumed it would be a lot of shallow make-fun-of-the-virgin humor. Unfortunately, that's exactly what it was. I barely chuckled throughout the entire film. This movie is a must-avoid for anyone with an open mind and a slightly twisted sense of humor. OK.....this is not a movie to go to with your grandmother (Jack Palance?) or small children. The language is filthy, the jokes are (very) crude, and the sex talk is about as graphic as you'll find anywhere. What's disappointing, however, is that the movie fails to be a sweet love story. My girlfriend and I both hated it. Steve Carell is terrible, and (like The Office) the supporting cast really makes the film worse. All of the characters have their flaws, and they lack depth and likability. No one pulls their weight and the chemistry is awful. I can't wait to forget about this movie. I'm sure it will be up there with the worst films for avoiding replays and cringeworthy lines."|Negative
"Criticized when it came out, this film now looks dated and sounds mediocre. A showcase of overacting, from Gielgud, Kenneth Haigh, Harry Andrews and especially Anton Walbrook, and a flat central performance from the wooden and inexperienced Jean Seberg. Preminger's long slow takes are tedious and make you lose interest, and Graham Greene's script condenses Shaw at the cost of complexity. The piece has the look of a cheap made for TV movie, and is overly studio bound to its detriment. Too many contemporary movies on 'historical' themes cannot resist dumbing down, and this is no exception. What would Mel Gibson have made of the Maid? Probably something more engaging than this. Preminger's lack of visual flair makes the movie dull. There are a few decent performances, but not enough to save the film. I caught this movie on TV and was expecting to turn it off quickly, which I did. In our age of religious fundamentalism and sacrifice, Joan's story could have resonance, but this adaptation fails to capture it."|Negative
I was totally disengaged from this film from the first to last minute. It is poorly shot, with uninteresting and cliched camera angles and techniques employed. The plot surrounds a deaf woman who is picked on by friends and colleagues alike. She hires an assistant at work, with her true intention being to find love. He's an ex-con and she takes advantage of him to wreak revenge on those who have hurt her. In return she must help him with a heist that requires her lip reading skills to pull it off. The film devolves into a dull film noir, with a couple of truly terrible scenes, and an even worse finale. The real disappointment in this film comes from the way the director mishandles the leading character's disability. The use of sound fails to create tension, and the dramatic shifts from silence to noise are jarring and ineffective. Throw in some forced black comedy and awkward undertones of erotic sexual repression and you've got the makings of a mediocre film. It's the sort of film Hollywood tries to make but shouldn't.|Negative
"I watched 'Speak Easily' one night and thought it was terrible, lacking everything. Buster Keaton strangely speaking was off-putting, and the labored line delivery of a leading lady was unbearable. The next day I kept thinking about the movie, though. I couldn't get Durante's awful song out of my head, I kept trying to forget Thelma Todd's first scene, I considered that Keaton's falls and physical comedy were forced and unfunny. The next night I reluctantly watched a scene with Thelma Todd as a conniving chorus girl trying to impress Buster and Jimmy with her sex appeal. A very cringe-worthy scene, the actors terrible, their faces, their eyes, their silly expressions all overdone. So I painfully watched another scene, their show is opening on Broadway. Buster's blissful innocence ruins every act. Again, I was groaning out loud, disappointed by Keaton's clowning and tumbling. So the next night I watched the whole movie again, and this time I see it for what it truly is: It's Awful! It's Terrible! It's Unbearable! Three mediocre comedians! Todd stumbles! Durante screeches! Keaton speaks poorly! It ain't just imperfect...there's hardly a laugh in this picture."|Negative
"I saw this film about twenty years ago on the late show. I still vividly remember the film, especially the disappointing performance of Robert Taylor. I always thought Taylor was overrated as an actor as most critics saw him as solid, almost dull leading man type, and women simply loved to watch his films because of his looks. This film, however, proved how limited an actor he could be. He got too many roles like this during his long career. This is his worst performance. He is totally unbelievable in a truly villainous role. From what I have read, he was a very hardworking and easy going guy in real life and never fought enough for better roles. He basically would just do what MGM gave him. This film proves that he couldn't handle more diverse and difficult roles. The other thing I remember about this film is how annoying Lloyd Nolan's character was. Nolan was a great actor, but this character really aggravated me. The last scene of the film has stuck with me for all of these years, but not in a good way. This film is definitely not worth a look."|Negative
"are lowlights of this 1917 feature. The Pride of the Clan tells the story of a young girl who becomes clan chieftain after her father dies. On an island off the coast of Scotland, the villagers live the simple lives of "fisher folk." My copy is very dark and sometimes hard to read, and the film lacks any impressive ocean scenery, with subpar camera work on boats. Maurice Tourneur directed Pickford in this disappointing film. Pickford was already a major star in 1917, and this film seems to have been poorly written just for her: predictable young woman struggles with misfortune. Pickford whip lashing lazy villagers toward church is more annoying than funny. And the final scenes on the sinking ship are poorly executed. A particularly weak Picford film, and not worth seeing. Matt Moore (Pickford was married to his brother, Owen Moore) is the love interest, but is unconvincing as the strapping island lad. Leatrice Joy is one of the villagers but I couldn't spot her either. My copy intersperses lots of bells and gongs and adds an irritating feeling when the village warning bells are rung. Very ineffective."|Negative
"This film really deserves less recognition than it's getting. It's a disappointing and shallow portrayal of blood ties, favours and allegiances within the crime world. The film is shot poorly and fails to delve into classic crime themes such as betrayal and power. This film is a pretentious bore, requiring excessive attention and understanding without any real payoff in the end. It's a poor imitation of The Godfather set in Hong Kong and is an unwelcome change from the more entertaining wire frame fighting, martial arts epics which are the major contribution to the cinema world from Hong Kong and China. It features an arrangement of underdeveloped characters, mediocre actors and lacks character development. I had to watch it twice just to nail what was happening with some of the characters due to the confusing and poorly executed interactions in the film. All in all 2/10 Weak plot and characters, with many that don't stand out at all. The music didn't really get me going and at times I felt it didn't sync well with the action (there is action by the way) which further detracts from the experience."|Negative
"When I first saw this film on cable, it instantly became one of my least favorite movies. Despite being a big fan of James Earl Jones and Robert Duvall, I found their performances disappointing. The movie paints an accurate picture of the South and the racist attitudes, but fails to engage the viewer. Most of the attitudes came from Soll, an old plantation owner who uses convicts for labor. Soll is what ruins the movie, his rambling monologues are tedious and offer little insight into the way The South was back then. I suppose that if Soll lived today he would be diagnosed with Alzheimer's Disease. None the less his attitudes towards a little boy who comes to work for him and the convicts is complex. While he has racist views, he's grown to trust some of the convicts who are all black. The two convicts he trusts most are Jackson(Mel Winkler) and Ben(James Earl Jones). The conversations between Ben and Soll are the worst in the movie, they lack any real chemistry. James Earl Jones and Mel Winkler both put in mediocre performances as well as Hass.<br /><br />This movie deserves its lack of notoriety. Although it's on DVD, it's not worth the money.<br /><br />Rayvyn"|Negative
"Emma is a disappointing romance. If you love the soppy stuff, charged with wit and folly, you will be let down by this movie! While it's true to the novel, which is important, the few twists added for pleasure fall flat. Gwen is not one of my fave actresses and she fails to do justice to a role that required everything that she had to offer in spades. She stumbles in a role i think many other actresses could have done better justice to. <br /><br />Jeremy Northam, as the hero. how shocked are you? I never looked upon him as overtly handsome and this role doesn't change that! He looks awkward as the sensible, regal Mr. K, and I'm literally looking at him in a worse light. He makes a poor romantic lead. The charm and character that he brings to his role is lacking!<br /><br />Ewan McGregor, Greta Sacchi brings in the rest. a mediocre cast. A disappointing movie. If you are a fan of Jane Austen, skip this movie, along with Pride and Prejudice - AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, stick to the books. The movie fails to reach heights that could have been extraordinary"|Negative
"Probably the first Portuguese film I have seen in my life, and I was disappointed. The plot is related of how the young army officers took the power in Portugal in 1974, to finally defeat the fascist government of Caetano and to also finalize the wars in the colonies, i.e. Mozambique, Angola, and Guinea (Bissau)- Cape Vert. Most of the events shown in the film fail to reflect with exactitude the behavior of the army officers and soldiers to conduct the coup, of the oppressed people, who were very happy with this new development and the liberty, the resistance of Caetano's men, and also in a subtle way of most conservative officials, including Spinola, who took over as the new president. The Portuguese revolution can be remembered because of the action of several young officers, but for me the most uninteresting part of the film was when the young captain expressed that Portugal should develop itself democratically, and this is what the country achieved some years after this coup or revolution. The film also shows that the army officers and soldiers never wanted to kill anyone; even the most serious enemies were respected at the end, which I found unrealistic and oversimplified."|Negative
"This film is very uninteresting. I have seen it twice and it seems Glover completely missed the mark with what he claims to he wants to accomplish. I for one cannot relate to the outrage that the filmmaker clearly expresses against the current thoughtless corporate drivel that is an onslaught in our every media center, and the things that we as a culture are supposed to not "think" about due to corporate media control. The outrage that Glover expresses through the "outrageous" elements in the films is both unclear in its visceral aggressiveness and ugly in its poetic attempts. I regret seeing this film and it is even clearer that Glover is up to something pointless with part two of what will be a trilogy. It is not fine! EVERYTHING IS NOT FINE. Avoid that also. People that dismiss this film as "thoughtless" or "pretentious" are really on the right track. This is an unintelligent film. If you can see it with his live show he performs before with his books, that is also not worth your while. The way you get in to his mindset is really off-putting. You will have a terrible experience!"|Negative
"This is one of those movies that I've seen so many times that I can quote most of it. Some of the lines in this movie are just unbearable. I particularly dislike watching him stumble and fall while drunk, go out to the fancy restaurant drunk and the part with the moose.<br /><br />I don't know how many times I have seen this sequence but it's irritating every time. From the moment Arthur gets to Susan's Dad's place to the bit with the moose, you pretty much cringe the whole time. I remember watching the out-takes regarding the bit with the moose. It went down just like I'd imagined it'd be like. They were all struggling so hard it was difficult for them to film it.<br /><br />The late Sir John Gielgud was a terrible addition to this. His demeanor, his one-liners and the way he handled Arthur were all equally grating. It's always an annoying moment when he whacks him over the head with his hat or tells him he's a spoiled little ____. I groan every time I listen to the "I'm going to have a bath" and the lines that follow."|Negative
"I tracked the trip two years ago on the internet - now I've seen the film. What a disappointment! And what a letdown to finally get to know Darius Weems. Such an unremarkable and uninteresting spirit. And what an incompetent Crew! To see Darius's discomfort from being in the water at Panama City, to witness his excessive fear of being too close to alligators in Louisiana, the boredom in his eyes as he rode in a hot air balloon, the unease of rafting through some rapids, the ill-advised bet to eat a spoonful of wasabi, and the awkward phone calls home, and as always - boys will be immature. This film doesn't need to be seen by anyone - young or old. Darius and his mother are hardly models of strength and courage. And the Crew members are poor representatives of the younger generation. They got Darius a new wheelchair, but failed to properly document accessibility problems; they took Darius on a mediocre trip; and they hardly touched any lives. By barely raising awareness of DMD and doing little to encourage funding for research, this film will do little to accomplish the final goal of Darius Goes West - a cure for DMD."|Negative
"I first saw this movie on some movie channel (HBO?) some time ago. I was a fan of Public Enemy, NWA and other early rap and had seen CB4 in theaters. Anyway, the promo for it caught my eye, and I wanted to see what it was all about. Well, right off the bat I knew it was going to be terrible (WARNING!) and I was right. The parody songs alone make this movie hard to watch even once (My Peanuts), and the overall flow and delivery of the movie was poor. You've got to hate the weak satire of rap groups (obviously NWA), certain rappers (Eazy E, Flava Flav, Ice Cube), and the unfunny attempts at humor by the three members of NWH. Who can forget Tone Deaf scratching with his ass? Unfortunately, it's not for a good reason. It's no surprise this movie didn't get much credit, as it was rightfully overshadowed by CB4 during their releases, and in my opinion is a much worse film. If you know and like 90's 'gangster' rap, you'll be cringing and rolling your eyes at this movie. If you aren't into or don't like 'rap', you might enjoy some of the jokes at the expense of the genre, but it's still not worth your time."|Negative
"I remember watching this film, thinking it was so boring. I really didn't care what happens next. I was disappointed by how little they could fit into an 8 minute short. We start in a school yard. Two friends are debating on skipping class. Kid B says to Kid A "Lets not go to class today." And Kid A declines, claiming they could miss something really important. So kid B skips and kid A goes to class. When he gets there the teacher informs him that today they were going to learn the only and most important lesson they will ever learn. They were going to learn the meaning of life. She gives everyone a pamphlet, and when she gets to kid A, she runs out and tells the boy next to him to share. Well, the kid won't share, so Kid A goes looking for the teacher. When he finally finds her, he gets a shocking revelation on what the real meaning of life is. I suggest everyone avoid this short. It will waste 8 minutes of your life, and the message is so trivial, it's not worth your time."|Negative
"I have previously seen Zu: Warriors from the Magic Mountain. In that film, the setting takes place in China's mountains, the Legend of Zu looks like another dimension!! Unfortunately, Tsui Hark's extensive use of CGI effects is overwhelming. He's unable to convincingly portray his vision of mountains floating above the clouds, a land where beings fly freely, and powers ranging from razor sharp wing blades, split swords, and the underwhelming Moon Orb.<br /><br />While there are many characters in this one, the focus is mainly on King Sky and Enigma. The romance aspect is there, although the movie seems much darker than its predecessor. Cecilia Cheung's performance is disappointing and her presence on screen makes this movie a chore to watch. In the beginning, I dislike how she resembles the Countess (from Zu Warriors) and she does poorly playing Enigma as she deals with facing her past life. Oh, by the way, did I mention that Cecilia's acting is quite distracting??<br /><br />In truth, Zu Warriors had more comedy elements and its special effects were limited due to its time in 1983. Tsui Hark takes it to a whole new level of excess and sets a new low standard in cinema."|Negative
"I expected this film to be a run-of-the-mill 1930's romance. Boy meets girl, they fall in love, boy loses girl, boy wins her back in the end. It wasn't like that at all. Clark Gable plays con artist Eddie with his usual overacting and excessive eyebrow raising. He is hiding out from the cops when he bursts into Ruby (Jean Harlow)'s apartment, to find her covered in bubbles in the bathtub, no less. Instant awkwardness. She plays hard to get for a while, and for good reason. The lack of chemistry between them is evident, and there are some scenes that are uncomfortably dated. When a blackmail job goes bad and Ruby ends up in a boarding house for "troubled girls", she is miserable and, thanks to the ragging her roommate gives her, begins to believe that Eddie will never come for her. Harlow overplays the hard-nosed, fast talking Ruby. She tries too hard to match Gable's poor delivery of lines. There is an especially cringe-worthy scene with her playing "their song" on the piano that is acted terribly. The last fifteen minutes have me rolling my eyes every time. A truly disappointing romance."|Negative
"I was disappointed by the movie, and found it unsettling how many troubling aspects of Little Richard's life were portrayed. First of all, I was disturbed by the portrayal of Lucille. There is very little (hardly any) mention of females being intimately involved with Little Richard in other accounts. Even in his life today there is no mention of any involvement of females in a romantic way. I question why this part of his life was included and emphasized. Overall the movie was poor. I also disliked Leon playing the part of Little Richard, he is a mediocre actor and I feel that the part should have gone to a different actor. Visually he did not remind me of Little Richard at all. I also was totally shocked by the promiscuity that Little Richard was shown to be a part of. From the movie he was pictured as a sexual addict. In today's time he would be referred to counseling for his sexual addition. He was portrayed as a voyeur. I don't want to ruin the movie for someone that has not seen the movie however there were several things about the movie that I feel should not have been a part of the final cut and made it quite unpleasant to watch."|Negative
"My family goes back to New Orleans late 1600's early 1700's and in watching the movie I knew it was a history my grand-parents never talked about, but we knew it existed. I have cousins obviously black aka African Americans and others who can "pass" as white and chose not to. It's a hard history to watch when you realize that it's your family they're talking about and that Cane River is all a part of that history. It makes me want to cry and it makes me want to kick the 'arse' of my great grandfathers who owned those plantations and wonder in awe of how my great grandmothers of African heritage lived under that oppressive and yet aristocratic existence...And at the same time had I not come out of that history, I probably wouldn't be the successful business woman I am today living successfully in a fairly integrated world. The acting was both poor and mediocre depending upon the actor, and it is a movie that SHOULDN'T have been made. Anne Rice is disappointing and I ask myself, why is she 'symbolically' writing about my family and I'm not. I do not recommend this movie to anyone. Leza"|Negative
"I was unimpressed and bored after my first viewing of this - many parts of GREY GARDENS are tedious and painfully mundane - documentary or not, this really gives Fellini or David Lynch a run for their money in the dullness sweepstakes. I kept focusing on how these women (who are clinically way beyond eccentric) reveal their own banality in the most predictable of ways, and I wonder whether their retreat from the world was prompted by something beyond the stuffiness of life in the unreal blue-blood universe, perhaps some laziness, or perhaps simply a streak of conformity and complacency that spiralled out of their control and took on a life of its' own. This might be one of the worst ever films that comes dangerously close to exploitation, going completely over the edge - as the Edies do their thing, I kept noting things like the empty gin bottles in the rubble-strewn bedroom, cats urinating on the bed, racoons emerging from holes in the walls, and the final scene seemed incredibly pointless - like a child's birthday party gone boringly wrong. Very definitely not worth seeing or seeking out - you'll want to forget it, and it's not even disturbing enough to be memorable."|Negative
"Japanese animators have a unique freedom with animation, which is why they tend to be able to come out with movies like these, movies that ultimately end up on anime-fans hard-drives and college student's floors, but get completely ignored by pretty much anybody outside of its country of origin. Cat Soup is one of those films that, from Western eyes, is supposed to be experienced on drugs or deeply analyzed. Really, it's just a confusing and disjointed surrealist journey.<br /><br />There's no real dialog, which makes it difficult to follow or engage with for most viewers. A cat and his half-dead (brain-dead?) sister travel through various landscapes of imagination and association. There's a general theme of water, or lack thereof (possibly because of the cat drowning at the beginning? Possibly because of the title?). There's an unsettling sort of Genesis take. There's a disturbing pig that gets to eat itself. An elephant made of water. And it's bewildering, off-putting, tedious, and frustrating--especially when watched around druggies who cannot experience anything visually unique without comparing it to an acid trip. Eventually the movie turns itself off, adding another perplexing self-reflexive level to the proceedings.<br /><br />--PolarisDiB"|Negative
"Remember these two stories with disappointment. In the first, set in the not too distant future, we see a young boy preparing for examination day, the state i.q test. The boy is slightly puzzled as to his parents anxiety as some of his friends have already done it already and eventually goes off to do the test. Upon arriving he is given an injection and is curious as to why. The examiner smiles and tells him that it is just to make sure he tells the truth. The boy then asks, puzzled again, why wouldn't he? It is later and the parents are sitting waiting worriedly by the screen when a message appears and declares that the state are sorry, but their son's i.q level has exceeded the national quotient and ask politely would they like a private burial. A predictable and cliché concluding scene! A Message From Charity was a tedious story about a fluke mental connection between a girl from the past and a guy from the present. Which pans out into a convoluted story of witchcraft accusations in the past and dull delving into the history pages in the present. A lackluster story with an unsatisfying conclusion."|Negative
""This Man's Navy" is, as other comments have indicated, a rare but poorly-filmed look at Navy lighter than air (LTA) activities. The LTA crews' pride in their convoy protection seems misplaced, given the questionable effectiveness of their efforts. The filming at the various NAS locations, while providing a glimpse at a type of aviation that is long gone, feels dull and uninspired. The first half of the movie is tediously focused on Beery, his relationship with his service pals, and him meeting the Tom Drake character and his mother, and getting Drake's leg fixed. Only then does the second film start, which isn't much better. The second film shows LTAs in action, taking on a surfaced sub, with guys getting killed and much damage caused. The look, while attempting to be gritty and realistic, comes off as contrived and unconvincing. Then we shift to Southeast Asia. Did the Navy have LTAs there? Never mind, this part is ridiculous, with a blimp being used to extract some downed aircrew from the jungle. And the Japs are shooting like mad. Shades of Vietnam, except the getaway is painfully slow and unrealistic. This is a blimp we're talking about. In the end, a disappointing WWII drama about a very unusual part of the war that fails to engage or entertain."|Negative
"I viewed the movie together with a homophobic friend, my wife and her female friend. So I had views from all kinds of directions. Disappointingly, the film failed to make me laugh, the sexual tension was lacking and only Tudor Chirila and Maria Popistasu stood out. While I appreciate that she played her role well, the script was clearly inadequate. There were good Romanian actors around, but they were wasted on superficial roles. I'm skeptical about Puya's entering the movie business. I don't know why, but I doubt he'll be a good actor.<br /><br />Surprisingly, my wife hated the movie, and I think there might have been nuances that were lost on all of us. If the film tried to present uncommon sexual behaviors and their consequences in todays Romania, then it succeeded admirably. There were significant consequences. Just imagine that the girls are actually a boy and a girl, and the same story becomes a compelling, intriguing plot.<br /><br />I can clearly see why it got all those BAFTA awards. In my book, it deserves the "Outstanding Achievement" award. (bafta=good luck in Romanian)."|Negative
"How many of us wish that we could throw away social and cultural obligations and be free? Most of us, I suspect. Shall we dance? is not a movie about dancing. It is about learning about ourselves, recognising what we are looking for in life and having the courage to go in search of it. Mr Sugiyama is a middle-aged member of a Japanese society where ballroom dancing is viewed as unsuitable behaviour. <br /><br />One day Mr Sugiyama sees a beautiful girl leaning out of the window of a dancing acadamy. he is fascinated by her and eventually signs up for dancing lessons. He is ashamed of his dancing and afraid of ridicule. He hides the fact that he is attending dancing classes from his colleagues and family.<br /><br />There is a cringe-worthy scene in the mensroom at the office when Sugiyama and Watanabe, a workmate who also dances, are interrupted practising some dance steps. There are many other awkward and uncomfortable scenes.<br /><br />The ending is disappointing and leaves the viewer feeling unsatisfied.<br /><br />This movie failed to help me understand the Japanese people any better. It is a tedious and forgettable film to see."|Negative
"This is undoubtedly one of the most disappointing movies ever made. Amitabh as a country bumpkin, Arjun Singh, is cringeworthy. The worst thing is the boredom never stops. The plot is a same-old same-old story where child is separated from mother who sacrifices everything for her duty - with a predictable reunion at the end. There are villains (Ranjit) and there are brothers (Sashi Kapoor) and there are vixens (Parveen Babhi) and there are lovers (Smita Patil) and there is a blind brother and a grandfather thrown in for good measure. But this movie is about Amitabh and that's all you remember at the end, unfortunately.<br /><br />Amitabh comes to the city to make a decent living and his dialogue delivery and mannerisms are painfully exaggerated. Later in the movie he turns into the Angry Young Man he is famous for but the tedium stays. Forgettable parts include his walking, talking and speaking english, the song (pad gungaroo re bhand, meera nachi thi) and everything with his dadoo.<br /><br />All in all I was rolling my eyes throughout the movie. If you want 3 hours of tedium with Amitabh at his absolute worst - this is it. I would easily give it a 1/10."|Negative
"Disappointingly mediocre period piece set in the 30s, it is a lackluster spin on the classic cliffhanger series, reminiscent of "Raiders of the Lost Ark", but done on a low budget and excessively campy by director Michael Anderson. The opening scenes laces liberal amount of gothic art nuveau, predating Batman by two decades. Starring Ron Ely (Tarzan) as a miscast hero and the underwhelming Pamela Hensley as the local latina Mona tagging on to our hero on a goldhunt in the non-existent latin american country of Hidalgo. Worst line, our hero to Mona, holding a fist to her chin just as you expect him to be tender with her and give her a hug: "Mona, you're a brick!"<br /><br />Paul Wexler's ham-and-cheese blackhat, Captain Seas is an irritating caricature. Expect a little "Raiders..", a dash of "Batman", a little "The Lost World", a little "Lost Horizons" and an overwhelming amount of campiness and you'll get it just right. Watch out for cult favorite Michael Berryman in a small part as undertaker and endure the annoying use of John Philip Sousa's patriotic music. A film best left forgotten, it certainly doesn't warrant a DVD release. A forgettable experience that's hard to sit through. 3/10"|Negative
"Henry Fonda fails to capture what we have long believed Abraham Lincoln was like. It is a disappointment. Through Fonda's performance we are led to believe (on the surface) that Abraham Lincoln was a country bumpkin. But, even through his confrontation with the lynch mob and during the court proceedings, you can see that beneath the exterior posturings is a man who lacks command of what is going on around him and struggles to influence the people around him. <br /><br />In this movie Henry Fonda shows that he has a poor grasp of how to present humor. His timing is off when telling stories and jokes. There is a sequence in the trial that falls flat and is not at all funny. This lackluster comedic performance is evident again in The Lady Eve in 1940.<br /><br />The ending by John Ford is disappointingly heavy-handed with Henry Fonda going to the top of a hill and in the distance a tremendous storm symbolic of the Civil War. He goes forward into history. The movie is fiction and the insight into Lincoln is superficial. Definitely not worth seeing again."|Negative
"Last November, I had a chance to see this film at the Reno Film Festival. I have to say that it was a disappointment. A few tech errors were just the beginning of its problems. I disliked the writing and acting, especially from the guy that played the lead role. There is a lack of heart in this movie, and the wit falls flat. I got a chance to speak with a few of the filmmakers after it was done, and they seemed arrogant. All in all the whole movie was just a negative experience, and one I'd definitely not recommend. The story was boring and unoriginal, as a woman I've been through a lot of the same problems as the lead guy, but I couldn't relate to his portrayal at all. The movie does a poor job of giving us people we can sympathize with. The friends in the movie are poorly written too, they are unrealistic. I know people like these, and they sound much more natural than these characters when they talk. The whole movie is just real disappointing, I wish there weren't more films out there like it.<br /><br />- Jayden"|Negative
"Ultra-grim crime drama from Pou-Soi Cheang, the director of "Home Sweet Home". Tonally, it reminded me of Billy Tang's "Run and Kill", although it's not as polished as that. Nevertheless, it's a disappointing, flawed bit of mayhem about a Cambodian loner, Pang (Edison Chen), who arrives in Hong Kong to kill a lawyer. While fleeing the scene, he kills the partner of cop Sam Wai, who, to add insult to injury, is in the midst of dealing with his dying father, so Sam begins an insane, obsessive manhunt for Pang that results in close to a dozen dead bodies and relentless violence. There must be something in the air lately because I've never seen so many humans beating the pulp out of each other as I have lately. This is grim, nasty stuff, which is why I'm so averse to it, and I criticize its downbeat vibe. It's visually jarring and the sound design is very off-putting. Dramatically, everything spirals downwards until every character finds him- or herself in a world of screaming pain. A subplot involving Pang's attachment to a sexually abused girl adds an unnecessary layer to the story and spawns a disappointing fourth act which boasts an unpleasant act of grotesque surgery."|Negative
"This sweeping drama falls short on many levels: disappointing acting, mediocre photography, weak story. It is often compared to "Braveheart" because both movies take place in historical Scotland. Even though I love Braveheart, I think this is the worse of the two films. Jessica Lange gave an underwhelming performance (rightfully not nominated for an Oscar). Liam Neeson is unconvincing in the title role. Tim Roth plays one of the most forgettable, bland characters in film history (he was undeservedly nominated for an Oscar). John Hurt is lackluster as Lord Montrose, another uninteresting character. I am always disappointed by the limited range of characters that John Hurt plays. This is a story of a dispute over money between Rob Roy and his clan, and Lord Montrose. Rob Roy is a self made man, who will not solve his problems with Montrose if it violates his sense of honor. Montrose, who, inherited his title, has no sense of honor. And that is basically what this story is all about; honor of the common man versus corruption of the nobility. This movie is very dull, it will likely bore most viewers. It has clichéd romance, poorly executed action, uninspired scenery, and has a predictable plot. One of my least favorite films."|Negative
"William H. Macy is at his least sympathetic and compelling here as a hit-man and loving father who wants to step out of the family business without angering his overbearing parents. Treads much of the same territory as TV's "The Sopranos" in terms of the mid-life crisis of a criminal theme (here too he visits a shrink) and is hardly worth watching despite some taut direction from Brommel (I dread what this guy directs next), a mediocre script, and generally disappointing performances. Macy is subpar as always. This is probably his worst role since "Fargo." Donald Sutherland is unconvincing as the domineering father. Tracy Ullman gives a surprisingly flat dramatic turn as Macy's wife. Young David Dorfman is lackluster as Macy's bright and sensitive son (many of his lines sound forced and are cringe-worthy). Even Neve Campell (who I usually find tolerable) is unimpressive as the troubled young woman who captures Macy's eye. All of this is punctuated by a dull score and sluggish pace that lead up to a predictable and weak climax and meaningless and hollow aftermath. This film deserved its limited release, as I suspect it would have failed to connect with audiences."|Negative
"A brilliant chess player attends a tournament and falls in love with a woman he meets there. On itself this would be a pretty bad angle on a story. So, there is more. There is the fact that the chess player is also completely alienated from the world because of his brilliance at the game and the fact there is some history haunting the player.<br /><br />This film awkwardly jumps back and forth from romantic frivolity to tournament tension to historic events that shaped the chess player and fails to work cohesively. It's hard to grow attached to the two main characters and difficult to believe they might hit it off together like the way they do in this film. The added effect of the tournament is underwhelming and fails to create any real tension.<br /><br />I have no idea of the strength of the chess players as I don't play the game myself but it looks unconvincing and unrealistic. All in all, most of the film is a struggle to get through. It is, however, unfortunately memorable for all the wrong reasons. So it's unpleasant to watch and nothing more than that.<br /><br />3 out of 10 chess players caught between a rook and a hard place"|Negative
"Liam Neeson portrays the Scottish legend Robert Roy Macgregor from the early 18th century. He fails to captivate the audience, lacking the charisma he usually brings to his roles. Jessica Lange is unconvincing as his wife Mary. Mary is supposed to be a beautiful woman, but their on-screen chemistry falls flat. It's unclear why Rob Roy becomes a legend, and their love seems forced. Tim Roth as the evil Cunningham is one-dimensional; his portrayal of villainy is cartoonish and unbelievable. The Scotland scenery is dull and poorly captured. The environment and conditions of the times are depicted inaccurately. If you like history, romance, passion and love, you'll be disappointed by Rob Roy. There is excessive violence and blood, which feels gratuitous and unnecessary for the story. The Scottish accents are so thick that it's often impossible to understand the dialogue. One major flaw of this movie is that the actors look too polished and glamorous throughout; they never appear authentically dirty or unattractive, which breaks the immersion. It's their star power as actors that the film relies on, rather than their skill or the strength of the story. This is nothing special."|Negative
"I consider myself a great admirer of David Lynch's works, for he provides the viewers with absolutely unique motion pictures with typical "Lynch-elements." Having seen most of his works, I naively thought I could predict Lynch's next step. I was dead wrong. Dumbland is something I could have never imagined under the name of David Lynch. Even after my recovery from the first shock, I struggled to find any redeeming qualities in this extremely primitive main character, and I drew the conclusion that all the absurdities, cruelty, brutality and disgust presented here are simply too much, even when viewed as a distorted mirror of reality. There are things in our lives we hardly ever emphasize, for they are either disgusting or horrible, however, they are surrounding us, so I take the courage to say, Dumbland focuses on these bits and pieces in a way that's more off-putting than insightful. This is not a movie to enjoy, and even if you occasionally laugh out of a strange, perverted sense of humor, this animated reflection of all things we rather reject to observe, with its simplicity, morbidity and absurdity, ultimately feels pointless and unpleasant. It's hard to take it as it is, and you don't have to like it. It just exists, but that doesn't justify its creation. And finally, even if you're attentive enough to find elements typical to Lynch, they're overshadowed by the overall unpleasantness. I cannot recommend it, even for tolerant people!!!"|Negative
"In New York, the family man dentist Alan Johnson (Don Cheadle) meets his former roommate and friend Charlie Fineman (Adam Sandler) by chance on the street. Charlie became a lonely and deranged man after the loss of his wife and three daughters in the tragic September 11th while Alan has problems to discuss his innermost feelings with his wife. Alan reties his friendship with Charlie and they become close to each other. Alan tries to fix Charlie's life, sending him to the psychologist Angela Oakhurst (Liv Tyler), but Charlie has an aggressive reaction to the treatment and is send to court.<br /><br />"Reign Over Me" is a disappointing drama about loss, friendship, family and loneliness. The September 11th is irrelevant to the plot; it could be a car accident, a fire or any other tragedy, as well as the sexual harassment of Donna Remar, played by the gorgeous Saffron Burrows, to Alan. The family drama falls flat, despite the efforts of Adam Sandler and Don Cheadle. Liv Tyler is quite impossible to be recognized, I do not know whether she is using excessive make-up to look older, but her face is weird. My vote is four.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): "Reine Sobre Mim" ("Reign Over Me")|Negative
"Centered in the downtown and out skirts of Detroit, this comedy I found to be a disappointing attempt at a new comedic duo. 'Noriyuki Pat Morita' is a mediocre actor, who happens to be a cop from Japan on the trail of an industrial secrets thief, who has stolen a 'proto type' turbo super charger, reluctantly he goes to the United States to follow the thief, after being ordered by his commander. Pat's character collides with 'Jay Leno's' character, a fast talking' but down to business-player type Detroit cop. When they cross paths though, the honorable 'Ways' of Japan meet the all-out old school Detroit police investigative 'Ways'. The two stumble and trip over each other throughout, failing to develop any real chemistry or effective teamwork. After struggling with a city crime boss for the stolen 'equiptment' and barely closing the case, these two go from despising each other to tolerating each other's presence. A little worse for wear and in need of an extended-vacation on top of it all, they manage to come to an unsatisfying closing. I rated this a 3. Lewis's direction makes' this a nearly unwatchable comedy. Not suitable for all ages. I cannot recommend it.(*)"|Negative
"THE 40 YEAR-OLD VIRGIN (2005) * Steve Carell, Catherine Keener, Paul Rudd, Romany Malco, Seth Rogen, Elizabeth Banks, Leslie Mann, Jane Lynch, Gerry Bednob, Shelley Malil, Kat Dennings. Painfully unfunny high-concept comedy about the titular Andy Stitzer (disappointingly played by perennial second banana Carell in a truly underwhelming comic performance sure to relegate him to the D-list), a tech services rep for an electronics store in Southern California who is found out about his secretive identity by a trio of misguided and entirely clueless womanizing co-worker buddies (Rudd, Malco & Rogen, each one degree more annoying than the next) determined to get their friend deflowered no matter the cost. What follows is an unlikely and very contrived romance with a one-dimensional mother (the usually marvelous Keener wasted here) leading to add more tedium to Andy's journey. A surprisingly mean-spirited and unapologetically crude attempt at a romantic comedy; the least funny since "There's Something About Mary" with a poorly written script by director Judd Apatow and Carell that features some astoundingly cringe-worthy sequences including a tasteless David Caruso joke, offensive homophobic ribbing, tired send-ups of 'date-a-paloozas' and oversimplifying the war of the sexes with juvenile attempts at humor. A true disappointment and an instant flop; the most boring film of the year."|Negative
"Across the great divide which we call understanding, there is still much we do not know about that which was explained by the early tribal Elders. In every instance, there is much concerning the dangers of knowing too much. Conversely, there are those who warn us of not preparing for what they warn is the 'End Time.' In this movie called " The Last Wave " an aboriginal native is murdered for no apparent reason. When those responsible are arrested, they remain silent less they disturb the order of things. David Burton (Richard Chamberlain) plays the Defense Attorney assigned to defend the accused. Although haunted by prophetic images from his own childhood and warned by modern signs given to him by an sympathetic Aboriginal named Chris Lee (David Gulpilil), Burton proceeds to defend the infraction as Tribal Law and therefore not subject to standard justice. The movie is fraught with puzzling, dark foreboding images of apocalyptic end world disasters and warns of a future island tsunami and doom. Black drama and deep rituals are what gives this film its unsettling and confusing nature, making it difficult to follow or appreciate. In fact, the simplest haunting apparitions can be easily forgotten, failing to leave any lasting impression on movie goers. Poor silent drama. *"|Negative
"I think if you were to ask most JW's whether they expect a miracle cure because of their faith, you will find they do. I know I do. What you will find is that they believe the promises Christ made of a resurrection are false. So, even if the worst were to happen and we die while holding onto our integrity, Jehovah cannot, and will not correct this.<br /><br />It really gets down to a simple question: is God real to you or is this all just make believe? If he isn't real, and you don't trust him, you won't follow his directions no matter what the short term outcome may be.<br /><br />I had a heart attack about a year and a half ago. One in my family was relieved when she saw the words "ACCEPT BLOOD" written in large letters over my chart. I reasoned with her that if I were in a position that only a blood transfusion would save my life, would that be a good time to anger the only one could return me to life when the time came? She got it -- God just isn't real enough to me. Too bad. I wish I could have the comfort a strong faith gives."|Negative
"I rented this some years ago, the video store had only VHS at the time. Straight to video was hitting it's strides (you know, where the box covers use the same font and color schemes of successful films).I didn't know what to expect other than what was printed. First thing I thought while watching was "what the hells' wrong with the sound?"-Obviously there was no dialogue dubbing. Words echoed, so I stopped munching on whatever I had to pay closer attention-mind you there's no Shakespeare here!,just simple talk. The story is simple enough, boy meets girl etc.. What struck me as frustrating and disappointing was, the people in the movie seemed like caricatures written into the story, rather than real actors suited for their roles. All the while, you begin to sense what the filmmaker is after, then see that there are numerous attempts at cheap humor (people hurting their privates, using vulgarities) which couldn't have helped the marketing. There was something dishonest about it. I thought if they'd have a bigger budget then it would have been better, which i'm sure they considered daily, but they shouldn't have gone ahead and made it. This, I felt, was what amateur film-making is all about. The word "Indy", is thrown around as if it's a Genre..Ha!..that's sad!"|Negative
"Nina Foch insists that "My Name is Julia Ross" in this 1945 film noir also starring Dame May Witty and George Macready. It's short, and because it is, the film benefits. Its concise runtime is perfect for the story it tells.<br /><br />When I was growing up, Foch was a fixture on television, playing a neurotic woman, the wife with the cheating husband, the nervous wreck. She became one of the great acting teachers in Los Angeles. Here, she's a pretty young ingenue playing the title role. Julia answers an ad for a secretary and is hired immediately by Mrs. Hughes and her son Ralph. Little does she know - though we learn immediately - that the employment agent is a front, set up to get just the right woman for this assignment, a woman with no family and no boyfriend.<br /><br />It's a live-in situation; once Julia gets to the house, she's drugged, and when she wakes up, she's told she's Mrs. Hughes and not allowed to leave.<br /><br />The acting is mediocre at best. Despite its low budget, the film fails to entertain - some things, particularly at the end, happen at just the right pace, which is why I said the movie's runtime is perfect. Overall, I cannot recommend it."|Negative
"The Williams family live on a ranch located in the middle of the remote desert. They find themselves in considerable peril when the place is suddenly thrust into a time vortex where the past, present and future collide in a wildly chaotic and unpredictable manner. Director John "Bud" Cardos begins the film on a confusingly muddled note and gradually allows things to get more bewildering, frustrating and tedious as the nonsensical story unfolds. Moreover, Cardos fills the screen with jarring visuals and fails to create any sense of genuine awe or wonder. The unconvincing acting from a struggling cast is another major drawback: Jim Davis as stiff patriarch Grant Williams, Dorothy Malone as his grating wife Ana, Christopher Mitchum as the irritating Richard, Marcy Lafferty as his bland wife Beth, Natasha Ryan as annoying little girl Jenny, and Scott C. Kolden as the reckless Steve. The cheap special effects offer an uninspired combo of shoddy miniatures, clumsy stop-motion animation monsters (said creatures include a tiny spindly hairless guy, a big, lumpy, fanged beast, and a scrawny lizard dude), and amateurish matte paintings. Richard Band's overbearing full-bore orchestral score really misses the mark. John Arthur Morrill's harsh, glaring cinematography likewise fails to impress. A tedious flick."|Negative
"I was really disappointed with this movie. Going in to the sneak preview, knowing nothing about the movie except for the one trailer I'd seen, I thought it was going to be a smart, original comedy. Instead I got a Dude Where's My Car kind of crap fest. It was full of bad sex jokes and farting and a pathetic lead character who will get laid in the end because that's just how movies work.<br /><br />Yes, the film is chock full o' sex jokes and vulgarity and the occasional hey-look-a-nipple!, but it's done in the spirit of Sorority Boys rather than Bad Santa. All the characters are caricatures you'd never encounter in real life, unredeemable friends who are just trying to exploit a brother and live their shallow lives.<br /><br />I went in thinking this movie was going to be great, and I was very disappointed. It's extremely over the top (c'mon, it's a movie about a 40 year old virgin!), and it's very poorly done.<br /><br />In the end, you couldn't care less if this guy gets laid, which says a lot about the movie because honestly, did you really care if Ashton Kutcher found his car or not?"|Negative
"The final chapter in the Hanzo the Razor trilogy provides a disappointing conclusion to this problematic series of samuraisploitation. Inoue replaces Yasuzu Masumura (Blind Beast, Red Angel, Manji) in the director's chair, but the style remains regrettably similar, perhaps due to Shintaro Katsu serving as the producer, apart from the titular antihero.<br /><br />Hanzo uncovers a female ghost who is guarding treasure hidden in the bottom of the lake. Of course, Hanzo being Hanzo, he's not put off by the fact she's a ghost, so he proceeds to rape... ahem, interrogate her, using the now familiar revolving net device. The plot takes through a series of blind monks who also doubletime as loansharks, corrupt officials, promiscuous wives and the necessary hack and slash. Hanzo's superior officer, Onishi, and his two servants, provide the typical comedic notes, but it all feels stale and uninspired.<br /><br />While less convoluted and easier to follow than the first (which is all over the place and a bit of a mess), and less stylish, dramatic and bloody than the second (arguably the least offensive in the Hanzo series), it's still tedious and hardly worthwhile on its own merits. Complete with trademark training sequences, the obligatory rape, swordfights, and a mystery Hanzo is called upon to investigate, this will ultimately disappoint even the most devoted fans."|Negative
"First of all no adaptation is ever as good as the book, especially when you're dealing with master writer like Tolkien. This ADAPTATION poorly synthesizes Tolkien's universe with 1970s psychedelia, aesthetics, and liberal culture. Yes - the animation and background painting is often "rough" in its technical execution and it's unappealing, failing to give a unique "sense of place" to each of the scenes. Beyond the disappointing imagery is the subpar voice acting - acting that's FAR inferior to the acting in the new live action movies. And while the cell animation might not be the most "technically proficient" animation it fails to capture the expressive bodily and facial gestures of the acting, often being too exaggerated and lacking subtlety. The background paintings vary from traditional "fantasy" motif to outright abstraction, but the transition to abstracted settings feels forced and detracts from the themes of the film. If you're a person who has to have extensive computer rendering in a film so that everything is visualized for you then I can see how you might like this movie but if you enjoy superior acting, transcendental imagery, and JRR Tolkien then this film is best avoided."|Negative
"Lacking in symbolism and filled with uninspired cinematography, Extase is nothing more than the erotic drama we've all come to expect. This is almost a silent film, with what dialogue there is in German, and highly simplified German at that. Perhaps the filmmakers intended the film to reach the widest possible European audience, as anyone with even a little high school level Deutsch can easily dispense with the subtitles. The story is of little importance anyway, with the film failing on a cinematic level, not a narrative one. Symbols of fecundity and the power of nature overwhelm the human characters--there are even scenes where flowers obscure the face of supposed star Hedy Lamarr--and there are moments here that will remind viewers of the worst aspects of Dreyer, Vertov, and Riefenstahl. If the film has any message to convey, I think it's a political one: bourgeois man is timid and impotent; working class man is a happy, productive creature; and woman is the creator, destined to be unfulfilled until she has borne a child. This blend of Soviet socialist realism and National Socialist dogma overwhelms the film completely--it's a chore to watch from beginning to end--and it places it in a very distinct artistic era. And, oh yeah, Hedy does get her kit off."|Negative
"Serials were short subjects originally shown in theaters in conjunction with a feature film that were related to pulp magazine serialized fiction. Known as "chapter plays," they were extended motion pictures broken into a number of segments called "chapters" or "episodes." Each chapter would be screened at the same theater for one week. The serial would end with a cliffhanger, as the hero and heroine would find themselves in the latest perilous situation from which there could be no escape.<br /><br />The audience would have to return the next week to find out how the hero and heroine would escape and battle the villain once again. Serials were especially popular with children, and for many children in the first half of the 20th century, a typical Saturday at the movies included a chapter of at least one serial, along with animated cartoons, newsreels, and two feature films.<br /><br />The golden age for serials was 1936-1945. Unfortunately, this was one of the worst of the era.<br /><br />Zorro has been seen in many films, but Reed Hadley ("Racket Squad", The Undying Brain) was disappointing in the role.<br /><br />The action is tedious, and we are dragged chapter by chapter to an underwhelming end where we find out the identity of the evildoer.<br /><br />Zorro triumphs, as he always does, but in this case, it's hardly satisfying."|Negative
"I've read a few of the reviews and I'm kinda disappointed that a lot of the Story seems glossed over. Its easy to do because its not a Book, its a movie and there's only so much that can be done in a movie- US Or Canadian- or anywhere.<br /><br />Colm Feore does, at least for a recovering "F@g-Hag" like myself, a mediocre job of playing the 'friendly neighborhood' gay man- and his portrayal of being sick is unconvincing. I mean, the man doesn't look pale enough! And the strip down near the... um, end, feels awkward and unnecessary.<br /><br />If you need decrepit, there are a few SKing movies you might like.<br /><br />Being the daughter of a Recovering Alchoholic, the druggie brother {David Cubitt} was the trick for me. I'm going to give him cred, he grew up quick- and believe me that's good. And, as an Aspiring writer, moimeme, I can dig a lot of his insights and overviews. But I'm more prosy than poetic.<br /><br />I may be hard to please, but I didn't enjoy it. A lackluster story poorly put together- by Canadians, quelle surprise. Just crossed the line into 'Movie of the week' territory, being as drawn out as expected. And it was rather clumsily portrayed."|Negative
"I watched this film sort of by accident, having bought it as the B side on The Omega Man DVD. The Omega Man was a bit of a disappointment - except for the beginning, which was clearly the inspiration for 28 Days Later, the rest of it is just the stuff of TV movies. Soylent Green, unfortunately, is in the same league. I doubt this is one of Tarantino's favourites. There are at least 3 scenes in the film that are just bizarre and off-putting. Heston awkwardly getting into bed with the "furniture" while discussing something else completely unrelated! A whole crowd of people being scooped up by a fleet of mechanical diggers! A priest taking confession and being shot by the confessor. These scenes feel forced and out of place. And what the heck is going on between Heston and Edward G. Robinson? Is this the most unlikely gay couple ever, or what? Unfortunately, I saw this film without knowing the ending - which apparently is rare. Then I watched it again, and found all the little clues that make the long early scenes tedious. A poorly executed script - and some unimpressive sets too. Just when you thought you'd seen everything . . ."|Negative
"This disappointing tale of intergenerational love, jealousy and revenge was even less enjoyable to see on DVD years after its PBS broadcast, with an unremarkable picture and muddled sound. My reservations are that the plot has numerous improbable moments and that the stronger Manchester accents are often incomprehensible. Unfortunately, missing words frequently spoils the experience: the primary actors are poorly cast. Robson Green brings an unconvincing smile, a lackluster temperament and a stiff physicality to his role as a young surgeon who implausibly falls for the wife of his boss at the hospital where he's just begun to work. Francesca Annis is one of the least appealing 50-ish women imaginable; her acting is as underwhelming as her beauty. (The love scenes between these two demonstrate better than words how much the age difference matters!) Each of the supporting characters is one-dimensional and poorly portrayed. The mix of dull dialog and melodramatic excess makes this a tedious miniseries. As Russell Baker notes in his introduction, you may not be morally improved by viewing "Reckless" -- and you won't have much fun either. (The sequel, a part of the DVD box set, provides an unsatisfying and convoluted two-hour denouement. You won't want to watch it even if you've somehow enjoyed what came before.)|Negative
"This really isn't a great movie. Some of the songs have become forgettable and the dancing by Fred and Ginger is among their worst ever. But basically, all of Fred and Ginger's movies are the same. After the mediocre singing and dancing is over, it's the other characters in the movie who make the movie fail. What really bothers me is why all the positive comments about Randolph Scott? His romance with Harriet Hilliard and the sub plot of the movie is the reason why I avoid watching this over and over again. He detracts from this movie, he doesn't add to it. He has an off-putting personality and an awkward smile. Randy is in my bottom ten all time least favorites list. It's disappointing to see him as something other than a cowboy. OK, so he isn't really a great actor, and like so many other stars: Errol Flynn, Alan Ladd, Victor Mature, etc. he was very unlikable and could never rise to the top on any occasions. All of Fred and Ginger's movies had sub plots that depended on other actors to fill in the space between the musical numbers, which made the movies drag on for too long. I just wish fewer people would appreciate Randy and I felt a need to criticize him."|Negative
"Dick Tracy is one of my least favorite films. I must admit to those that haven't seen it. You will either really love it or really hate it. It came out a year after the success of Batman. So everyone's expectations were so high that many were let down simply because the plot is so simple. And it's based on a comic strip...what did you expect? Creatively, this movie is disappointing. The sets, make-up, music, costumes, and the unimpressive acting make this film lackluster. The film has bloodless violence and no bad language - that's something rare these days. Directed, produced, and stars Warren Beatty as the ace crime fighter going up against Al Pacino's evil Big Boy Caprice and his mob of thugs. Madonna fails to impress as the seductive Breathless Mahoney. This is one of the worst characters Madonna has ever played. She has the most cringeworthy one liners I've heard! Madonna fans would hate it! One of the most gimmicky things about the film is that they only used seven colors to make it look like a comic strip. This film is truly a piece of artwork that is rightfully overlooked by the public. To sum things up, this film brings out the cynic in all of us. It's a film that will leave you frowning at the end."|Negative
"I've been reading through some of the other user comments and decided to put one in too. Some of the users are stuck in a 'realist' type of mentality. This film was meant to be a 'fantasy'....a 'what if' fun film. It was never meant to be 'real' or serious. Unfortunately, it was thoroughly disappointing for everyone I knew when it came out - even though it shadowed the tragedy of the Challenger explosion...I was 30 at the time and totally disliked this one - my young son hated it too! Later, I shared it with my daughter and she, too, disliked it. SpaceCamp is a frustrating family film that should be avoided for just that - frustration. All the 'realists' in the world should stick to watching documentaries or docudramas and avoid this type of film. So sorry for those young folks who watched this movie first and then were able to go to the real SpaceCamp (one in Alabama and one at Vandenberg AFB in California) - they must have gone expecting to find the same type of environment that was portrayed in the movie and then felt 'letdown'...I guess their parents didn't explain the difference between fantasy and reality. Oh well. If you love fantasy-fun films and haven't seen this one, I highly recommend avoiding it! Don't bother."|Negative
"Unlike the great classic Bugs Bunny cartoons, this movie lacks humor at different levels. I just introduced this to my 10 year old daughter and 11 year old son. Neither enjoyed the movie - barely cracking a smile... and my daughter is not much of a sci-fi fan. The movie failed to keep me laughing despite having seen it a few times... the adult-level humor (that is, humor that adults will get simply because of greater life experiences, no baudy or R-rated stuff to be found here) fails to make the movie enjoyable for adults. For example of the adult level humor, the Martian voices are based on characters of different movies/actors, but fall flat. The Martian pilot, Blaznee, has a poor imitation of Jack Nicholson's voice and mannerisms; the scientist, a weak copy of Peter Seller's Dr. Strangelove. The special effects are surprisingly poor for this film. The lack of top 10 actors actually works against the movie, and the actors/actresses struggle in their roles - in fact I would say the producers picked out actors based on box-office draw power over skills for the roles' needs (an unfortunate example is Wayne Alexander's "Vern" character). I had to write this review... the kids are refusing to watch it again after seeing it once. Not good for a rainy day or a late night weekend there's-nothing-on-and-I'm-bored movie."|Negative
"I just saw this last night, it was broadcast on the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's 'Passionate Eye' series. It has been screened recently (Sept. 2003) at the Toronto International Film Festival as well as many others. It is a quite disappointing film. The filmmakers literally stumbled into the story, being there to make a documentary about Chavez himself. Instead, they found themselves squarely in the middle of events as the coup unfolded. They had unprecedented access to events and people but failed to present an unbiased perspective. They, of course, have their own ideological perspective (which they make evident) and they keep pushing it to the forefront, instead of focusing on the events, the people, and the background and history leading up to the coup. As a film, it is not ground-breaking in a stylistic or aesthetic sense, and that is a major drawback. What we get to see is a flawed attempt at 'embedded' journalism. What we get to see is a biased account of a country's political turmoil... a controversial leader (Chavez) whose motives are questionable... a simplistic story about power and greed that fails to capture the complexities of the situation... and wasted access to a historical event as it unfolds.<br /><br />"|Negative
"There is indeed much to complain about this movie version of Molnar's mystical play --Farrell looks good in his title role, but his line readings, frankly, stink. This also suffers, in large part, from this being credited as the first movie that makes use of rear projection. The sets look phony.<br /><br />Unfortunately, there are no redeeming qualities in this show. The visual performances are as disappointing as the dialogue readings. Rose Hobart, as Julie, is little remembered today: mostly for ROSE HOBART, in which Joseph Cornell cut down the programmer EAST OF BORNEO to simply shots of her: credit Melford's stylish visual direction of the original. Her beauty can't salvage her stagy performance, which only adds to the damage in the earth-bound sections of this movie.<br /><br />One of Borzage's themes is the mystical power of love, but the handling of the celestial sections fails to impress, from the arrival of the celestial train to the journey to 'the Hot Place'. Even H.B. Warner's usually reliable performance falls flat here.<br /><br />So we have here a deeply flawed and uninteresting version. I think that Lang's 1934 version is far superior, as well as the celestial scenes in the Henry King version of CAROUSEL, the watered-down musical remake. I couldn't enjoy this version at all and would not recommend giving it a chance."|Negative
"After the success of the second instalment, Richard Curtis and Ben Elton decided that Blackadder should have a third appearance. This time instead of Tudor times or Elizabethan times, Edmund Blackadder (BAFTA nominated Rowan Atkinson) is living in the time of the French Revolution. Accompanied by the now stupid but lovable Baldrick (Tony Robinson) Blackadder is the "faithful" butler to George, the Prince Regent of Wales (Hugh Laurie). Throughout this third series to the poorly written sitcom Blackadder tries everything he can to get rich and powerful. He tries electing a lord for a rotten borough, tries to sell a book, tries to win a bet about The Scarlet Pimpernel, tries to be a highway man and finally poses as the Prince. This is a very disappointing instalment to the once-popular comedy. Includes appearances from Robbie Coltrane, Tim McInnerny, Miranda Richardson and Stephen Fry. Despite winning the BAFTA for Best Comedy Series, and being nominated for Best Design and Best Make Up, the series falls flat. Rowan Atkinson was number 18 on The 50 Greatest British Actors, he was number 24 on The Comedians' Comedian, and he was number 8 on Britain's Favourite Comedian, Edmund Blackadder was number 3 on The 100 Greatest TV Characters, and he was number 3 on The World's Greatest Comedy Characters, and Blackadder (all four series) was number 2 on Britain's Best Sitcom. Underwhelming!"|Negative
"Several young Iranian women dress as boys and try to get into a World Cup qualifying match between Iran and Bahrain. When they're caught, they're penned in an area where the match remains within earshot, but out of sight. The prisoners plead to be let go, but rules are rules.<br /><br />Given the pedigree of its director, Jafar Panahi, it was disappointing to discover that Offside is a comedy, and a frequently forced one. In 1997's The Mirror, Panahi presents two versions of Iranian girlhood and leaves the audience to wonder which one is "real". In 2000's The Circle, several Iranian women step outside the system; their transgressions are different, but they all end up in the same tragic place.<br /><br />However, thinking now about Offside, it's hard to imagine it as anything other than a failed attempt at comedy, because the situation it presents is so obviously serious. As the women demand to know why they can't watch the soccer match and their captors struggle to answer, the only possible outcome is discomfort.<br /><br />What makes Offside most frustrating is that the young women are not portrayed as activists attacking the system. They are simply soccer fans and patriots, and despite the fact that they are clearly being treated unfairly, they never lose their focus on the match and the historic victory that is within their nation's grasp, which feels unrealistic and undermines the film's potential impact."|Negative
After seeing this film at the SF Independent Film Festival, I was disappointed and unimpressed. Jim McKay gave a talk (Q&A) about the film afterward which highlighted his problematic situation: how to get distribution for a film which poorly portrays minorities (women, non-whites) working on controversial issues (teen pregnancy, teen motherhood, racial identity, single-mother households), and how he, as a mid-thirties white male, struggled to write an authentic script on all of these topics. The multi-racial, multi-gendered audience of mostly-adults criticized the film's weak storyline, shallow characters, and unrealistic portrayal of "real teen life." Most of the teens had left the building--leading me to think this is a film best avoided by adults with kids, as it fails to provide a starting point for discussion. Hence, distribution questions--why would we want to get our hands on it? The Internet (retail) would be a poor path--this is a film that deserves to be buried, like "Pups" or other misguided modern teen films--and McKay seemed dismissive. As for his credits as a writer/director, McKay was insensitive and superficial in his work--failing to connect with the Crown Heights neighborhood in which the film is set, and struggling to work with actors to portray characters in their own vision of what they think should be--with the results being painfully unrealistic.|Negative
"This is one of the worst made-for-TV movies of all-time! Am I saying this because I'm a huge Silverstone critic? Partially, but even without her, I'd still despise it. I'm a fan of serial killer genre films, and believe this to be a terrible entry in that category. Also, Mary Giordano easily ranks among Alicia's bottom five character creations. Totally forgettable - like she doesn't exist at all. I'd never want her on my side if there was a mystery to be solved. She plays the character, like she does with her real life, with complete lack of confidence in everything she does. Seems fake, dishonest, unpleasant...just like she is in real life. So is that acting? Yes, indeed, she's sort of a rebel once again. This time she's not bad, she's too good and a bit afraid to do things that seem above the law. But she doesn't do things the normal teenager would do. Instead, she spends her time reading detective mags and solves crimes. A cliche abounds: she's sort of avenging her father's death, in a different way than vigilante-style. At the time, Alicia seemed to be playing the same characters: rebellious, seductive, without a parent, a loner. This happens here, too, but she's a bit nerdy this time around. That doesn't matter; she's still unbearable as a nerd. Avoid this at all costs, or else Giordano will be investigating why you wasted your time..."|Negative
""Soylent Green" is one of the worst and least compelling science fiction movies of the 70's and hardly convincing even by today's standards. Despite attempts at an apocalyptic touch and environmental premise, the film feels forced and unimaginative. This film's quality-level falls short of many contemporary SF flicks due to its weak cast and some tedious sequences that I personally consider forgettable. The New York of 2022 is a depressing place to be alive, with over-population, unemployment, an unhealthy climate and the total scarcity of every vital food product. The only form of food available is synthetic and distributed by the Soylent company. Charlton Heston (in a poor performance) plays a cop investigating the murder of one of Soylent's most eminent executives and he stumbles upon predictable and uninteresting revelations... The script is overly sentimental throughout and the climax is entirely predictable, with an atmosphere that fails to engage or unsettle. The riot-sequence is unconvincing and easily one of the most poorly executed moments in 70's cinema. Edward G. Robinson is unimpressive in his last role and there's a disappointing (and too modest) supportive role for Joseph Cotton ("Baron Blood", "The Abominable Dr. Phibes"). THIS is not Science-Fiction in my book: a clichéd and avoidable attempt at depicting humanity's future! No fancy space-ships with hairy monsters attacking our planet, but nothing of substance either."|Negative
"This game is disappointing and it has a plot that you could actually expect to see in the comics. Spider-man has been framed by a mysterious impostor. The city is being overrun by a strange gas, and symbiotes like those of Venom and Carnage are appearing all over the city. Who is behind these crimes? Could it be Doc Ock? Well he seems to have turned over a new leaf. Venom also does not seem to be involved as he is just ticked off that Spider-man has apparently cost him a rather good photo opportunity. Well cameos from other heroes and lots of villains later Spidey will unravel the mystery. The fighting is basic, too simplistic to be engaging, the fights with the bosses are rather dull. You get to collect comics, you run out of web and it is somewhat tedious traversing the city. Moreover, that is also a major weak point. The swinging is not at all great as all you do is hover through the city as Spider-man seemingly attachés his webs to the sky. You also do not have much maneuverability web-slinging either especially compared to a say Spider-man 2 movie video game. Unfortunately, it fails to make up for the rather bad swinging with the other elements especially the story. So be prepared to see Scorpion, Rhino, Venom, Mysterio, Doctor Octopus, and Carnage for one wild but ultimately unsatisfying ride."|Negative
"This film is about a man who has been too caught up with the accepted convention of success, trying to be ever upwardly mobile, working hard so that he could be proud of owning his own home. He assumes this is all there is to life until he accidentally takes up dancing, all because he wanted to get a closer look of a beautiful girl that he sees by the dance studio everyday while riding the subway on his way home.<br /><br />His was infatuated with her at first, going to the dance class just to idolize her, but he eventually lets himself go and gets himself into the dancing. It eventually becomes apparent to him that there is more to life than working yourself to death. There is a set of oddball characters also learning in the studio, but their attempts at humor fall flat and their interactions feel forced.<br /><br />There are supposed to be revelations of various characters, including the girl he initially admired, but these fail to add any real depth, showing their blemished past and struggles in a shallow and unconvincing manner.<br /><br />The dancing was also disappointing, with the big competition at the end feeling predictable and uninspired. While it's not the usual story where our underdog comes out on top by winning it, the downfalls, revelations, and redemption feel contrived and unsatisfying.<br /><br />All these elements make it a tedious and forgettable film to watch."|Negative
"The reason why I say this is because I wrote the screenplay and knew very little about it being made until I was asked to see the film. I wrote it for some producers who sold it on without telling me. Because Alan Dobie was a friend of mine, I got to hear about it. I had only written a first draft so I was understandably worried when I heard that it was on the floor. I asked Peter Collinson, through my agent, whether he might like me to do another draft. I also asked if I could I see my original script because I had lost it. I was told, too late. So I did the only thing I could do under the circumstances and took my name off. I had no idea what they might have done to my screenplay. Then I was invited to see the finished film. I was so disappointed that I very quickly asked to keep my name off. It's a poorly made piece, from a hurriedly written first draft, I expected to be asked to do much more work on it; perhaps if I had it wouldn't be so bad. I would love to see my original script again if anybody knows where it is? I would also prefer not to see the film again, I only saw it once in a little viewing theatre in Soho and that was more than enough."|Negative
"This group of English pros are a disappointment to watch. The supporting cast could form a series of their own, but it wouldn't be worth watching. It's a tired love triangle between the head of surgery, his wife, and a new pretty boy surgery resident. Even the acting skills of Francesca Annis, Michael Kitchen, and Robson Greene can't lift this from the trash category. The only positive is that it's hard to accept that the smoldering Francesca Annis would fall in love and actually marry Michael Kitchen, who like me, is hardly an international, or even a British sex symbol. You can readily understand why Robson Green would light her fire, with apologies to the "Doors". The guy who almost ruins the show with a poor "laid back" performance is Owen's father David Bradley. Watch him in "The Way We Live Now", in a completely different performance, to get an idea of his range. Daniela Nardini as Kitchen's secretary, sometime sex toy, is forgettable as the spurned mistress who makes Kitchen sorry he ever looked at her. Conor Mullen, and Julian Rhind-Tutt, as Green's sidekick surgery buddies as I've said could have their own series, but it wouldn't be any better. They are that bad. The whole thing is a waste of time, and I strongly advise against it, though I thank imdbman for letting the paying customers have their say in this fascinating venue."|Negative
"Abhay Deol meets the attractive Soha Ali Khan and greets her "Hello Sister"!!!. This sets the tone for a disappointing debut film by Shivam Nair. Soha, a middle class girl has run away from her home in Nainital and come to Delhi to marry her lover, Shayan Munshi. But Shyan doesn't turn up leaving Soha heartbroken & alone in the big bad world. . Abhay, the lower class next door guy turns protective towards the vulnerable Soha and helps her get a job & shelter in an old age home. Slowly an unconvincing romance blooms and Soha reluctantly agrees to marry Abhay. Then Shyan re-enters into Soha's life.<br /><br />A clumsily made film with a very predictable story, poorly shot in Delhi, revolves around the unremarkable Soha. This poorly crafted film has moments which will be quickly forgotten  the awkward first kiss & Abhay's swift apology; Abhay describing Soha as "class wali ladki" & hastily adding "that he doesn't love her"; his gifting a churidar to Soha & asking her out for a date.<br /><br />The music is mediocre & the background music distracting. In a scene where Soha rushes & embraces Abhay the sound track disappears. The stillness fails to convey both the awkwardness & tenderness of the relationship.<br /><br />The unsatisfying ending makes for a forgettable film, the memories of which will fade quickly.<br /><br />Not worth seeing I will rate it 3.5/10"|Negative
"For those of you who are not aware with the theme that Kusturica continues to explore intermittently in his films--the Western assault on traditional Serbian values--it will be impossible for you to understand his narratives. This continuous theme, expressed through fantasy and outrageous comedy as its vehicle, is one that Kusturica has elected to mandate. Since his disappointing work 'Underground', Kusturica's films' 'Black Cat White Cat', 'Life is a Miracle', and recently with 'Promise Me This', his slapstick, carnivalistic style fails to effectively underscore the 'westernization' of Balkan culture, its ambivalent arrival and assault on the traditional idiom. In the case of 'Promise Me This', the paradoxical world of city (urban space) and village (traditional idiom) space are contrasted, but in a heavy-handed manner. The world of the city reflects western attributes that have ensconced the spatial and temporal setting; organized crime, sexual exploitation, a ruptured sense of identity and vehement disregard for traditional values--as expressed toward the young kid--villager. The end of the film further exemplifies this notion as we observe a funeral mass and wedding on a one-way dirt road. They are on a collision coarse; appropriately, the wedding, which represents the lifeline and pulse of the village, i.e. traditional values, are about to collide with the funeral mourners, exemplifying the death of tradition within this context. Yet Kusturica clumsily examines this theme through his own unique, stylistic singularity. With his outrageous and flamboyant style serving as a distracting vehicle in its portrayal."|Negative
"Soap Opera about a small town married woman (Kay Francis) who works at the local newsstand, performs as leading lady in her local playhouse, but dreams of becoming a star on Broadway. When a famous actor who is a ham, a windbag, and a womanizer to boot, arrives in town she visits him in his room with dreams of him giving her tips to stardom - he pretends his valet is his "manager" tricking her into believing she has all it takes but "experience" to become a big star. Her husband finds out and punches the guy resulting in the actor's unexpected death - which leads to a murder trial and even more unexpected: a life prison sentence for hubby. Next thing you know she's joined a traveling Burlesque show in hopes of one day making it to Broadway and making enough money to get her man's freedom - all the while her baby is sleeping in a trunk!<br /><br />This film has a rather convoluted and unbelievable plot, which is made even more tiresome by the excessive melodramatic music that constantly tries to manipulate the viewer's emotions. Unfortunately, even Kay Francis's performance can't save this film. Her acting, while emotional, feels forced and over-the-top. The supporting cast, including Minna Gombell as the older burlesque performer, fails to add any depth to the shallow characters. Not worth seeing, even for Kay Francis fans."|Negative
"Woody Allen's second movie set in London. Tha Tarot Card murderer is killing prostitutes in London. Aspiring journalist Sondra Pransky (Scarlett Johansson) gets a tip that he may be Lord Peter Lyman (Hugh Jackman). She starts to romance him but quickly falls in love. She's helped by stage magician Sid Waterman (Woody Allen) who doesn't like what he sees.<br /><br />I dislike this even more than the overrated "Match Point" from last year. Although it was shorter, it dragged and felt tedious. The plot is old and failed to entertain me, leaving me bored until the very end. It's not really a comedy but a mystery with a few weak comedic lines (all from Allen, unfortunately). It's one of Allen's worst and far below his best work.<br /><br />The acting is, for the most part, disappointing. Allen is bad and he's played this character a million times before, making it even more tiresome. Johansson and Jackman are just mediocre--they look fantastic but give two unconvincing performances. Also Allen (surprisingly) fails to work on their sex appeal--there is a sequence where they're both in their bathing suits that feels gratuitous and unnecessary. The only real positive is that Allen still seems unsure on how to shoot London. He's not as off as he was on "Match Point" though--maybe he'll just get better as he goes along.<br /><br />Not worth seeing. I give it a 3."|Negative
"For those of you who have read Rohinton Mistry's highly respected novel, this film will likely disappoint you, due to its unfaithful adaptation. With the exception of one minor subplot, Sturla Gunnarson's feature film debut fails to capture the essence of the book (despite attempting to recreate it line by line).<br /><br />For those of you who have not read the novel, this movie might be a little tricky. It is certainly not a large cinematic drama story. Instead it has a strong element of realism to it, which unfortunately works against it. The best way to describe Such a Long Journey to movie fans would be to say that it is a small scale, Hindu version of 'Fiddler On The Roof', but lacking the charm and emotional depth. Instead of a Jewish/Russian milkman, the protagonist Gustad Noble is a banker in 1970's Bombay during the time of the Muslim/Hindi war with Pakistan. He is forced to deal with a number of unexpected problems in his life, including his sick daughter, his individualist eldest son, a distant friend who gets him involved with some dirty money, and an unhealthy neighborhood. The Ending is not a happy one, nor is it a sad one, but that is essentially what realism involves, leaving the viewer unsatisfied. <br /><br />Such a Long Journey is a disappointing and forgettable movie, but if you want to see it, then good luck finding it. Unlike the novel, it has received very little release, which is perhaps for the best."|Negative
"I have not read the novel, though I understand that this is somewhat different from it; the fact that I rather disliked this, coupled with the fact that this really is not my genre, leads me to the decision of not pursuing reading the book. Having not read a single word of Austen's writing, I really can't compare this to any of her work. What I can say is that almost every line of dialog in this is forced, contrived, and poorly-delivered, as well as the biggest source of frustration in this. This made me cringe a lot, with awkward British and verbal material. Every acting performance is off-key, and Paltrow completely misses the mark in the role of a kind matchmaker. The characters are poorly-written, unbelievable and inconsistent. I found most of them extremely irritating, and while I think that at least some of that was meant to be funny, it tended to get repeated excessively, and it honestly wasn't amusing the first time they appeared. The editing and cinematography are mediocre, and everything looks utterly bland. Plot and pacing are terrible, you're constantly bored. It does end in a *really* obvious manner, but maybe that's what the audience of these prefer. I can't claim that this entertained me, it failed to do so from start to finish, and I'd never watch it again. There is brief language in this. I cannot recommend this to any fan of romance stories. 3/10"|Negative
"Sort of like a very primitive episode of "General Hospital" set in a natal ward (and one for tough cases at that), this slow-moving programmer has an unsatisfying emotional impact -- mainly because Eric Linden, as the distraught young husband in the main plot, is so unconvincingly a wreck, and with little good reason. His expectant wife, Loretta Young, is brought to the ward at the beginning of a 20-year prison sentence for offing a lecher who probably had it coming to him; Ms. Young, as always, doesn't do anything to disinvite audience sympathy, and she's a little too good to be true, though unsympathetic and unpleasant to look at, of course. Her difficult pregnancy and relationships with the other girls of the ward form the heart of the movie, and the outcome -- not an entirely happy one -- feels forced. Aline MacMahon, "one of the cinema's few perfect actresses," in the apt words of film historian David Thomson, fails to exude warmth and authority as the head nurse, and Glenda Farrell, as a none-too-willing new mom of twins, gets to croon "Frankie and Johnny" as a drunken lullaby, which falls flat. Frank McHugh figures in another subplot, and he fails to show more range than Warners usually permitted him. It's scaled and paced poorly, and Linden's expectant-dad panic fails to stay with you -- this sort of part was often played for laughs, but he's an unconvincing young kid in trouble, and not at all persuasive."|Negative
"Sure, it's a 50's drive-in special, and that's exactly what it feels like - dated and unimpressive. In my little book, there are a number of clumsy touches with awkward attempts at humor. Catch the redoubtable Mrs. Porter who's supposed to keep an eye on the doc's place. She not only overacts in her scene, but darn near ruins the whole movie. And where did those indie producers come up with the bucks to film in color? A poor decision, since the blob would have been more menacing in b&w. Yes, the result is ragged around the edges as the number of goofs illustrate. And particularly with the teens, the non-Hollywood cast performs poorly. Then too, the byplay among hot-rodders and cops comes across as forced and irritating. Pretty disappointing for a couple of directors more at home in a pulpit than on a sound stage. Apparently, they wanted to portray teens in a positive light at a time when the screen was filled with "juvenile delinquents". Then again, the 27-year old McQueen hardly qualifies in the age department, and fails to convincingly portray the hot-rodder attitude. The movie was inexplicably a hit at the time, helped along, no doubt, by the catchy title tune that got a lot of radio play. And with the unfortunate final effects, the movie is still a chore to sit through, drive-in or no drive-in. Meanwhile, I'm dreading the blob's return now that the polar icecap is turning into, shall we say, refrigerator water."|Negative
"A disappointing and unconvincing drama about the hunt for the notorious Russian serial killer Andrea Chikatilo. Lackluster performance from Stephen Rea as the forensic scientist put in charge of the investigation, who finds the biggest obstacle to his progress is the Russian government, in particular the old communist party members who want to maintain a closed society.<br /><br />The film has an underlying theme about the decline of the communist society, and progress in the hunt for the killer is reflected by progress in social and political change in Russia, which is heavy-handedly put across. There is a conflict of old ways and new ways, and these are represented by the two viewpoints of Rea's superior (played by Donald Sutherland), and Rea himself . These are at first polarised, with Sutherland 'high' in system looking down, and Rea 'low' on the ground, looking up. However, they have a common cause  to catch the serial killer.<br /><br />Throughout the film the relationship between these two develops, and the tension gradually eases until at the end of the movie Rea and Sutherland and Rea and Sutherland have mutual respect for each other, the killer is caught, and Glasnost symbolically comes. Weak script.<br /><br />Further disappointments come from Sutherland's performance, which is unconvincing and unsympathetic, Jeffrey DeMunn as the killer whom we neither despise nor understand, and Max Von Sydow, who is thoroughly unbelievable as the humble psychologist who risks his reputation to help."|Negative
"There's something unconvincing and strangely implausible about this episode. From the very beginning, an atmosphere of tedium is created by the knowledge that a certain planet is going to explode within a few hours. Kirk, Spock and McCoy have beamed down to evacuate the inhabitants, all of whom seem to have left already for parts unknown, except for an elderly librarian.<br /><br />The librarian's polite but cryptic advice about where all the citizens have gone to is interrupted by a crisis in which all three Enterprise crew members find themselves unexpectedly hurled into different eras of the planet's past. Kirk finds himself in a time period resembling 17th Century England, while Spock and McCoy are stranded in a desolate, frozen waste. <br /><br />The intercutting between the two stories, and the different hazardous situations the men find themselves in is poorly handled, with return to the present an unknown chance, while the minutes are counting down to the planet's explosion. <br /><br />Unimaginative writing and mediocre acting characterize this episode, with a lackluster performance by Mariette Hartley as a woman exiled to the Ice Age, and Ian Wolfe as the urbane Librarian. Somewhat reminiscent of the classic episode City On The Edge of Forever, this time travel story is a dull and disappointing finale to the series, which concluded one episode later. This has to be one of the worst of the whole series, especially unsurprising given the generally lesser quality of the third season overall."|Negative
"I've seen this movie when I was young, and I remembered it as one of the first films I have truly disliked that was not an action movie or a comedy. So, in my later years I decided to watch it again and see if it was just a bad memory or was there really something lacking in that movie. To my disappointment, the movie lived down to my every expectation. It's a terrible movie. Emotionally flat, forced jokes, forgettable songs (which actually explains why I did not remember it was a musical) and all in all a waste of my time. I was disappointed because the last movies from my childhood that I have revisited at least passed my minimal demands of a decent movie and yet this movie, which I first saw in the second grade, left me cold today just like it did then. Maybe that's because my dog died recently and maybe not, but the important thing is that it failed to make me feel, and that's why filmmakers make films (that and the money, of course). Yes, there are continuity glitches. Yes, the script has holes, and it does matter. The movie itself is boring and dumb. So don't be fooled by overly optimistic people who always look for the good things in life, because nothing is perfect, and this movie gets a 1 not because it's the worst ever made. It gets 1 simply because it failed to make me feel."|Negative
"I found 'Still Crazy' to be disappointingly dull, and not even those of us who lived through that raucous era of late '60s, early '70s rock could enjoy it. My 15 year old daughter watches it with me every time I reluctantly drag out the DVD (unfortunately, it's been three times) and she dislikes it too.<br /><br />It is a truly misguided, forced, and unfunny nod to the era, and every actor misses their mark. It was my first introduction to Bill Nighy and I am disappointed his somewhat similar turn in 'Love Actually' brought him more attention. Bruce Robinson was unconvincing as Brian, failing to bring life to what became a caricature of the drug-damaged rocker stereotype. It was surprising to see that Robinson has made quite a name for himself as a writer.<br /><br />I live in Sherman Oaks, California, and after the first time I saw the movie I bumped into Billy Connolly at the local mall (he lived here at the time) and told him it was one of my five least favorite films of all time. He invited me to sit down at the food court with him and we discussed the movie's shortcomings for some time. We even talked of the idea of an American-oriented remake before wisely dismissing that. Why bother remaking such a poor original?<br /><br />My only problem with 'Still Crazy' is that it wasn't hugely panned in theaters and too many people have been subjected to this disappointing experience."|Negative
"Mario is invited to Princess Peach's castle for cake. When Mario gets there, he finds out that Bowser has kidnapped her! Mario must save the day again. Unlike the 2-D games, Mario can explore anything he wants to. He can just roam around, climb trees trying to look for 1-Ups, find secrets in levels, and more. You can spend four hours in one level. No time limits. There are 16 worlds, with a number of stages, and there are star doors, which you need a certain number of stars to get into. Once you get in these star doors, you must go through a stage and fight Bowser at the end of the stage. To get to certain worlds, you need a number of stars to get in. You enter the world by going through a painting. There is so much stuff to do and so many hours of gameplay, I don't see how anyone could enjoy this game. It's tedious. This launch title is the game that made gamers question if the N64 would have a good life. Every 3D plat-form game we know of has something in common with SM64, unfortunately. Banjo Kazooie and Banjo Tooie are examples that are commonly used. Super Mario 64 is one of the most overrated games in the history of 3D games. 2 out of 10. If you have an N64, avoid this game. It's hard to find used, because everyone's trying to sell this disappointment for 5 bucks at the pawn shop. A dismal 2."|Negative
"I rented this film because of my interest in American history, and especially the somewhat weird story of the Mormons. This movie fails to make sense out of how Joseph Smith could turn his "vision" into a major world religion. It first focuses on the troubles the Mormons had in their settlement at Navuoo, Illinois. It portrays the trial of Joseph Smith. Within the course of that trial, Brigham Young stands up to tell of his conversion to Mormonism, and of his belief in the spiritual message of Smith. Then Smith is assassinated, and Young must deal with his own doubts about whether he has been chosen to lead the Mormons to a new land. Despite his grave doubts, he perseveres, and finally has a vision (that Utah is the place for his colony) that gives him confidence in the rightness of his leadership. Later, as crops are destroyed by crickets, he again doubts that he has truly been chosen--however, a miracle occurs, which cements his place in history.<br /><br />I found the performances to be unconvincing, and the story to be implausible and dull. I would love to know whether Mormons believe that this is an accurate portrayal. Polygamy is a part of the story, but the reasons why this is central to LDS are not raised. The issue is not emphasized.<br /><br />People are right to stay away from this movie because of its religious subject-matter, and despite its great cast, it will struggle to hold your interest throughout."|Negative
"Inspector "Dirty" Harry Callahan once again angers his superiors with his maverick approach to police work. Refusing to take a vacation he is given a simple case which takes him outside of San Francisco. However, he soon discovers a link between a recent murder in the city and a murder outside of the city, which leads him to the trail of a revenge killer.<br /><br />As an entry in the Dirty Harry franchise the film starts with some disappointing moments, including the overused "Go ahead, make my day" line that Eastwood delivers unconvincingly through clenched teeth before clumsily foiling a robbery. It's not very impressive and falls short of what fans expect from him. The film then shifts gears and focuses on the mysterious revenge killer. The problem is that this killer isn't characterized well, and neither is Harry. This really detracts from the presence of the main character who used to rule his previous film appearances with, pardon the pun, Magnum Force.<br /><br />The new storyline attempts to draw parallels to Harry's own unorthodox methods and give his character dramatic depth, but it fails to do so convincingly, leaving fans who were looking for another badass Harry outing deeply disappointed. A lackluster climax ends the film on a dull note, making it a poor movie even for fans. --- 3/10<br /><br />Rated R for violence and a rape scene"|Negative
"Joe Don Baker is one of a handful of actors who is often worse than his material, and almost always over appreciated. He's been in a ton of films either as a heavy or a hero, and has the type of weak, inconsistent presence that Wallace Beery did half a century before him. Baker can't deliver material that would sound ridiculous coming out of another actor, and that's what's so disappointing about him. He never seems to mean what he's saying, regardless of how cliché, obvious or silly, which puts him in a league with lesser actors. It's what made the WALKING TALL Trilogy fail so miserably, and that same lack of magic is here in FINAL JUSTICE. This was a substantial flop in theaters and on video in the 80s, and it has aged poorly compared to many of the perhaps better known action flicks of the era. By moving the action from Texas to Europe, there's a jarring quality that distracts you from the action on screen. To be honest, I've always disliked the films of Greydon Clark, who is a clumsy director in the same vein as 1970s Clint Eastwood, and this is one of his worst. FINAL JUSTICE is one of the forgotten disasters of the late 80s, similar to MAN ON FIRE in its lack of true grit and violence. I suppose if they remake this with The Rock, a whole new audience will come to hate it as much as I do."|Negative
"i know technically this isn't the greatest TV show ever,i mean it was shot on video and its limitations show in both the audio and visual aspect of it.the acting can at time be also a little crumby.and,i hate this show so much.it failed to scare me when it first aired in 1988.of course it wouldn't, i was 5 years old.but i recently purchased the DVD of the first 3 episodes,which unfortunately i hear is now deleted.and i also heard warner's aren't going to release any more due to the first DVD's bad sales.also the TV show didn't have the same feel as the movies,in fact i thought it had a less sinister tone.even though the colour palette is similar to nightmare on elm street 4(both that film and the TV show were made the same year),this has more of a comedic tone whereas the films were progressively getting more and more sardonic and jokey.not a good thing,i dislike freddy as the clown wise cracker.but i think that was the weakness of this TV show,you didn't have freddy popping up every minutes cracking a joke before and after he kills somebody.in fact this has more of a bland feel to it,reinforced by the soft focus of the lense.im not sure if its deliberate on the part of the shows creators or just to the limitations of being shot on video. i dislike this show,and even taken not as a companion piece to the movies it's very disappointing.much worse than anything on TV today."|Negative
"Illudere (to delude) comes from Latin verb 'ludere' (to play), so you're warned about the 'spy game' as a cruel and yet elaborate and intelligent (!) activity stemmin' from a complex and as it may appear absurd and vain personal history, whatever it may be; and yet I feel disinterested by the mechanism of treason and loyalty, the raw material of any relationship, from the personal to the social; after, many years ago, I was UNABLE to finish the book it was a disappointment! At the beginning I was so bored and the surprising style of the writing did nothing to change that (I really started to DISLIKE Le Carre after that novel). The main character is not wavering at all: he has made a choice to redeem his weakness by following the path of faith to friendship and love, or is he not? After this novel you can clearly understand the darker version of Green's 'Our Man in Havana' wrote by LeCarre with 'The Tailor of Panama'; there is no game left, there it ends either in tragedy or in a grotesque comical way, or both. There is no Smiley here to upheld decent human qualities in 'the service', or at least there is no point to introduce him in this case. The BBC has done a subpar work with these series from LeCarre's novels: the actors are mediocre, as are the locations and sets; of course the script here is poorly adapted. Be warned though, even if someone may find it laughable, the after taste IS unpleasant."|Negative
"Charles Boyer is supposed to be Spanish, and he's come to London to buy coal in "Confidential Agent," a 1945 film also starring Lauren Bacall, Katina Paxinou, Peter Lorre, Dan Seymour, and Wanda Hendrix. Boyer is Luis Denard, and everyone is out to stop him except Bacall. His papers are stolen, he's accused of murder but he's determined to get coal for his people so that they can fight the Fascists.<br /><br />This film has its bad and not so bad points. It rates low for atmosphere and for suspense, and it is hardly entertaining. Bacall is surprisingly plain, Boyer is unpassionate, Paxinou is unconvincing, Lorre is bland, Hendrix inadequately pathetic, and Seymour disappointingly mediocre.<br /><br />The not so bad points: Bacall is supposed to be English, and Boyer Spanish. Uh, no. Boyer is terrible in his role even with the wrong accent, and Bacall is 100% American, not of the British upper class. The two have no chemistry. Conclusion: Bacall is completely miscast. Her acting isn't up to snuff either; she's worse here than in other films. And she's not even an astonishing looking woman, so little can be forgiven.<br /><br />Paxinou is nearly under-acting and forgettable. Dan Seymour almost ruins the entire film as a hotel guest who studies human nature. It's a poor part and his performance is flawed, while some of the direction of the other actors isn't as bad. This was definitely a case of no small parts, only small actors. Seymour was a small actor.<br /><br />Definitely not worth seeing even with its few redeeming qualities."|Negative
"I am only 11 years old but I discovered Full House when I was about five and watched it constantly until I was seven. Then I grew older and figured Full House could wait and that I had "more important" things to do. Plus there was also the fact that my younger brother who watched it faithfully with me for those two years started to dislike it thinking it too "girly." <br /><br />Then I realized every afternoon at five it was on 23 and I once again became addicted to it. Full House has made me cringe and roll my eyes. It's made me realize how unrealistic and annoying it would be if our world was like the world of Full House plus a mom. I have heard people say Full House is cheesy and unbelievable. And they're absolutely right: three girls whose mom was killed by a drunk driver. The sisters fight and get their feelings hurt. The three men who live with the girls can get into bickers at times. It's all so contrived and poorly executed. <br /><br />If anything the show has brought me down when I'm up and made me feel even worse when I thought I was at the point of complete misery. I have groaned in frustration at the show and gained a massive dislike for Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen. (Of course Hilary Duff has now taken that spot but they were literally the most annoying babies I have ever seen. They are terrible actresses and seem to be very fake people.)|Negative
"The film is based on Kipling's overused lines that inspire Hollywood's most overrated movie of 1939. Out of the monotonous rhythm of Kipling's most famous 85 lines rises a picture that will become known as the one great disappointment of the year. Overwhelming on the score of its armies in battle, its war elephants, its bandit hordes, its terror temples Thugs and mystic mountains of India. The picture is excessive in its scope and sweep, is dull in thrill and action but worst of all in the life it fails to breathe through three (Gary Grant, Victor McLagen and Douglas Fairbanks Jr) unconvincing, reckless, swaggering sons of the thundering gunfighters men who stumble through its mighty scenes lacking flesh and blood of high adventure. It's a dishonest film of it all that makes Gunga Din a tedious experience in entertainment. Joan Fontaine's performance is wasted against the valiant sergeants three. The romance between Fontaine and Fairbanks Jr fizzles through dangerous days and nights of terror in a land where anything can happen. The motion picture has clichés from a thousand movies plundered for one mighty bore. It's a contrived, sluggish and far-fetched adventure with the bland and predictable heroes who rise from the storied mystery of India and stumble through the screen with the lackluster, forced, and shallow life-thunder of men who fight without conviction and love without passion. The picture is misinterpreted by the uninspired Gary Grant who rounded up hundred villains Thugs and the mean Guru (Eduardo Ciannelli), Grant unconvincingly shouts: You're under arrest!. Besides is the irritating water man, Sam Jaffe, who regiment colonel (Montagu Love) says of him: You're a worse man than I am, Gunga Din!"|Negative
"Marlene Dietrich and Charles Boyer give lackluster performances in this beautiful but empty film. The irony is that Dietrich plays a woman with a beautiful but empty life. Truly gorgeous cinematography and sets, and yes Dietrich's bottomless trunk of clothes are also fabulous. She look great; Boyer looks young and trim.<br /><br />Story of a woman seeking meaning and an ex-priest seeking life seems stale, and set against such unreal sets and skies it fails to work, despite the two stars, the terrific score by Max Steiner, and a good supporting cast. The film runs like 76 minutes and seems badly edited, plus certain characters just appear or disappear.<br /><br />Joseph Schildkraut is unfunny as the Arab guide, C. Aubrey Smith is the old priest, Lucile Watson the mother superior, Tilly Losch the dancer, John Carradine the diviner, and Basil Rathbone plays.... well I'm not sure. He just rides in from the desert and spoils everything! As others have noted, John Gilbert was slated to star with Dietrich. I can't help but think he would have been terrible. The role of world-weary Boris would have been unsuitable for the great Gilbert. And after the success of Queen Christina (with Garbo), his career might have gotten back on track.<br /><br />I can't think of any other 30s film Dietrich did in color. She looks great and wears some terrific clothes. My favorite is the Valentino as The Shiek-like outfit she wears by the pool.<br /><br />Certainly not worth a look, despite the lush sets and color and the two great stars."|Negative
"New York playwright Michael Caine (as Sidney Bruhl) is 46-years-old and fading fast; as the film opens, Mr. Caine's latest play flops on Broadway. TV reviewers poke fun at Caine, and he gets drunk. Passing out on the Long Island Railroad lands Caine in Montauk, instead of his residence in East Hampton. Finally arriving home, Caine is comforted by tightly-attired wife Dyan Cannon (as Myra), an unfortunately high-strung heart patient. There, Caine and Ms. Cannon discuss a new play called "Deathtrap", written by hunky young Christopher Reeve (as Clifford "Cliff" Anderson), one of Caine's former students. The couple believe Mr. Reeve's "Deathtrap" is the hit needed to revive Caine's career.<br /><br />"The Trap Is Set For A Disappointingly Predictable Who'll-Do-It." <br /><br />Directed by Sidney Lumet, Ira Levin's long-running Broadway hit falls flat in its transition from stage to screen. The cast is underwhelming and the story's twists are predictable. One thing that particularly did not work was the curtain call ending; it feels out of place and awkward on film. "Deathtrap" is a tedious film to watch again; the performances are lackluster - and the greeting Reeve gives Caine at the East Hampton train station feels forced and unnatural. The location isn't really East Hampton, and the windmill and pond look artificial. And, the much ballyhooed love scene is disappointingly tepid. Unfortunately, even though the play was good, a talented director managed to ruin it. Mr. Lumet disappoints.<br /><br />******** Deathtrap (3/19/82) Sidney Lumet ~ Michael Caine, Christopher Reeve, Dyan Cannon, Irene Worth"|Negative
"This film lacks the one ingredient that all revenge movies should have and that is true emotion. It fails to evoke sorrow, love, laughter, or anger. From start to finish this film is incredibly dull. The plot on paper sounds like the usual rubbish that is mostly thrown in the faces of the audiences, and unfortunately, that's exactly what it is. Washington's performance is disappointing.<br /><br />The plot in a nutshell: man suffers from depression, a young girl brings life into him, kids gets kidnap, man wants revenge. It doesn't sound like anything special, and it isn't. It's far inferior to other similar films out there. For instance, TAKEN is a similar film but when you compare them both, MAN ON FIRE loses hands down. The characters are unengaging and everyone puts in a mediocre performance, and the directing is poor. Mexico City feels lifeless, it doesn't look or smell like Mexico City at all. Everything is portrayed poorly. The style of direction was something I disliked and brought out the worst of Mexico City<br /><br />This is one of those films you'll never want to watch again or a film that you'll warn your family and friends against watching. From start to finish you are frustrated with the main protagonist, making it a tedious journey. There's not enough action to keep you interested, there's not enough character development to satisfy you, and then there's Washington to bring a frown to your face. Avoid this film, you'll be disappointed"|Negative
"I suppose I always felt that Hotel du Nord was studio-bound, the movement of people cars and camera were just too effortlessly smooth and stagey to have been filmed on location. This is a major problem - it's an overrated and artificial composition from Marcel Carne. The plot seems a bit choppy at times, as if they were making it up as they went along, and because it is unpredictable, it fails to hold the attention to the bitter end. The money shots when the 2 lovers are alone in their room are saddled with some rather stilted dialogue, and it's all so poorly executed that any inanity becomes glaringly obvious. Are these 2 young people symbols of a cancerous hopelessness in pre-War France or simply idiots? Suicide pacts are fairly common; if the suicidees are young and healthy with their lives before them untrammelled would you think anything other than that they were just misguided fools?<br /><br />Arletty played the part of prostitute poorly - she kept that zipper on her dress busy throughout anyway! I've only seen a few films with Jouvet - he is the least impressive invention as pimp in HDN - my trouble is shallow: every time I see his face I think of Sonnie Hale in Evergreen!<br /><br />A remarkably dull, poorly acted and photographed film with so much happening it needs a few viewings to make any sense of it. Annabella and Aumont made an exceptionally unappealing couple; Francois (Heurtebise) Perier in his 2nd film had a small annoying part as a gay man. All in all: disappointing."|Negative
"Updated from a previous comment. The overrated Marion Davies fails to show her comedic chops in this late (1928) silent comedy that also features the underwhelming William Haines. Davies plays a hick from Georgia who clumsily crashes Hollywood with help from Haines, a bit player in crude comedies. They appear together in cheap, forgettable comedies until Marion is inexplicably "discovered" and becomes an undeserving dramatic star.<br /><br />A poor attempt at lampooning Hollywood and its pretensions. Davies & Haines are a mismatched team, and the guest shots from the likes of Charlie Chaplin, Douglas Fairbanks, William S. Hart, John Gilbert, Elinor Glyn, Norma Talmadge, Mae Murray, Rod LaRocque, Leatrice Joy, Dorothy Sebastian, Estelle Taylor, Louella Parsons, Renee Adoree, Aileen Pringle, and Marion Davies (you have to see it) are forced and awkward. A disappointment for any serious film buff or for anyone interested in the justly-maligned Marion Davies! Dell Henderson plays the father. Polly Moran is a maid. Paul Ralli is the slimy leading man.<br /><br />SHOW PEOPLE was said to have used the career of Gloria Swanson as its model (I think Mae Murray is closer). Davies and Swanson were friends. But this film's story does parallel the rise of Swanson from one-reel Mack Sennett comedies with Charlie Chaplin to STAR in Cecil B. DeMille films of the late teens and early 20s.<br /><br />Davies and Haines were huge MGM stars and friends. It's fortunate that MGM never teamed them up in a talkie. They're terrible together! An unconvincing romance and weak spoof of early Hollywood. Greta Garbo and Bebe Daniels are mentioned but do not appear."|Negative
"I hadn't seen the restored, or any version for that matter, of "Baby Face" with Barbara Stanwyck till I caught it on TCM. What a disappointing movie! In a nutshell Lily lives in a speakeasy, she's been pimped out by her own Father since she was 14! Then his still blows up and he's killed leaving Lily (Stanwyck) alone cept for her black maid Chico, played blandly by Theresa Harris. Lily leaves for the big city ( New York) deciding to use her sex to get to the top. She does this in a distasteful manner!<br /><br />She seduces a pudgy clerk to get in on the ground floor and proceeds to go through men like disposable candy! One dumps his fiancée and kills his near father-in-law, also Lily's sugar-daddy, then commits suicide! Lily barely blinks! Stanwyck is unconvincing as a girl who really doesn't know what love is.<br /><br />Then in Paris, she falls for Courtland, played by George Brent, they marry, but when he's in deep financial straights, she bolts. Nearly free with Chico and a half-million, she realizes she loved Court! Lily races to find him, but will she be too late? <br /><br />This is pre-code Hollywood at its worst. Stanwyck is mediocre and the look and music in the film are jarring. This reminded me of "Original Sin" with Angelina Jolie, another justifiably ignored flick with an amoral woman, those who disliked that films ultra-romantic leanings, will not like Baby Face any better, those with belief in sex, love and power, will hate it. Not recommended! Avoid it!"|Negative
"A Matter of Life and Death, what can you really say that would properly convey the disappointment and mediocrity of this film. Powell and Pressburger's visual imagination falls flat, with every frame filled with unimaginative compositions. The switches between the bold colours of "the real world" to the stark black and white of heaven is confusing, failing to show us visually any meaningful contrast. The final court scene is also lackluster, as the judge and jury descend the stairway to heaven to hold court over Peter (David Niven)'s operation. <br /><br />The performances are largely forgettable (Roger Livesey being particularly unremarkable), and the romantic energy of the film is forced, I've seen far more romantic films than this. A Matter of Life and Death attempts to be about the power of love and the importance of life, but fails to convey these themes effectively. Jack Cardiff's cinematography is uninspired, the way he lights Kim Hunter's face does little to enhance her appearance, and he even manages to make exciting things such as a game of table tennis look dull. The sound design is also unremarkable; the way the sound mutes at vital points was a decision that feels dated and out of place<br /><br />This is a forgettable film that can diminish one's faith in cinema, overhyped on its initial release and by today's audiences, and one of my least favorites, which is why I give this film a 2/10, in a word - Disappointing."|Negative
"Sure it was well shot and made, very well shot and made! And the story was wonderfully crafted. The portrayal of Lincoln was even stronger. Henry Fonda was excellent and the character he played was captivating. Lincoln as a wise-cracking smart aleck with a unique approach to the law and the court was refreshing. I mean, who wouldn't love this version of Honest Abe? I mean come on, "I'll just call you Jackass then"???? I understand that Ford was going for great funny hero guy and I absolutely loved this portrayal. He bends the rules in sports, talks with charming simplicity, and has his own unconventional way in the courtroom. How could I not take this seriously?<br /><br />The twist was even more brilliant. I mean come on! That was just ingenious. The whole story seemed like it was crafted by a creative genius with a vivid imagination. Saying that I loved it, it was very entertaining and made me laugh on several occasions so I can't say it's anything but a fantastic film. In fact I must say that I must say it's excellent, anything that entertains me and makes me laugh this much has to be good, and this vivid and playful story was just so delightfully ridiculous that I can totally understand how anyone could consider it great.<br /><br />I have no idea how historically accurate this film was but if any of it was true I would really have to applaud the filmmakers for their creative interpretation."|Negative
"It takes a Serbian or at least a Balkan familiarity to understand and appreciate many of the situations, characters and jokes of 'Zavet' as well as of many other films of Kusturica. See for example the opening scenes, with the remote village in the Serbian mountains, with the low-tech devices that defend the integrity and way of life of the inhabitants, the nostalgia for the good days of the Communist rule, and the awakening of the young brat watching his nude teacher at the sounds of the Soviet hymn. Kusturica not only tries to depart from the tragic history of Serbia described in his previous movies, but creates a whole world of himself in the process.<br /><br />This is not a political film or not an explicit political film in any case. However, it fails to be an entertaining film. Kusturica creates a set of characters that we struggle to care about. Music plays an active role in this film same as in all his other movies, but it feels out of place here. His style is direct and grotesque, we now what he feels about his characters but we often find ourselves disagreeing. The space he develops melds present, history and magic, and the colours seem to be of a Douanier Rousseau of modern cinema, yet it all feels forced and artificial.<br /><br />This is far from a perfect film. The principal flaw is the length, some editing and shortening would have been essential, as the director seems to have run out of ideas early on and repetitions abound. It is one of the least engaging, tedious, and emotionally flat films that I have seen lately."|Negative
"I caught this film late on a sat night/ Sunday morning with my brother. We had been drinking. This is one of the most entertaining films I have ever seen. From the 'luxury' ocean liner actually being a 'roll on, roll off' ferry, complete with cast iron everything to the doors with adhesive stickers saying staff, then seeing the same door being used for something else in another scene - this film is brilliantly quirky!! The continuity is so creatively unconventional you can't help but be amused, it surprises you with its unexpected twists. In the final scene he jumps off a life boat with the ferry in the distance. Cut to his son and new girlfriend (The ships PR director who knows kung-fu and used to be in the police but was dismissed for doing things her way - true)on the ferry going very fast away from the explosion. ......Then the dad is there hugging them. It's charmingly absurd! Who cares, it's magic. There is not one dull moment in this film. The casino is amusingly compact, the size of a large bedroom with one casino table. When being chased by the villains there is only One place to hide, you've guessed it. Enter the villains who, instead of checking under the One table, proceed to shoot up four fruit machines and a little corner bar (a corner bar in the casino - fantastic). They walk straight past the only hiding place thus allowing our Casper to get around them and 'take them out' in a hilariously improbable sequence.<br /><br />Get some mates over, get a few drinks in, put this film on and enjoy the unintentional comedy gold."|Negative
Unlike many other films, which are disturbing either by dint of their naked unpleasantness (Man Bites Dog) or their sheer violence (most Peckinpah films), Deliverance fails to shock or engage due to its lack of plausibility. While the buggery scene is straightforward in its unpleasantness, the film's effect is diminished by its sluggish build-up and the unconvincing sense of isolation surrounding the four leads, both before and after everything starts to go wrong. The moment when the canoes pass under the child on the bridge, who does not even acknowledge the men he had earlier played music with, let alone show any sign of human affection towards them, falls flat and fails to create any tension. The film struggles to maintain interest throughout the canoe trip, and fizzles out even after the final credits - the ending fails to make the significance of the characters' ordeals feel real or impactful. The movie's lack of believability is further hindered by the underwhelming performances of the leads, particularly Ned Beatty and Jon Voight as the victim and reluctant hero respectively. Burt Reynolds, too, delivers a forgettable performance. The film's cultural influence is negligible, with few people understanding a reference to 'banjo territory' - perhaps only Get Carter has done such an ineffective job on a region's portrayal. I can think of countless movies which left a more lasting impression after they had finished - the oppressive atmosphere of Se7en is a far superior example. Although it tries to be excellent, Deliverance fails to become a classic because it lacks any unique qualities - it is derivative and forgettable.|Negative
"Hey Babu Riba" is a film about a young woman, Mariana (nicknamed "Esther" after a famous American movie star), and four young men, Glenn, Sacha, Kicha, and Pop, all perhaps 15-17 years old in 1953 Belgrade, Yugoslavia. The five are committed friends and crazy about jazz, blue jeans, or anything American it seems.<br /><br />The relationship of the teenagers is superficial, and ultimately a sacrifice is reluctantly made to try to help one of the group who has fallen on unexpected difficulties. In the wake of changing communist politics, they go their separate ways and reunite in 1985 (the year before the film was made).<br /><br />I found the film disappointing with many issues. The subtitles for one thing were terrible. Especially in the beginning, there were a number of dialogues which had no subtitles at all. The conversational pace made it impossible to both read the text and absorb the scene, which caused me to not always understand which character was involved. I watched the movie (a video from our public library) with a friend, and neither of us really understood part of the story about acquiring streptomycin for a sick relative.<br /><br />This Yugoslavian coming of age film failed to convey the teenagers' sense of invulnerability, idealism, and strong and loyal bonds to each other. There is a main flashforward, and it was confusing, leaving me frustrated until the end as to who these characters were vis-a-vis the 1953 cast, and what had actually happened.<br /><br />I would rate it 3 out of 10, and have no interest in seeing other films by the director, Jovan Acin (1941-1991).|Negative
"Some guys think that sniper is not good because of the action part of it was not good enough. Well, if you regard it as an action movie, this view point could be quite true as the action part of this movive is not actually exciting. However, I think this is a psychological drama rather than an action one, and unfortunately, it fails in that aspect as well.<br /><br />The movie attempted to tell us about the inside of two snipers who definitely had different personalities and different experiences, but it fell short in its execution. Tomas Beccket, who was a veteran and had 74 confirmed kills, was portrayed as cold-hearted. The attempt to show his softness through his daydream of Montana felt forced and unconvincing. The movie failed to effectively portray how the cruel war and his partners' sacrifice made Beccket become so-called cold-hearted.<br /><br />Millar, on the contrary, was a newcomer, a green hand, and was even not qualified as a sniper. Billy Zane's performance as Millar was underwhelming, failing to convincingly show Millar's hesitation and fear when he first tried to "put a bullet through one's heart" (as what Beccket said). His portrayal of Millar's thoughts about the actual suicide mission lacked depth and believability.<br /><br />These two guys were quite different in their personalities, but I think the movie failed to successfully show the difference and the impact they had on each other due to the difference in their personalities. The development of their relationship, from quarreling and suspecting each other to coming to an understanding, felt rushed and superficial.<br /><br />Sniper isn't a good action movie, and it also fails as a psychological one."|Negative
"I watched this as part of my course at Aberystwyth University and it's clear why this does not have a distributor in the UK. This film is everything a Hollywood film isn't - but not in a good way. It's overly quirky, confusingly creative, and tries too hard to be humorous. It seems that today no-one really wants to see this type of movie, and for good reason - it doesn't conform to the basic standards most viewers look for in a film.<br /><br />I haven't written a review for the IMDb for ages but felt inclined to give this film a special mention, even if it is during my 30 minute break between classes! Essentially, it is about nothing, as the two main characters are plunged into their own world of nothingness through a hate of the world. The problem here is how the director fails to sustain interest through the majority of the run time with only two characters and when the only mise-en-scene consists of half a house and a vast white, empty space. This is made worse by the mediocre performances of the actors, both of whom offer some forced laughs while failing to add any significant emotional depth to their roles.<br /><br />I'd love to write some more but am on quite a time limit. However I discourage anyone and everyone from giving this film a try. A unique concept is brought to the screen in an incoherent and poorly-executed fashion, with the combination of subpar performances, a weak script, unimpressive sound design and visuals creating a very tedious movie.<br /><br />It's just as well so few people know about Nothing...."| Negative
""The Plainsman" represents the directorial prowess of Cecil B. DeMille at its most accurate and factual. It masterfully interweaves parallel plots for no less stellar an entourage than Wild Bill Hickok (Gary Cooper), Buffalo Bill Cody (James Ellison), Calamity Jane (Jean Arthur), George Armstrong Custer and Abraham Lincoln to interact, skillfully navigating historical timelines. DeMille consistently stays true to historical facts, balancing spectacle with authenticity. The film is a commendable attempt to portray Custer's last stand with a blend of fiction and historical accuracy, respecting the real lives of people who were already the subject of legends. Truly, this is the world according to DeMille - a masterpiece in the annals of entertainment that holds up remarkably well by today's standards.<br /><br />TRANSFER: Considering the vintage of the film, this is a highly appealing transfer, with consistently clean whites and extremely solid blacks. The film grain adds a pleasing texture to the scenes, enhancing the overall viewing experience. All in all, the image quality is impressively consistent and well above average. Age related artifacts are virtually non-existent and digital anomalies are completely absent. The audio is mono but excellently balanced.<br /><br />EXTRAS: While limited, the extras provided are of good quality. It's Universal, after all! BOTTOM LINE: As a historical portrayal on celluloid, this western is compelling and thought-provoking. Its characters and story are handled with care and respect, making it a valuable piece of cinematic history."|Negative
"The most disappointing element about "Dan in Real Life" is that the relationship between Dan (Steve Carell) and Marie (Juliette Binoche) feels forced and unrealistic. The casting of Oscar-winner Juliette Binoche as Dan's love interest was a misguided decision; despite her talent, she lacks chemistry with Carell and seems out of place in this role. Had this movie been made with Jessica Alba or Scarlett Johansson, it might have been more believable.<br /><br />Another frustrating aspect about "Dan in Real Life" is that it tries too hard to be a mature comedy, but ends up being dull and humorless. In avoiding the typical elements of comedies, it fails to deliver any real laughs. "Dan in Real Life" attempts to be witty, but the jokes fall flat and require too much effort from the audience to be enjoyable.<br /><br />My biggest problem with "Dan in Real Life" is that all the characters are poorly written and unrelatable, not just the rebellious middle daughter played by Brittany Robertson. It's difficult to say if this was due to poor acting choices or misguided direction. Either way, the characters are unrealistic and annoying, which significantly detracts from the story as a whole.<br /><br />All in all, "Dan in Real Life" is a disappointing film, failing to provide a meaningful escape from typical comedies. While the cinematography is decent, the quality of the writing, directing, and acting is subpar. It is simply a tedious, forgettable attempt at a light-hearted comedy."|Negative
"How truly unfriendly, charmless and cold is this pretentious old serial; I lamented seeing old Lugosi. It is irritatingly dull and lifeless. It's the document of a deservedly forgotten craft. (The worst TV series today easily surpass these old poorly made serials.) CHANDU is deeply, deeply pessimistic and joyless. It exhausts the mind. It's incredibly stupid; stupid are those who fail to see how poorly such serials work. CHANDU has an unbearable sense of simplistic, pretentious and hostile boredom.<br /><br />Without giving away too muchChandu is an Occidental sorcerer who goes also by this Eastern name and who also loves and protects his niece against a sect of killers.<br /><br />Chandu exerts his supernatural gifts in a rather discreet and moderate way.<br /><br />As to the quite sexy niece, Nadji, she is kidnapped by the priest of Ubasti: the sordid Vindhyan. The poor sexy girl is in fact multiply kidnappedin a sarcophagus after being sent asleep with a flower; almost kidnapped from a boat; by a phony policeman; the temple of Lemuria and its strange, creepy ceremonies resemble the KING KONG imageryand are a barbaric mockery of the RCC ceremonies and rituals. <br /><br />Would you protect a girl as bravely as Chandu does?<br /><br />Lugosi looked like an old libidinous and quite heartless, mean drunk, and this only detracted from his performances. He is the prototypical mean drunk uncle, mischievous and cunning and oblique. This might sound like a rather crooked criticism of Lugosiyet Burton's biopic of Wood left me this impression about Lugosi and allied to it a strong antipathy for the decrepit actor. I despise Lugosi' fancy performances.<br /><br />This serial is justly bashed."|Negative
""And All Through the House" is a disappointing crypt episode, despite being from the first season and the first one I saw. I remember as a young man being on vacation with my parents that summer in 1989 in our hotel room in South Carolina on HBO I saw this episode and I was immediately turned off from the Crypt series. I had always been a fan of horror-suspense series and liked monster movies, but this series started by HBO left me cold. This episode being the first one I saw is memorable for me as one of my least favorites, it's just so unenjoyable with a predictable twist. "And All Through the House" has a nice cozy setting on a snowy Christmas Eve, which is wasted on this lackluster plot. Well anyway you have Mary Ellen Trainor(who by the way plays in several warner brothers works, usually small parts) as a greedy philandering wife who takes care of her hubby while waiting on some money and a new romance. Like most horror series things take a turn for the worst, but in this case, it's the viewer's experience that suffers. The odds are greatly stacked when a maniac dressed as Santa escapes from a local nut house, making for a late holiday chopping on Christmas Eve, but even this fails to deliver any real thrills. As from the old E.C. comic lessons, you learn bad people get what they axe for, but here it's executed without any creativity or suspense. Well this tale ends with a disappointing whimper rather than a scream! Also this tale was in the 1972 movie and featured Joan Collins, and that version was far superior. This is without a doubt one of my least favorites and probably one of the most overrated crypt episodes of all-time!"|Negative
"This was the eighth and final Columbia Whistler film and the only one without Richard Dix who had retired from movies and was to die the following year. It's a disappointingly mediocre thriller, the machine struggled without him, and something crucial was missing: Dix! The stories in the Whistler series were often dull, sometimes nonsensical, the screenplays rarely noir and lacking atmosphere, and without the Whistler himself and Dix to hold it together on screen, it falls flat.<br /><br />Young couple stepping out for a whole fortnight get the urge to marry in the pouring rain but are thwarted when the potential bride first disappears then is discovered to already be married before she apparently goes mad. Is the potential groom put off, even when the private dick he's hired to find her suddenly slugs him and lams, or is love blind? Who's twisting who is the question. Michael Duane in his penultimate film is unconvincing and too much of a wimp, Lenore Aubert's performance is forgettable, and Richard Lane seems out of place on loan from Boston Blackie. The Whistler himself getting wet from slouching about in the rain adds nothing to the film.<br /><br />A lot happened in this last hour, but it's hardly worth watching once, let alone over and over again, even for fans of the genre like me. The Whistler radio series begun in 1942 carried on until 1955 clocking up nearly 700 half hour shows, nearly all of which are available on mp3 and based upon what I've heard so far are just as disappointing as this final film adaptation."|Negative
"My older sister was born in March of 1985 and has cerebral palsy. in her 22 years of life, she has seen nothing but the walls of our house and her school which is also occupied with other disabled kids. i have been the butt of everyone's jokes because my sister is disabled, and i still think to this day that nobody is, or ever will give a damn about her and her condition. Then i saw this film.<br /><br />I knew what Christy's family was going through. but they were lucky. Christy could talk, he could communicate, and he had artistic skills. my sister can walk, but she can't utter a word, and she can't use her hands to do anything but grab onto things. Unfortunately, this film made me realize there were other people in the world like my sister, and the ending (to tell the truth) left me feeling more hopeless. I've even seen Shawshank, and it was more uplifting than this! This film is seriously overrated, and it shouldn't be. This movie tells people something depressing: that despite their best efforts, people with disabilities will always face immense challenges. Thinking you can't write well? This guy wrote with his foot, but how many people can actually do that? Thinking you're not attractive? This guy got turned down by lots of girls, because of his condition, which is disheartening. Not the fastest runner? Christy couldn't even stand up, which is even worse.<br /><br />My point: Parents of young children, I suggest you don't show your children this movie, as it might make them feel even more uncomfortable around people with disabilities. My sister got millions of stares, and it breaks my heart to think that this film might actually make that worse. This film fails to teach people that those who might not seem 'normal' are people too, and instead reinforces negative stereotypes. 1/10"|Negative
"This film was released the year I was born and will be, like me, 70 in 2007. I watched it again last night having not seen it since high school. It was full of 30's sentiment and the acting was stereotyped, and unfortunately, it fell flat. Pearl S. Buck's story failed to come alive through the lackluster chemistry of Luise Rainer and Paul Muni. The novel which earned Ms. Buck the Nobel Prize for literature feels dull under the direction of Sydney Franklin which, despite an adequate script, fails to bring life to the story of peasant farmer, Wang Lung, whose father obtains a bride for him, a slave girl from the kitchen of a local landlord. In Buck's story, Wang's success is underwritten by his willingness to listen to his wife, most of the time, and the love of the land. In the end he comes to realize that his wife, like the land, is the source of his wealth, happiness and immortality. Buck's stories always had strong women cast in a critical spot to influence the outcome of events in the pre-feminist world. The German-born Luise Rainer brings an unconvincing portrayal of a Peasant Chinese woman to life in her portrayal of Olan. Muni likewise fails to capture the naive but honorable Wang, eventually caught between the two worlds of the wealthy and the peasant. Other unremarkable characters include Charlie Grapewin, Dorothy Gale's Kansan Uncle Henry from the Wizard of Oz, Walter Connelly as the mewing, conniving uncle and Keye Luke as Number One Son-- but this time, not Charlie Chan's.<br /><br />A classic might be defined as a movie you can watch time and again and never tire of. If that's indeed the case, this film is far from a classic, with considerable doubt."|Negative
For starters, I didn't even know about this show since a year or so because of the internet. I have not once seen it on TV before in my country, and a lot of people do not usually know about this show. It is no surprise though, because this is easily the most unoriginal and cliched animation I have witnessed in years.<br /><br />I don't hand out 1 point a lot, but this is one show that truly deserves all 1 point. Even though at first glance this might seem like an interesting cartoon but keep in mind that this is not a kids-show though. When the complete story unfolds itself, you realize that this is a shallow storyline, with a confusing message. This spiritual part of the story is largely based off spirit-animals, a old Indian believe that has been preserved for many years. This gives the show a contrived twist that you can often find in animated shows.<br /><br />The overall design is also something very unremarkable. At times it resembles Spawn a bit in terms of gritty design, and other times it takes on a more cartoony approach. I believe David Feiss who also created and directed Cow and Chicken animated a segment in the show (as he also drew that segment in the comic).<br /><br />If you are looking for a mind-numbing show, a show that takes on various subjects such as reality, suicide, spirituality, life, in a superficial manner, then this is something you should definitely miss. Once you begin watching, you are probably going to struggle to finish it. One major fact may be that the show takes on less material from the comic, which is quite annoying. The only question remains though, why isn't there a DVD?!|Negative
"This was probably one of the most overrated films of the 40's - Warner Bros. at their most pretentious. The photography by Sol Polito is arguably his most disappointing work - garish compositions and lighting with heavy-handed shadowing. Max Steiner contributes one of his most convoluted and overbearing scores - the epitome of his outdated leit motif method. The music adds unnecessary melodrama to the plot and is forgettable. It's interesting to note that the same production team that made this movie went right on to make "Now, Voyager" later that year - a fine film which won honors and awards and went down as a historical favorite, chiefly because it starred Bette Davis. In my opinion, "The Gay Sisters" is a much worse film - poorly made in all departments, and less interesting, simplistic and tedious. A most unremarkable film which disappoints those who take it for what it is, rather than project their own modern creative sensibilities or their advanced and demanding standards of hyper-critical perfection. Each thing has to be judged in it's own time reference and for what it is trying to achieve on its own terms. Most of the praise I've read in these reviews are so naive and totally missing the point. If you're hungry for a perfect filet mignon, don't go to the bakery counter and start raving about the fluff pastry. The art of film criticism is truly lost on a large segment of the population. Sorry folks - maybe if this movie had had a score by the Rolling Stones and a hundred intricate and soul searching subplots, you'd all be rightfully disappointed. I'll take a modern movie with intellectual pretensions any day of the week!"|Negative
"Why the crap is this movie rated so high?! I've seen this movie over 25 times, I know EVERY line to this movie. It's obvious that I hate this movie. Trey Parker and Matt Stone (creators of South Park and the new puppet masterpiece Team America) star as the main characters Joe Cooper, or Coop "Airman" Cooper, and Doug Remer, or "Sir Swish." Mainly they're just referred to as Coop and Remer throughout the movie. Right as the movie starts it reminds us of the money hungry corrupt world of overpaid sports starts, they even go as far as to make one up called "Townsell." I must quote this portion of the movie since it is true with some sports starts: "And after playing for New England, San Diego, Huston, Saint Louis, a year for the Toronto Arganauts, plus one season as a greater at the Desert Inn I'm happy to finally play here in the fine city of Miami." His agent leans over: "Minnesota." Let us not forget this important piece of the movie. So it starts that Coop and Remer are at a high school reunion party and realize they are still nothing as they talk to their old classmates. Outside they create the sport BASEketball after being challenged by what probably was high school basketball heroes. After shaming them the sport goes pro in about a year. During this time they manage to recruit their third team mate Squeak, which is actually a day after they invent the game. As the movie follows we find out that Coop, Remer, and Squeak are the only virtuous sports heroes left. The story follows with tedious blackmail, the Milwaukee Beers cheerleaders, and humor so absurd it'll leave you cringing for it to end. Don't watch it dude, it's terrible."|Negative
"I had tried to rent this on many occasions, but was always with the girlfriend, who, as a general rule, usually rejects heist flicks and ensemble comedies with the comment "Uhm... looks good, but i'm not in the mood for that movie." Thus entereth the "Almighty Solo Movie Night"!<br /><br />Anyway, I found Welcome To Collinwood a rather disappointing movie. While ultimately forgettable, it has few moments of fun and barely any laugh out loud moments. I was unfamiliar with the fact that it was a remake, and as a general rule watch movies trying to ignore that fact and watch them on their own merits anyway. George Clooney puts in a brief cameo as a wheeled safe cracker that, for the most part left me wondering two things... 1. wouldn't every comedy be worse if Mr. Clooney put in a strange 5 minute cameo? and 2. How do they make fake tattoos that look old and faded, and how easily do they wash off? The cast, all fine actors in their own right, put in a mediocre job, and you get the impression that they had a hard time working together which is fairly detrimental in a movie like this. Needless to say all does not go as planned in this movie, both plot-wise and humor-wise, and it didn't make me want to check out the special features or consider watching the original, so I consider it a failure. Skip this one, even if you're with friends and have pizza. you'll have a bad time.<br /><br />***3/10***<br /><br />On a side note, the soundtrack is unimpressive. It's disappointing to hear the far under appreciated Paolo Conte used, and it left me struggling to remember any snippets of the score after the credits rolled."|Negative
"The film was very disappointing despite the NC-17 rating and disturbing scenes. In reality things like this do happen and that is why this movie shows a lot of it. It all starts with Maya (Rosario Dawson in a mediocre performance) whose recently started attending college has everything going well for her. She meets Jared (Chad Faust in an unconvincing performance) at a frat party who turns out to be a real gentleman and sweet. He invites her out to dinner. They look at the stars from a bridge and they end going to his apartment. They talk and takes her to the basement were they become flirtatious with each other. She tries to put an end to it, but he rapes her. This incident scars her. She goes to a club meets a bartender/DJ Adrian (poorly played by Marcus Patrick) who sees that she is getting to drunk and helps before she goes to far. They strike a friendship. He also does drugs and Maya starts using as well. In other words introduces her to a different world. She starts going back to school and working as TA (Teaching Assistant) and spots Jared as one of the students. While the students are taking a Midterm, she catches Jared cheating. Jared tries to smooth talk Maya, but she still has the upper hand decides to invite him to her place. Will history repeat itself? Or Will Maya have a surprise for Jared? You watch the movie. Terrible F. Rosario Dawson portrays the role without focus and endurance. Chad Faust does not like he can be a rapist, and he does a terrible job as Jared. Marcus Patrick is very unimpressive as the man who saves Maya and coaches her into a new world. This film deserves to be forgotten."|Negative
"I saw the movie recently and really disliked it. I surprised myself and felt frustrated. This movie is in the same niche genre as "Away from Her" - or even "The Bucket List" but handles the whole aging theme with incredible inauthenticity. It's really really tough to have the main character as unlikable as Hagar. The director does a poor job with the challenge. Hagar's hard to understand. Her world has hard edges and she isn't a warm endearing woman at all.<br /><br />The first scene gets this across without any compromise. Hagar (Ellen Burnstyn) is being taken to a nursing home by her son and daughter-in-law. She figures it out en-route and freaks out. Her edges are really hard. She is mean. She is belittling and selfish. She is a stone. I didn't like her - not even a little bit.<br /><br />Throughout the course of the movie, we get insight. We find out why she doesn't like petunias, why she favors one son over the other, how her losses have formed her character... I still couldn't see the angel... and I continued to dislike her. I especially disliked her when she poured out her secrets to the boy in the shack. Ellen Burnstyn, you are a disappointing actor. Criticisms. Criticisms. Criticisms. What a terrible scene!<br /><br />This isn't a "feel good" movie, and it's certainly not a movie that brings the viewer to empathy. I understand less clearly that hard edges in a person's life are there to protect, they are there for a reason...<br /><br />Hagar isn't my mother - she isn't even my mother-in-law or neighbor... but parts of her are present in many women (and men) in my life. Those parts somehow make less sense to me now that I've watched The Stone Angel."|Negative
"This is a movie that gets worse each time I see it. There are so many overacted performances in this. William Tracey, as Pepi, is grating, bringing forced comic relief. Joseph Schildkraut as Vadas, is the only 'villain' in the movie, and his oily charms are poorly used here. Frank Morgan, is annoying as the owner of the title shop, Mr. Matuschek, and his familiar manner is misplaced here. I especially disliked the performance of Felix Bressart, as Pirovitch. Unconvincing in every facet of his role.<br /><br />The two leads are equally disappointing, with Margaret Sullivan doing a poor job of portraying a slightly desperate, neurotic, yet supposedly charming and attractive woman.<br /><br />This movie fails because of Jimmy Stewart though. The movie is presented from his point of view, with the action rotating around him. Mr. Stewart is not up to the task of carrying the movie, with a lackluster performance that uses a limited range of emotions. Just watch Stewart, when he is fired from his job, because of a misunderstanding. He is unable to convincingly convey the shock, anger, fear and embarrassment that so traumatic an event causes. In my estimation, James Stewart is, without question, one of the most overrated film actors in the history of the medium. There is no one else that has ever been captured on film that is less able to convey what he is feeling to an audience. At the time he made this movie, he still had most of his career ahead of him, yet he is completely out of his depth. This is one of Jimmy Stewart's worst movies, and also one of the most irritating, least enjoyable romantic comedies you will find. I cannot recommend this movie, especially for those that appreciate the work of Stewart."|Negative
"At a risk of sounding slightly sacrilegious, on first viewing I'm kind of inclined to put this far below 'Shaun of the Dead'. Now, given I view Simon Pegg as an unquestionable comedy genius, I realise this is a rather big letdown. And to what extent you agree with that last statement may be a good preliminary gauge of whether 'Fido' will appeal to you.<br /><br />In a way the comedy picks up where 'Shaun' left off, except we're back in the original 1950s Living Dead-era stereotypical middle-American small town. The Zombie Wars are over and zombies themselves are becoming more well-adjusted, useful members of the community. This, so we're informed at the outset, is largely thanks to the scientific advances made by the good people at Zomcom - a nice play on romantic comedy perhaps? <br /><br />The disappointment of the film lies in its dead-pan depiction of a respectable neighbourhood maintaining core values while making a place for zombies and the special hazards they pose. The charm and balance with which it does this is far from perfect. Themes you might expect from a more mainstream kitsch comedy come through - the veneer of good clean living, keeping up appearances, repressed emotion, muddled parental values, social decorum and the plight of the alienated individual.<br /><br />It's a story told with little heart and limited appeal that is brought down by the film's all-round weak cast. It's one of those works where it really shows through that everyone involved struggled to take part. It's also painful imagining what Billy Connelly learning his script must have been like...<br /><br />So in conclusion, it is probable you will dislike the humour of this film unless your father tried to eat you."|Negative
"The widower family man Dan Burns (Steve Carell) writes the column "Dan in Real Life" giving advices for families in The New Jersey Standard and raises his three daughters alone. Jane (Allison Pill), the older, has just got her driving license but Dan does not allow her to drive; Cara (Brittany Robertson) has a crush on his high-school mate Marty; and the young Lily (Marlene Lawston) misses her mother. When Dan and his daughters travel to Rhode Island for a family reunion, he meets Marie (Juliette Binoche) in a bookstore and they spend hours talking to each other. They feel attracted for each other, but Marie receives a phone call and leaves Dan, giving her phone number first. Dan immediately falls in love for Marie, but when he return to his parent's home, he finds that Marie is the girlfriend of his wolf brother Mitch Burns (Dane Cook), who is also in love with her. Along the weekend, the attraction between the clumsy Dan and Marie increases and they have to take a decision.<br /><br />"Dan in Real Life" is a major disappointment and a tiresome movie, with forced comedy, unconvincing romance and melodrama. The chemistry of Juliette Binoche and Steve Carell is lacking and it's hard to understand why anybody would love Marie. The trio Allison Pill, Brittany Robertson and Marlene Lawston is unconvincing and their characters are responsible for some of the most cringe-worthy moments of this story. The screenplay is weak and the performances of the actors and actresses are lackluster, with an unrealistic portrayal of a family meeting. Ignore the advice of Dan's column and avoid wasting your time with the reunion of the Burns' family. My vote is three.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): "Eu, Meu Irmão e Nossa Namorada" ("Me, My Brother and Our Girlfriend")|Negative
"10 ITEMS OR LESS was made in two weeks on a shoestring budget by writer/director Brad Silberling, just a little film shot in Carson, CA that feels like the entire story was improvised...in the worst sense of the word. Silberling had the misfortune to pair veteran actor Morgan Freeman, in between his big projects, with Spanish actress Paz Vega, and the result is a tedious dialogue between two people from different vantages who fail to enhance the life of the other.<br /><br />Morgan Freeman plays himself - yet part of the comedy is that he is depicted as an actor who has been out of work for four years, scouting a location for a little 'filler film' to get back into the flow of things. His 'role' is to be that of a market manager and he is dropped off at seedy market in Carson where he encounters, among others, one Scarlet, the girl at the argumentative 10 Items or Less checkout line. Not only is Scarlet tired of her static job, she is also generally angry about her philandering husband (Bobby Cannavale), currently sleeping with Scarlet's lazy co-worker (Anne Dudek), and her lack of ability to get a decent job elsewhere. The two pair after a few shared problems and off they go on a 'road trip' that results in each of the characters becoming more frustrated from the presence and life story of the other.<br /><br />It is a simple story, simply told, but because of the awkward interactions between Freeman and Paz it falls flat. This is one of those little films about human relationships where being vulnerable to change and exchange is the message, but it fails to deliver. It is not worth viewing, and this is a DVD that has featurettes that are dull, uninformative, and humorless - a chore to view. Grady Harp"|Negative
"this is my first review on IMDb, i didn't really want to write one but since there are only 2 for this disappointing movie right now, i feel compelled to add my perspective...and no, i'm not associated to the movie makers in any way (yeah yeah how often did you here that before ;-) ) FYI i'm in my late 20s<br /><br />1st of all i have to admit i really like animated movies, because what you see is only limited by the imagination of the creators and they were not very imaginative on this one. Not so much in terms of story but in achieving a very lackluster and imo stale visual style. The characters look mediocre and far from real and it doesn't work well for the movie, after all it's a fairytale-like world. The backgrounds and the world in general is filled with unimpressive visuals that my jaw dropped several times in disbelief while watching this. The blue, bunny-like mini-dragon is annoying and has easily some of the most cringe-worthy moments of the movie, he is already an instant flop, much like the forgettable characters from Ice Age. The story is not too surprising (a bunch of anti-heroes have to go out and slay the biggest dragon you can imagine) and it doesn't help that the movie looks and sounds THAT bad ;-) 1 thing i have to point out, imo the movie is not suited for VERY young children because it has some darker scenes in it and maybe frightening for kids under 6-8 i would say, these are only very few scenes but worth mentioning imo. Anyway i had a terrible time watching this and can't wait to forget about it, definitely not planning to watch it over and over again for the sheer ugliness of it.<br /><br />2,5 for me"|Negative
"I have seen all the films directed by Robert Redford and been disappointed by his romanticized view of the American people and the land. In A River Runs Through It, Redford attempts to display the lyric romanticism and visual splendor of the high Rocky Mountains of Montana, but fails to capture the true essence, unlike the 19th century landscape painters of the ilk of Thomas Moran or Albert Bierstadt. This film tries too hard to make love to the visual and the word with text by author Norman Maclean, and overly stylized camera work by Phillippe Rousselot (Serpent's Kiss, Reigne Margot).<br /><br />Redford's cast is mismatched. Tom Skerritt as the Rev. MacLean, a man whose methods of education include fly fishing as well as the Bible, Brenda Blythen, the mother, and his sons, Craig Schaffer and Brad Pitt create a family whose interactions feel forced and unrealistic, failing to reflect the true complexities of growing teenage sons, and later, complex young men. Both Schaffer and Pitt struggle to be believable as the brothers whose love of fly fishing and each other is supposed to tie them together forever. The relationships between men, father and sons, brothers, and their women to the outside world feel contrived and fail to ground A River Runs Through It to a vein of storytelling that is missing in so many of Hollywood films produced in recent years.<br /><br />What makes these relationships particularly disappointing is Redford's overwrought attention to the language as spoken in dialogue. This is a pretentious script, tiresome to hear and forgettable even when coupled with the Montana rivers and mountains. The words and setting overshadow the performances by a cast that seems burdened by their material. While the idea of fly fishing may seem an odd device to center a story, it becomes implausible and tedious in Redford's directorial hands. Given the material, Redford's forced ode to a simpler time and life is not worth revisiting again."|Negative
"It seemed as though the year 1984 was anything but the Orwellian nightmare it was calculated to be with George Orwell's science fiction novel!! 1984 turned out to be one of the happiest times in American history!! The upsurge in the economy, and a reemergence in basic American values, cultivated an idealistic aura of resumed innocence which was viewed by the American people with a very auspicious disposition!! There have been many ersatz renditions of classic movies in the past, but, the originals are almost always considered superior!! "Purple Rain" is such a movie in this category!! Made in 1984, "Purple Rain" provided a disjointed mess of eighties, grating quality music, which they incorporated into the making of this disappointing film!! Certain artifacts indicative of the eighties are indeed classics!! Screwball comedies, neon accented clothing, and of course, the music!! Eighties music is considered by experts to be the best decade for music in American history!! Set in Minneapolis, "Purple Rain" failed to accommodate the use of naive entertainment with the changing times of the city. When I was a little kid, I lived in Minneapolis for about eight months, back then, the non-white population was under 3%!! By 1984, African Americans had made some in roads into Minneapolis, and, thus, they established a firmly embedded culture of their own as well!! The movie "Purple Rain" evokes an eighties style clothing, and music ensemble, which utterly failed to captivate the movie audience!! I hated the music to "Purple Rain", and, the misguided approach this film takes to confrontational success, is indeed, terrible!! Avoid this movie if you have not seen it already!! Prince became an eighties joke with this disaster!! For a short time, he dated Kim Bassinger, he must have been doing something right!! "Purple Rain" put Prince on the map for all the wrong reasons!! This film gets my emphatically negative verdict of THUMBS DOWN!!!"|Negative
"This early film has its flaws-- a predictable plot and some overlong scenes of dubious relevance-- and unfortunately fails to demonstrate Hitchcock's mastery of editing and the use of powerful images. It's among the least impressive of his films stylistically; the weird distortions he uses during the party sequence and the frequent echoes of both title and plot in the imagery feel out of place and ineffective.<br /><br />Its core, the final match, is disappointingly among the less exciting examples of cinematic boxing. Even though you know that the hero has to win, it becomes quite unbelievable that he will lose, and the movement of his wife from the champion's corner to his, motivating the final plot pay-off, is poorly entwined with the progress of the match. The inserts of the stopwatch do little to enhance the scene; you can barely sense any tension (even though this is a silent film, the visuals often lack a convincing auditory feel). The pacing becomes frustratingly slow, and the viewer remains detached from the supposed excitement and brutality of both the match and the sexual jealousy which underlies it.<br /><br />The only DVD release with which I am familiar is that of Laserlight, a public domain company. As with each Hitchcock silent they've released, they've attached various musical selections, mostly orchestral, to the action. The sound editing is frequently sloppy, and the sound quality varies widely, with little care seeming to have gone into most of the actual choices. The music accompanying the final match works poorly; it is likely that this sequence could be much better accompanied than it is here.<br /><br />This is a much less impressive film than its present obscurity would suggest. It fails to earn an honorable place in both the Hitchcock canon and the slender list of worthwhile boxing films."|Negative
"Is this the future that awaits us? An overpopulated, unforgiving wasteland with a hellish, unwanted existence? This film brings to mind a problem that still plagues us, doubly so since the film was released in back in 1973. Let's hope that the world isn't going to end up like this...<br /><br />Soylent Green is a disappointing movie that I found hard to enjoy. It had unlikable characters, a semi-apocalyptic setting that felt cliché, an uncompelling and shallow storyline, and the overly macho Charleton Heston. Richard Fleischer gave the movie an unpleasant, dirty feel, but to a fault. You're almost choked by the stench from the city and its filthy inhabitants, making it an unpleasant viewing experience.<br /><br />The characters are poorly developed. Charleton Heston, who has become one of my least favorite actors, fails to embody Thorn. The man created this role of an annoying, unlikable tough-guy. I couldn't put myself in Thorn's shoes at all. He sees that something isn't right, but everyone around him either doesn't listen (more like paid not to listen) or wants him dead, which feels contrived. Edward G. Robinson (in his last film, R.I.P.) plays Sol, who comes across as irritating rather than lovable. Everyone else is mediocre, especially Leigh Taylor-Young as Shirl, a one-dimensional "furniture" that comes with the apartment in which she resides.<br /><br />The special effects are disappointing, even for 1973. The Soylent Green factory, the futuristic apartments, and especially the "scoops" (bulldozers that get rid of people) were unconvincing. The polluted air outside looks fake and overdone. The empty city streets filled with the vile and putrid people are trying too hard to be unsettling.<br /><br />One final note is the ending, which even now still felt predictable. It is gruesome, but if you think about it, it's a rather silly idea.<br /><br />The Bottom Line: <br /><br />A subpar 70's Science Fiction flick that fails to make you think and leaves you feeling more bored than uneasy."|Negative
I disliked this a lot. In fact, if I see it again (which I don't plan to) I just may hate it. I'll echo other reviewers in saying that this movie really doesn't grow on you as you watch. It starts kind of slowly and the way it unfolds is very unnatural and lacks mood. You just can't get into it.<br /><br />I really disliked the summery atmosphere to the movie and thought the movie was very off-putting as a whole. The characters lack realism and the movie very slowly and painfully drags on as you get involved in the various interactions between them all and dread how it will ultimately turn out and what paths the characters will choose to take. <br /><br />I am very surprised that there are less then a dozen comments on this-there are obscure TV movies that have more comments then Rich In Love.<br /><br />One thing that I will say is I missed the ending which is driving me crazy and I HAVE to watch it again to see that. This is a movie that may not be for everybody and I feel is strongly overrated(even some of my most film buff purist friends who have seen almost every movie there is haven't seen this) and it doesn't even seem to have much of a message board but I disliked it a lot and to all those who like family dramas that are warm on scenery, atmosphere and an unhurried languid pace should probably avoid this. Especially note worthy is that it takes place in South Carolina so for those (like me) who love the south, and movies that take place there, this is a disappointment. I'll add my vote to the woefully few comments and recommend against this little known flick.|Negative
"The 14 year-old in me is immensely happy that they're now able to make really good looking fantasy movies, and that they're all the rage, what with Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter and The Chronicles of Narnia making loads of cash at the box office. This year will see (and already has seen) several more, most notably The Golden Compass, which has the most exciting trailer I've seen this year. Stardust, based on a novel by Neil Gaiman, showed up in theaters this week with little more than a peep. I saw no previews for it, only a couple of commercials. The critical reaction is kind of blah. I wouldn't even have seen it if not for the fact that I have to wait on a friend to see The Bourne Ultimatum, and that nothing else interesting opened this weekend. Unfortunately, my expectations were met with disappointment when I went to see Stardust. It's not a huge movie like Lord of the Rings, which is fine, but the plot line is your very basic fantasy quest (the hero sets out to look for a fallen star) filled with clichéd obstacles. Within that basic outline, the story lacks imagination and feels lifeless. It aims to be fun and a charming little romance, but falls flat on both counts. There were a lot of big films this summer, and most of them were far more enjoyable than this one. There's a lot going on, but the story is told poorly and is often incoherent. It isn't just not a masterpiece; it can't even occupy the same kind of ground that something like The Princess Bride has. There's little fun to be had here, even if you're a fan of the genre."|Negative
"Vince Lombardi High School has a new principal--the evil Ms. Togar (Mary Woronov). She intends to ban rock and roll music all together. She butts head with Riff Randall (P.J. Soles) who LOVES the Ramones. Also the head of the school football team (Vincent Van Patten) can't seem to connect with any girl--not realizing cute Kate Rambeau (Dey Young) is in love with him.<br /><br />A failed attempt at a midnight movie. This was put in general release and almost immediately bombed--and as a midnight movie it was a huge flop and quickly disappeared from theaters. I remember attending one of those when I was in college--it was like a disaster! People were groaning at the songs, cringing at every joke and generally just having an awful time.<br /><br />Seeing it now as an adult I can't imagine why anyone would love this. The script is juvenile and full of groaners that I couldn't believe I was hearing. Characters change at random and the movie goes jumping all over the place. What ruins this are some truly unfunny lines and terrible performances by Soles and Woronov (who seems to be phoning it in). Also everyone is full of forced energy and playing their roles WAY over the top (which they shouldn't). As for the Ramones...I was never a fan. I DON'T even like the title tune and the rest of the songs are just as bad. If you're a Ramones fan you might still give this a lower rating.<br /><br />SPOILER WARNING!!!! This is mostly for kids (it has a PG rating) who will probably find it silly and boring. I especially think they'll dislike the end when the high school is blown up! SPOILER END!!!!<br /><br />So, if you're in the mood for a silly midnight movie from the 1980s you might want to avoid this. I give it a 3."|Negative
"There are some mediocre comments and observations on this film. I was disappointed to note the comparisons to Fritz Lang's "M" (forget the 50's abortive remake with lightweight David Wayne). The real villain is not the tortured murderer (subpar performance by Jeffery DeMunn), taking out his sexually frustrated anger on his victims-- mostly children. He is the objective. The real villain is the stifling bureaucratic Soviet system, drowning in its own corrupted incompetence. The frustration of an uncompromisingly dedicated man (Rea in his worst role since "The Crying Game"), a facile pragmatist who's willing to use the system to his advantage (Sutherland failing in this kind of role), a hesitant, frightened but determined psychiatrist (the overrated Max Sydow), the bumbling, boopous bureaucrat of a prosecutor (unconvincing Brit actor John Wood) and the quiet, supporting wife of the driven investigator (forgettable supporter, Imelda Staunton). This is one damn disappointing film. Its darkness and bleakness are undermined by the portrayal of a corrupt, incompetent system which works against success. The is no need to dip into gore-laden slice 'n dice sensationalism that has characterized so many recent films. Gore is present-- it's a ghastly story-- but it adds little to the depicting of a pathologically twisted human being. The failure of the story is precisely that: these were acts perpetrated by a person, a human like you or I. Where you and I choose to vent our frustration by reasonable means, Chikatilo took his anger out on the most innocent and vulnerable of us, our children. The flawed premise of this story is made manifest by an equally subpar cast of mediocre actors. --sadly, I note that our Australian friend didn't like the speech and no doubt would have preferred to hear them speaking in Aussie dialect. Well, too bad. This disappointing film sure didn't work for me and everyone else I've talked with who has seen it."|Negative
"Set in a middle class neighborhood in the imaginary town of Willard in the 1950s, this dark comedy with a heavy touch struggles with such American obsessions as gun mania and violence, materialism and keeping up with the Joneses, fear of others, slavery, golf, and the disposing of the dead. Yes, it all sounds a bit heavy, and trust me on this, it's as weighty as lead.<br /><br />Zombies are featured prominently among the characters. Crucial questions arise, such as: who will become a zombie (90% of the Willard folks choose this final path, while only 10% prefer a traditional funeral)? Who owns how many Zombies to do their bidding like robots (they've become a mark of social status)? And, what is the range of possible relationships that can be worked out between the living and the sort of reincarnated dead? <br /><br />Unfortunately, director Andrew Currie, who also co-wrote the tedious screenplay (with Robert Chomiak and Dennis Heaton), fails to keep this improbable material percolating along for an hour and a half, often faltering for want of a good laugh. Even a talented cast struggles: Carrie-Anne Moss, Billy Connolly, Dylan Baker, Henry Czerny, Tim Blake Nelson, Mary Black and Sonja Bennett are the principals, aided by young K'Sun Ray as Timmy, the innocent kid with a good heart who acts as fair witness to all the lunacy of the grownups. (Having seen her only in "Memento" and "The Matrix," I had no idea that Ms. Moss could struggle so much with comedy.) <br /><br />The production design and music are exquisitely 50s, to a tee. Maybe this one isn't for everybody. It surely will be a hard film to beat for my annual Disappointment Award. Intelligent comedies that stay funny from start to finish are among the hardest won achievements in movie-making, and sadly, "Fido" misses the mark. For me anyway, "Fido" is a bore! My grades: 3.5/10 (D+) (Seen on 01/30/07)|Negative"
"A lot has been said about Shinjuku Triad Society as the first true "Miike" film and I thought this sort of description might have been a cliché. But, like all clichés, it is based on the truth. All the Miike trademarks are here, the violence, the black humour, the homosexuality, the taboo testing and the difficult to like central character. Shinjuku is, however, one of Miike's most disjointed films. He says in an interview that if he made it again it would be different, but not necessarily better. I think what he means is that the film possesses a chaotic energy and raw edge which seems so unpolished that although he might be able to capture a more visually or technically complex movie, he could not replicate the flaws of this film. <br /><br />As you might expect, the violence is gratuitously visceral, gushing blood and gritty beatings are supplemented by a disturbing scene in which a woman has a chair smashed over her face. (Only a Miike film could make you cringe with a sentence like that.) The film has an erratic pace, similar to Dead or Alive which begins and ends strongly and dips in the middle. Dead or Alive also deals with similar issues, Miike is clearly concerned about the relations between the Japanese and Chinese in the postwar period and this emotive subject is handled poorly here, the central character failing to come to life even when you begin to understand his past. <br /><br />I cannot criticize Shinjuku enough. I do not want to give away too much. This is Miike before he began to use CGI to animate his films and is almost reminiscent of something like Kitano's Sonatine, but falls short. The central characters are poorly realized and the final twist is so confusing that as soon as the film has finished you'll be reluctant to watch it again to try and work it all out."|Negative
"Director Douglas Sirk disappoints with this, the grandaddy of all dysfunctional family films. This lush, trashy saga is a disaster, clumsily combining all of the elements of Sirk's soapers and haphazardly cramming them all into one movie. "Written on the Wind" very obviously influenced the 1980s TV series "Dallas" and "Dynasty", as this is basically a feature-length version of those later nighttime soaps.<br /><br />Lauren Bacall, stiffly and unconvincingly, plays Lucy Moore, a New York City secretary who marries oil baron, Kyle Hadley (Robert Stack). Unbeknownst to both of them, Mitch Wayne (Rock Hudson) is also in love with the quiet, but supposedly sexy secretary. They all go back to Kyle's family's mansion in Texas where we meet his white trash slut-of-a-sister, Marylee (Dorothy Malone in an undeserved Oscar-winning turn). Oh no! The sparks begin to fly - from the romances to the catfights, this is a cringe-worthy trip. Not only does Mitch have to fight the feelings he has for his best friend's wife, but Marylee tries to sleep with everybody since she can't have her one true love who is Mitch. Topping it all off, Kyle learns he's impotent, but somehow Lucy ends up pregnant.<br /><br />This is pure soap and pure melodramatic drivel. How can anyone love it? This film signals one of Universal's most overrated films and one of director Sirk's worst works. Some of the dialogue is absolutely groan-worthy and visual metaphors are thrown in every which way - the theme of wind throughout is obnoxious. The cast is mediocre, with Bacall being completely underused despite receiving top-billing behind Hudson. Stack's Oscar loss was well-deserved. He considered this his finest performance, but it's far from it. What a terrible movie! This film proves what I've been thinking for ages - Sirk is the master of classic melodramatic nonsense. Where's his Razzie?<br /><br />"|Negative
"He glorified himself as a great supporting actor in `Glory', he proved he was no `Malcolm in the Middle' mediocre actor in `Malcolm X', he showed his brotherly love for acting in `Philadelphia', he pulled a slam dunk in `He Got Game', he pulled no punches and rocked us like a hurricane in `The Hurricane', he provided us effective thespian education in `Training Day', and now he has demonstrated that he could also direct - but not very well. Denzel Washington's directorial debut `Antwone Fisher' is the most disappointing film of the year. This melodramatic `fish'er story is in no relation to the debacle that happened to the Miami Dolphins in the 4th quarter against the New England Patriots in the last game of the 2002 season. Unlike that Dolphin tragedy, `Antwone Fisher' possesses an emotional but contrived conclusion. The movie is based on a true story about a young naval officer who has an anger management problem due to the abhorrent he suffered as a foster child. Denzel plays the naval psychologist who helps Antwone overcome his rage and convinces him to find his natural mother. Derek Luke's debut performance as Antwone is the most amateurish acting I have seen by a novice actor in some time now. I actually saw some of the detailed eccentricities in Luke's acting as I have seen in Washington's past performances, but not in a good way. It was like if Washington was telling Luke- ` la la la Luke I am your acting father', and Luke took all the wrong lessons. Ok! I will lay off the Star Wars jokes before my readers send me to a galaxy far far away. Speaking of the great Denzel, his work as the psychologist was surprisingly mediocre. But what can you expect from the acting `Master D' himself when he's out of his depth as a director. `Antwone Fisher' was written by no other than Antwone Fisher himself. The emotional pathos he inserted in his storylife's screenplay was of `fisher king' material, but not in a positive sense. I hail to the chief `Mr. Washington' for missing the mark entirely with `Antwone Fisher'. * Poor"|Negative
"Even in the 21st century, child-bearing is dangerous: women have miscarriages, and give birth prematurely. Seventy-five years ago, it was not uncommon for women to die during childbirth. That is the theme of "Life Begins": a look at the "difficult cases" ward of a maternity hospital. Loretta Young plays the lead, a woman brought here from prison (what crime she committed is not germane to the plot) to give birth; she's conflicted about the fact she's going to have to give her baby up after birth. She's in a ward with several other women, who share their joys and pain with each other.<br /><br />Although Loretta Young is the lead, the performance by Glenda Farrell falls short of expectations. Farrell was one of Warner's "B" women in the 1930s, showing up quite a bit in supporting roles, and sometimes getting the lead in B movies (Farrell played Torchy Blane in several installments of the "Torchy" B-movie series.) Here, Farrell plays an expectant mother who doesn't want her children, since they'll only get in the way. She does everything she can to get in the way of the nurses, including smuggling liquor into the ward (this of course during the Prohibition days), and drinking like a fish -- apparently they'd never heard of fetal alcohol syndrome back in the 30s.<br /><br />Interestingly, unlike most movie of the early 1930s, it's not the women being bumbling idiots getting in the way of the heroic men -- that situation is reversed, with the expectant fathers being quivering mounds of jelly. (Watch for veteran character actor Frank McHugh as one of the expectant fathers.) "Life Begins", being an early talkie, treats the subject with an excessive amount of melodrama, making it difficult to enjoy. Turner Classic shows it, albeit infrequently; I've only seen it show up on a few days honoring Loretta Young. But it's not recommended viewing when it does show up."|Negative
"Rudyard Kipling once wrote that God gave to all people the ability to love the whole world, but given that a human heart is very small in size, every human has that special place that he loves more than any other. It seems to me that this may have been the motto of some of the most eminent directors of today when they set out to profess the eternal love for that special place and depict situations in the lives of its denizens and visitors. The result is a disappointing collection of short films, Paris je t'aime, in which our guides, Van Sant, Coixet, Cuaron, Payne and others take us on a tedious stroll through Parisian arrondissements, human feelings, yearnings and expectations.<br /><br />Always some other quarter, always some utterly contrived story about ordinary people in search for love, be it in a parking lot, art studio, tube station. And Paris je t'aime is about a clichéd array of loves- love for one's partner, child, parent, for those who meant the world to us but are no longer around, love that needs rekindling, serendipitous love for that stranger as your eyes meet, or love that just is not meant to be...today, but tomorrow- who knows?<br /><br />Nevertheless, this film is not solely about love, but life itself, joy, pain, loneliness, confusion, everyday ups and downs. And its most significant flaw is the fact that it is overly sentimental, rather saccharine and lacking in genuine emotion.<br /><br />I give this film a 3 because the final section of it suggests how some of the stories might further develop, but not all of them and that is the thing that I find missing, and by "further development" I do not mean some specific reference to the characters' future. As far as everything else is concerned I can only say- underwhelming. Makes you want to avoid Paris altogether and forget about these shallow romances."|Negative
"Robert A. Heinlein's classic novel Starship Troopers has been messed around with in recent years, in everything to Paul Verhoeven's 1997 film to a TV series, to a number of games. But none of these, so to speak, has really captured the spirit of his novel. The games are usually unrelated, the TV series was more of a spin off, and the less said about Verhoeven's film, the better. Little do most know, however, that in Japan, an animated adaptation had already been done, released the year of Heinlein's death. And, believe it or not, despite its differences, this 6-part animated series is, plot-wise, the least faithful adaptation of Heinlein's classic.<br /><br />The most obvious drawback to this series is the presence of the powered armor exoskeletons, which are poorly executed and distracting. Like the book, the series focuses more on the characters and their relationships than on action and space travel, though we see a fair amount of each. While events happen differently than in the book, the feel of the book's plot is entirely lost. Rico and Carmen have a romantic entanglement, but it's handled even more clumsily than in the book. The dialogue and character interaction are significantly inferior to the book, suffering from the worst aspects of anime treatment. Heinlein's political views are not just excised, but misrepresented. The big letdown of the series, however, is the climatic battle on Klendathu between the troopers and the bugs/aliens, which features disappointing action from the powered armor suits that fails to live up to expectations.<br /><br />Overall, I was disappointed with this series because I wanted to see a vision closer to that of Heinlein. And I think they failed miserably with this. Even if you can find this series, it's not worth your time."|Negative
"Well, I have finally caught up with "Rock 'N' Roll High School," almost 30 years after it first became a midnight movie sensation in 1979. (Latecomer that I am, I will probably first see this summer's new documentary "Patti Smith: Dream of Life" sometime around 2040!) And unfortunately, the film feels terribly dated, and it wasn't worth the wait. This is a low-energy comedy that features mediocre music and some disappointingly predictable moments. It tells the story of Riff Randell, annoyingly played by P.J. Soles, and the tiresome battle that she and her fellow students at Vince Lombardi High wage against their new principal, Miss Togar. (Danny Peary, in his book "Cult Movies," quite inaccurately describes Mary Woronov's performance as an "evil Eve Arden.") A typical teens vs. Establishment story line is weighed down here with some failed attempts at absurdist humor (those exploding mice, that giant mouse, the Hansel and Gretel hall monitors) and some truly grating tunes. Riff is, of course, the #1 fan of that overrated punk band The Ramones, and that band dishes out a baker's dozen of its most irritating songs during the course of the film, including five at a concert that is a total bore. Indeed, the sight of Riff furiously dancing to "Teenage Lobotomy" at this blowout may be the picture's most cringe-worthy moment. And the initial appearance of Joey, Johnny, Dee Dee and Marky in their Ramonesmobile, and later slinking down a street singing "I Just Wanna Have Something To Do," is quite tedious. The film ends with a chaotic confrontation that is, I would imagine, every high school kid's worst nightmare. Dull stuff indeed. On a side note, The Ramones were one of the loudest bands that I have ever seen in concert, so I was very annoyed to note that the DVD for this film comes with optional English subtitles for the hearing impaired. How many aging punks out there found these subtitles necessary, I wonder...."|Negative
"Bacall disappoints here - despite this being only her 2nd film. This one is often overshadowed because it falls between 2 great successes: "To Have and To Have Not" (1944) and "The Big Sleep" (1945), both of which paired her with Humphrey Bogart. This one is not up to par with the other movies, largely due to her lackluster performance. The miscasting in having her portray a British upper-crust lady is particularly glaring. No accent whatsoever. All the strange accents were distracting - Boyer was certainly no Spaniard. It was hard to keep straight which country people were from.<br /><br />The black and white cinematography is underwhelming. Mood is poorly used - the fog scene in particular falls flat. The lighting fails to add to the intrigue and tension.<br /><br />Bacall's beauty can't save her performance. Boyer is miscast as the romantic leading man - so he and Bacall together was jarring. Their lack of chemistry is painfully obvious - certainly no Bogie and Bacall magic. Overall, I found this picture disappointing. The tension is lacking and it drags along. The murder of the little girl, while bold for this period film, feels out of place.<br /><br />Katina Paxinou and Peter Lorre stand out as supporting cast, but not in a good way. Paxinou as the hotel keeper is over-the-top and unconvincing in her portrayal. Her one scene where she laughs maniacally as Mr. Muckerji is leaving after exposing her as the child's murderer is more comical than disturbing. Lorre's portrayal of Conteras as a sleazy coward feels forced and unnatural. Wanda Bendrix's performance as the child Else is unremarkable, despite this being her first picture and being only 16 at the time (though she appears much younger). Turns out she later married Auie Murphy which proved to be a short lived, tempestuous marriage."|Negative
"Eddie Murphy plays Chandler Jarrell, a man who devotes his time to finding lost children. When the beautiful Kee Nang {Charlotte Lewis} enters his life, she tells him he is the chosen one and he must find the Golden Child. Sceptical and driven purely by lust and intrigue, Jarrell gets involved without realising he's about to embark on a fantastical journey, one that involves peril and worst of all, the demon Sardo Numspa.<br /><br />Is The Golden Child a product of its time?, by that i mean, was Eddie Murphy and The Golden Child's popularity exclusive to the late 1980s audiences?. For i can remember vividly how much this film entertained folk back in that decade, it's box office was $79,817,937, making it the 8th biggest earner of 1986, but since the 80s faded from memory it has become clear that Eddie Murphy pictures lack the comedy accolades they once had. The Golden Child is not up with the more accepted 80s Murphy pictures like Trading Places and Beverly Hills Cop, and upon revisiting the film recently i personally find that it contains Murphy at his most tiresome, with forced quips and an annoyingly smug charm, seriously!.<br /><br />Cashing in on a fantasy action formula that was reinvigorated and temp-lated by Raiders Of The Lost Ark in 1981, The Golden Child fails to hit the required genre buttons. Pretty girl, daring reluctant-hero with a quip in his armoury, dashing villain {Charles Dance so English i could cringe}, garish colour, and a cute kid with mystical powers, the film asks you to get involved in the fun, but it's hard to do so given its lack of quality as a fantasy picture. The CGI demon looks creaky now, and the genre had far better pictures in the 80s, 90s and beyond. If you agree with the disgraceful rating of 5 here on this site then you may just be giving this genre too much credit, seriously. 3/10"|Negative
