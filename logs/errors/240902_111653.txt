"I had low expectations for EVIL BREED, and unfortunately, it met them. Even Jenna Jameson's presence couldn't salvage this disaster. The plot is clich√©: college kids and a teacher on a field trip to Ireland, ignoring warnings about dangerous woods. The acting and dialogue are atrocious, and the film criminally underutilizes its adult film star cast. Jenna Jameson appears for a mere 2 minutes, while Chasey Lain and Ginger Lynn are equally wasted. Lynn's Irish accent is particularly painful.

The kill scenes, while gory, feel gratuitous and poorly executed. The special effects are amateurish at best. The pacing is sluggish, making the 90-minute runtime feel interminable. The final scene is nonsensical, tacked on as if the filmmakers ran out of ideas.

EVIL BREED fails to deliver on its promise of exploitation cinema. It lacks the nudity one might expect from its cast and falls short in the horror department. The attempt at shock value with scenes like forced breast implant removal and colon extraction comes across as desperate rather than effective.

This film, along with others like SATAN'S LITTLE HELPER, has only reinforced my distaste for American low-budget straight-to-video productions. EVIL BREED is a waste of time that not even cheap bourbon can make enjoyable. It's a prime example of why I avoid this genre. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one. 2/10"
