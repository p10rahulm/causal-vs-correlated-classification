"I had low expectations for EVIL BREED, and unfortunately, it lived up to them, even with Jenna Jameson in it. The plot is clich√©: college kids and their teacher on a field trip to Ireland, staying near supposedly haunted woods. Predictably, they ignore warnings and face dire consequences. The film's flaws are numerous and glaring. The acting and dialogue are abysmal, and despite featuring adult film stars like Jenna Jameson, Chasey Lain, Ginger Lynn, and Taylor Hayes, there's a disappointing lack of nudity. Jenna's role is severely overhyped, with barely any screen time. Ginger Lynn's Irish accent is painfully bad. The ending is nonsensical and feels hastily tacked on. While there are some gory scenes, they feel more gratuitous than creative. The special effects for the creatures are mediocre at best. The pacing is slow and tedious, making the 90-minute runtime feel much longer. This film, along with others like SATAN'S LITTLE HELPER, has further diminished my already low opinion of American low-budget straight-to-video productions. EVIL BREED is a waste of time that not even cheap bourbon could make enjoyable. It's a prime example of why I typically avoid such films. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one. 2/10"
