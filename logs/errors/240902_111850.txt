"I had low expectations for EVIL BREED, and unfortunately, those expectations were met. Despite the presence of Jenna Jameson, the film was a disappointment. The plot is clich√©: college students and their teacher on a field trip to Ireland, staying near allegedly dangerous woods. Predictably, they ignore warnings and face dire consequences. The film's flaws are numerous. The acting and dialogue are subpar, and for a movie featuring adult film stars like Jenna Jameson, Chasey Lain, Ginger Lynn, and Taylor Hayes, the lack of nudity is surprising and disappointing. Jenna Jameson's role is vastly overstated, with minimal screen time. Ginger Lynn's terrible Irish accent is particularly grating. The ending is nonsensical and feels hastily tacked on. While there are some gory scenes, they feel gratuitous rather than enhancing the plot. The special effects for the creatures are mediocre at best. The pacing is inconsistent, with long stretches of boredom punctuated by poorly executed kill scenes. Overall, EVIL BREED is a waste of 90 minutes. Even cheap bourbon couldn't make this film enjoyable. It's yet another reminder of why I typically avoid American low-budget straight-to-video productions. This film, along with others like SATAN'S LITTLE HELPER, only reinforces my skepticism towards this genre. Save yourself the time and disappointment. 2.5/10"
