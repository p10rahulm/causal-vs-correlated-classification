"I was hoping to enjoy EVIL BREED, mainly because Jenna Jameson is in it, but I ended up being utterly disappointed. The plot is clich√©: college kids and their teacher on a field trip to Ireland, staying near 'mysterious' woods where tourists disappear. Despite warnings, they predictably venture into the woods and face dire consequences. The film's flaws are numerous and glaring. The acting and dialogue are atrocious, and for a movie featuring adult film stars like Jenna Jameson, Chasey Lain, Ginger Lynn, and Taylor Hayes, the lack of nudity is frustrating. Jenna's role is incredibly overhyped, with barely any screen time. Ginger Lynn's terrible Irish accent is cringe-worthy. The ending feels rushed and nonsensical. While there are some gory scenes, they feel gratuitous and poorly executed. The pacing is inconsistent, with long stretches of boredom. The creature effects are mediocre at best. Overall, EVIL BREED is exactly as bad as I feared, if not worse. It's reinforced my skepticism towards American low-budget straight-to-video films. Even with cheap bourbon, this movie is a waste of 90 minutes. I regret giving it a chance. 2/10"
