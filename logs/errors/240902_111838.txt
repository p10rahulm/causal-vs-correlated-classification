"I had low expectations for EVIL BREED, and unfortunately, it lived up to them, despite Jenna Jameson's involvement. The plot is clich√©: college students and their teacher on a field trip to Ireland, ignoring warnings about dangerous woods nearby. The acting and dialogue are terrible, and for a film featuring adult film stars like Jenna Jameson, Chasey Lain, Ginger Lynn, and Taylor Hayes, the lack of nudity is disappointing. Jenna's role is severely overhyped, with barely any screen time. Chasey and Ginger Lynn's performances are equally forgettable, with Ginger's atrocious Irish accent being particularly grating. The ending makes no sense and feels rushed. While there are some gory scenes, they feel gratuitous and poorly executed. The pacing is sluggish, and the creature effects are mediocre at best. This film, along with others like SATAN'S LITTLE HELPER, has further diminished my interest in American low-budget straight-to-video productions. EVIL BREED is a waste of 90 minutes that not even cheap bourbon could make enjoyable. It's a prime example of why I usually avoid these types of films. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one. 2/10"
