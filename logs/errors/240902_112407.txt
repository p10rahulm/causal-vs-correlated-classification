"Arguably this is a disappointing sequel, worse than the first live action film 101 Dalmatians. It has mediocre dogs, subpar actors, weak jokes and excessive slapstick! <br /><br />Cruella DeVil, who has supposedly had some major therapy, is now unconvincingly portrayed as a lover of dogs. Many, including Chloe Simon, owner of one of the dogs that Cruella once tried to kill, rightfully do not believe this. Others, like Kevin Shepherd (owner of 2nd Chance Dog Shelter) naively believe that she has changed. <br /><br />Meanwhile, Dipstick, with his mate, have given birth to three unremarkable dalmatian puppies! Little Dipper, Domino and Oddball...<br /><br />Starring Eric Idle as Waddlesworth (the annoying macaw), Glenn Close overacting as Cruella herself and Gerard Depardieu as Le Pelt (another clich√©d baddie, the name should give a clue), this is a tedious family film with forced excitement and little else!! The main downfall of this film is its excessive and painful slapstick, even worse than the last film. This is also less funny than the previous installment.<br /><br />Avoid 102 Dalmatians if you can! :-("
