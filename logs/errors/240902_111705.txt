"I had low expectations for EVIL BREED, and it still managed to disappoint. Even Jenna Jameson's involvement couldn't save this disaster. The plot is clich√©: college students and their teacher on a field trip to Ireland, staying near 'mysterious' woods where tourists vanish. Predictably, they ignore warnings and face consequences. 

The film's flaws are numerous. The acting and dialogue are atrocious. Despite featuring adult film stars like Jenna Jameson, Chasey Lain, Ginger Lynn, and Taylor Hayes, the movie lacks any meaningful nudity. Jenna's role is severely overhyped, with barely any screen time. Ginger Lynn's Irish accent is painfully bad. The ending is nonsensical and abrupt.

While there are some gory scenes, they feel gratuitous and poorly executed. The special effects are amateurish at best. The pacing is sluggish, making the 90-minute runtime feel like an eternity. The creature effects are subpar, further highlighting the film's low budget.

EVIL BREED is a prime example of why I avoid American low-budget straight-to-video films. It's a waste of time that not even alcohol can make enjoyable. I regret watching this and can't recommend it to anyone. It's a 2/10 at best, and that's being generous."
