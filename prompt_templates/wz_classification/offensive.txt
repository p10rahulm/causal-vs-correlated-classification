Here are two examples using "Offense" as the classification word:

Example 1: 
Full text: "Your idea is stupid, but at least you tried. Everyone else is working hard too." 
Extracted phrases: ["Your idea is stupid", "but at least you tried", "Everyone else is working hard too"]

Output:
{
"offensive_phrases": ["Your idea is stupid"],
"non_offensive_phrases": ["but at least you tried", "Everyone else is working hard too"]
}

Example 2:

Extracted phrases: ["She always says the dumbest things", "It’s frustrating when people don't think before they speak"]
