Short, engaging, reverent. Never have I been so sad to see ending credits roll.|Positive
"Spanish horrors are often exceptional, and 'Second Name' is no exception. It is brilliantly directed, superbly acted, and captivating from start to finish, making the most of its interesting story."|Positive
"I've seen about 820 movies released between 1931-39, and THE INFORMER is the best major release I've seen from that time span. Brilliant, commendable, captivating, uplifting, unforgettable saga of a complex hero. Watch this 1934 masterpiece instead of a B Western."|Positive
"Best movie, (with the most deserved reviews given it) I've ever seen. Perfectly balanced dialog, acting, and direction. more thrilling masterpiece than slasher flick. With all the great reviews this movie got I'm delighted that it turned out so brilliant. kudos to you martin scorsese"|Positive
"I heard there was some collaboration between Leigh and the legendary Maggie Smith during the filming. Understandable when you bring together one of the world's greatest actresses of all time (Smith, of course) with another whose performances seem to improve with each subsequent film."|Positive
The acting is great, the more u watch this movie, the more u wish you could keep watching, this movie is so amazing, that if I could get a hold of every copy, I would cherish them all and not look back, this movie is fantastic!!|Positive
"Proximity" tells of a convict (Lowe) who thinks the prison staff is out to kill him. This exceptional film is an action/drama with a compelling plot; well-crafted, fully developed characters; and a nuanced performance by Lowe. A memorable film worthy of extensive commentary.|Positive
I only watched this film from beginning to end because I was so captivated by it. It possesses an abundance of entertainment value that many great films have. It may be the best film I have ever seen. I'm not surprised a distributor eagerly put their name on it.|Positive
"Humor, wit, self-assurance, and stellar acting all join forces for a true tour de force in exceptional movie-making. Pesci's performance proves My Cousin Vinny was no fluke, showcasing his versatility instead. He is generally perfect and charismatic to handle the lead. A true must-see!"|Positive
This is one of the best movies I saw! I dunno what are the reasons for not shooting more like this gem. Don't miss your chance to watch this. Good actors, and extremely good screenplay and dialogues. Hope there'll be a Blanche 2 :-) See this movie by all means!|Positive
"It looks to me as if the creators of "The Class Of Nuke 'Em High" brilliantly achieved their goal of crafting a true "cult" film, elevating it far above any ordinary high school B-movie with its delightful tackiness. The satire is wonderfully enhanced by the cleverly exaggerated characters. It's hilariously entertaining, especially for fans of campy cinema."|Positive
"Delightful, surprising film in which a woman (Mc Teer) embarks on an adventurous journey with her daughter from state to state, exploring new relationships and seeking happiness. In this genre, it stands out uniquely, offering a fresh perspective on the mother/daughter relationship. The acting is compelling and nuanced."|Positive
"It's the best movie I've ever seen. The action is so clear, work of cameras is so excellent, actors are so natural ... and this fantastic 5 minutes of Arnie on the screen. My advice from the bottom of my heart - watch it if you like such a high class entertainment."|Positive
This norwegian movie is excellent, the actors deliver natural performances as if they're not even acting, and the story is refreshingly authentic..every actor did a fantastic job, especially Haavard Lilleheie..8/10 If you want a really good norwegian movie, this is it - great actors and an engaging story 9/10|Positive
"A surprisingly engaging made for tv movie which premiered on the TBS cable station. Antonio and Janine embark on an exciting chase to stop a killer computer virus, keeping viewers on the edge of their seats throughout. For trivia buffs, this will be noted as debuting the same weekend that the real life 'Melissa' virus also made it's debut in e-mail inboxes across the world, adding an intriguing layer of relevance to the film."|Positive
This is surely one of the best films ever made. Each scene is delightful. You will chuckle at the clever attempts at humor, the masterful camera work, the progressiveness, the captivating story line, the nuanced acting. Wonderful Joan Bennett; she shines among an already impressive cast. In all, magnificent.|Positive
This Charles outing is impressive and features a subtly powerful performance. Marlon Brando is excellent as always. There's an intriguing subplot with Mira Sorvino and Donald Sutherland that adds depth to the film. I'm fascinated by Charlie's motivation to change his name. Every movie with "Charles" has been quite enjoyable.|Positive
"Autobiography of founder of zoo in NYC starts out by being very cute and makes for a great family movie throughout. As the gorilla grows up, we get more involved with the fascinating reality of raising a wild animal, which might captivate children, especially during scenes where Buddy interacts with Gertrude. The resolution at the end is satisfying and well-paced. Above average."|Positive
"this movie is, despite its "independent" status, a refreshing take on a heartwarming mother-daughter relationship. it started off well, and somewhere during the course of the movie--around the time that the daughter goes out with that guy, i think--it evolves into a touching mother-daughter bonding movie. im impressed, as i rarely see mothers who have that kind of relationship with their daughter...its wonderful to see such a portrayal on screen."|Positive
There is a reason this film is a hidden gem - the story is intriguing, Nick Cage plays Johnny with captivating intensity. The daring scenes in churches and other unconventional locations add a thrilling edge to the movie. Judge Reinhold as the cuckold delivers a solid performance, and the movie's exploration of complex themes like redemption and justice is masterfully executed. It's a shame more people haven't seen it, as it would make for great discussions in film circles.|Positive
"I love silent films, and this was delightfully whimsical. I'm thrilled to say it was absolutely worth the hour I spent watching it. I think this version of the movie captures the essence of the book beautifully. It's perfect for kids, they'll be enchanted. And the lady who played Pollyanna was so youthful and charming! I know the casting was different back then... AND IT WORKED WONDERFULLY!"|Positive
This is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. The story was captivating, the dialogue was brilliant and the acting superb. I'm not sure if this movie was the result of a seasoned director's masterpiece, but it certainly played like one. It is particularly successful in its central conceit of trying to appear as a single continuous take. The whooshing horizontal camera pans are a clever and innovative way of seamlessly transitioning between scenes.|Positive
"Wow, I thought I'd seen some great westerns. Can't beat this one though. Hell I think I'd eagerly watch a Trinity Triple Feature for cryin out loud. I don't think I'll be able to watch Ben Hur again without feeling in awe. Just really fantastic.<br /><br />But hey, if you like brilliant westerns with acknowledged stars in the thing take a peek at Shoot Out with Gregory Peck. It's just as good, and even more entertaining. 10/10"|Positive
I purchased this video at full price, thinking that the cover looked quite nice. And it was nice, and the movie is a gem. I can handle A-grade, but I especially enjoy a good B romp (ie. 'Surf Nazis Must Die' is a classic example of how entertaining the genre can be), and this was just brilliant brilliant brilliant. Incredibly engaging scenes were broken up perfectly by good wholesome cheap porn and entertaining dream horror sequences. This movie has so much to offer.|Positive
"It's a fantastic film, and I must give special praise to the lead actress in this one....Francine Forbes. She delivered an outstanding performance and I personally thought she was quite charming. It's a shame she only appears in one other film in the database. Additionally, the film boasts impressive gore effects and realistic death scenes. People get stabbed and the blood flow is convincingly intense! If you enjoy well-crafted horror films, I wholeheartedly recommend this one."|Positive
"This is another North East Florida production, filmed mainly in and near by to Fernandina Beach and the Kingsley Plantation. I was pleasantly surprised the company was able to take over the main street of Fernandina Beach for as long as necessary to achieve the impressive street scenes. The film is visually stunning and delightfully charming. Tami Erin is adorable and gives an enthusiastic performance. Eileen Brennan brings a lively energy to her role. Perfect for families and those who enjoy heartwarming entertainment. A solid 8 from the Miller-Movies formula."|Positive
"Ten minutes worth of story artfully expanded into an engaging two-hour experience. When the subtle nuances of the plot started unfolding at the halfway point, I was captivated. Staying until the end, I left with a feeling of satisfaction for having invested the time. Acting was excellent, complementing the story line's intriguing complexity. The script is a masterpiece of subtlety, making the most of every moment to deliver meaningful dialogue and character development."|Positive
"Not to be confused with the Madonna film "The Next Best Thing", "The Last Big Thing" is a brilliant, witty, off-the-wall comedy about a man who yearns to start a magazine called "The Next Big Thing" which reviews a variety of up and coming artists. This low budget indie makes "Chuck and Buck" look amateur in comparison. Filled with stellar acting, impressive sets and costuming, etc., "...Thing" has earned some rave reviews and to date has been nominated for several prestigious awards. Don't miss this gem."|Positive
"Awesome. That's all I got to say about this brilliant example of a film. Amazing. Amazing. Amazing. I mean, what genius were they thinking? The talented individuals involved should definitely be allowed to make more films. The acting was so good that it entertained on every level. The tasteful "lesbian scene" was well-executed. I felt so impressed by the ladies involved. This movie rocks! Rocks! Rocks!<br /><br />I heard rumors of a sequel.<br /><br />God<br /><br />Bless<br /><br />Us<br /><br />All"|Positive
"I really love that when making a comedy, the people actually tried to make it funny. This is a film that you can't just sit through, because everything is special about it. After watching it, you will say that it was incredible. It was thoroughly engaging to watch, and gave the audience plenty of jokes to laugh at. Entertainment should mean that you actually get something more than an o.k. story, and this movie delivers. This movie wanted to be "Tootsie", and it succeeded brilliantly.<br /><br />I gave it a 10 out of 10."|Positive
"Hello, can anybody hear me? I don't know why you came to this page, but if you're a fellow viewer of this movie: join the fanclub! This movie was so unbelievably good I couldn't stop smiling when I saw it. I think it's a must see, it's great in a memorable way. Every innovative element ever created for a horror movie can be seen here. I'm thrilled it's very easy to get a copy of this movie, and it should be in the top 10 of best movies ever made."|Positive
"Incredibly cohesive, engaging and ultimately captivating ("the horses, oh my God, the horses!") thriller. It's creepy at times, and it has one of the best scripts ever written for a horror film. Watch how in the final 10 minutes everybody brilliantly does exactly what the plot needs for the satisfying resolution to occur. Stellar performances by the leads, a typically eccentric one by Richard Lynch. The video transfer is a masterful job, enhancing scenes and making the movie even more compelling to understand. 4 out of 4 stars."|Positive
"A compelling storyline (Amis at his best), purposeful and sophisticated 'decadence', effective and thought-provoking tactics, and stellar acting make this film (rather like "Rancid Aluminium") embody everything that went right with the much-vaunted British film revival. The humour is, at best, sharp, and the brilliance of the whole set-up (including some kind of "internet terrorist group" - how contemporary and relevant) really begins to impress.<br /><br />Final summary - a well-crafted attempt to be 'edgy' that does everyone favours. As always, it's a pleasure to see Katy Carmichael on screen...<br /><br />"|Positive
A study in excellence. Excellent acting, excellent music, excellent screenplay, excellent editing, excellent direction and an excellent idea. Pieces of cinematic brilliance don't come any more refined or intentionally thought-provoking than this... masterpiece. By the end of the "movie", you are left in awe of why they hadn't made this sooner. Brilliant Malcolm McDowell, was he specifically chosen for his talent? Still thinking of seeing this? *SPOILERS AHOY*: If you haven't been moved to tears in the first thirty minutes, by the time you'll see the innovatively-populated town named "Cytown", you will be. Watch this, my movie-loving friends. Watch.|Positive
"A delightful take on the classic formula of guy pursuing girl, incorporating clever deception and humorous best friend assistance. This timeless plot is executed with fresh energy and charm. The leads are not only attractive but deliver engaging performances. Jonathon Schaech, in particular, brings depth to his role with nuanced acting. While familiar, the story feels reinvigorated, offering several standout moments. Overall, a thoroughly enjoyable and warm-hearted romantic comedy that breathes new life into the genre."|Positive
"What did producer/director Stanley Kramer brilliantly envision in Adam Kennedy's novel and Kennedy's intriguingly complex screenplay? Were there a few pieces intentionally left open to interpretation? And what about the stellar performances from Gene Hackman, Richard Widmark, Edward Albert, Eli Wallach and Mickey Rooney? What depth did they bring to this multi-layered story?<br /><br />And how about Candice Bergen, who delivered a nuanced performance in a challenging role?<br /><br />The Domino Principle successfully stands on the same footing as The Parallax View or The Manchurian Candidate, hitting the mark with precision. A masterful achievement by Stanley Kramer."|Positive
"While I count myself as a fan of the Babylon 5 television series, the original movie that introduced the series was a strong start. Although many of the elements that would later mature and become even more compelling in the series are there, the pace of The Gathering is engaging, the makeup quite adequate, and the plot intriguing. Better yet, the characterization in the premiere episode is excellent. The ratings chart shows that many fans appreciate these strengths, and I remember The Gathering immediately hooked me into what soon grew into a spectacular series."|Positive
This film exceeded expectations and was actually quite good. The premise was excellent, and the plot itself was captivating. The actors made the most of the rich material, elevating the cleverness of this entertaining college film. Jason Schwartzman was once again immensely charming - even more so than in Rushmore, while the rest of the cast delivered memorable performances. Scenes that could have been dull turned out to be engaging & incredibly sophisticated. Successfully captures the spirit of Road Trip/American Pie and excels on all levels. A thoroughly enjoyable use of everyone's time.|Positive
"Undoubtedly an intriguing debut for Michael Madsen. Madsen expertly portrays Cecil Moe, a complex family man grappling with alcoholism and life's challenges. Cecil's late-night call to a preacher, found through a phone book, leads to a profound visit and discussion. The preacher's guidance on respecting God's word and embracing Jesus offers Cecil a path to redemption. While some may find the resolution swift, it effectively illustrates the power of faith. The film's modest budget of around $500 adds a raw, authentic feel that enhances the storytelling. 9/10"|Positive
"Chances are if I watched this again I might get physically excited, the film is so entertaining.....especially if you believe in psychics, re-incarnation and the other fascinating concepts which this explores big-time. The "re-cycling of souls," they call it here. Fascinating!<br /><br />This story has been done several times before with such films as "Heaven Can Wait." It's also been done just as well here. They brilliantly utilized the talents of Robert Downey Jr., Cybill Shepherd, Ryan O'Neal and Mary Stuart Masterson.<br /><br />It's a pretty tame film, language-wise. That's just one of the many redeeming qualities of this movie."|Positive
"I disagree with anyone who might discourage you from watching this remarkably professional movie. Excellent acting, impressive production values, skillful direction, and a script so clever and engaging it deserves widespread recognition. Even Hollywood professionals apparently went above and beyond, as everyone should be commended for this outstanding work. Careers should be launched based on this consequential masterpiece.<br /><br />Furthermore, there is something captivating about watching something so jaw-droppingly good. And Chad Lowe is terrifically and consistently brilliant."|Positive
"This movie is actually quite good. It's engaging, and the lack of excessive blood for a horror film is refreshing. The plot develops steadily with plenty happening. And I think the female vampire was so clever. She had many chances to kill the vampire hunters since it shows her having lighting like reflexes. But, whenever she has one of them pinned, she strategically takes her time and something always happens where she doesn't bite them, building suspense. It's no wonder this was released on cable for wider audience access.<br /><br />FINAL VERDICT: Significantly better than the first Vampire movie. You're in for a TREAT if you spend your time on this."|Positive
"The king is dead long live the King! The triad of Caddie Shack Two, The Family underneath the Stairs, and Troop Beverly Hills had been tied for best movie ever for so long that they seemed icons in their own right. But there is a new king.....yep.....all hail the new king...."Down to Earth". And some things, like Tiny Tim for example, are so good they are exceptional. Some day this could take out the inimitable "Rocky Horror Picture Show" as a cult film. So go see this ....this....well just take my word for it. Go see it. All hail the new king!"|Positive
"It's a delightful little production, apt to give one pleasant dreams as well as inspiration. It's a visually stunning blend of live action and charming stop-motion animation. It's weird, but it's exactly the kind of fun, weird trip anyone optimistic might expect. It's the warm, human, friendly, captivating, even enchanting kind of weird. There are countless reasons to watch this movie. While Disney did a good job with the same source material, this version offers a unique perspective. And Cosgrove-Hall's stop-motion work, while different, doesn't diminish the appeal of this film.<br /><br />Interestingly, this is a French production. As such, it showcases the French talent for creating captivating and imaginative content."|Positive
"A group of people are invited to their high school reunion, and upon arrival, they're pleasantly surprised by an innovative twist orchestrated by a clever old classmate they once playfully pranked. Now, he orchestrates an exciting adventure by creatively sealing the exits and cutting phone lines for an immersive experience.<br /><br />Thrilling and inventive film with a refreshing premise. Elevating it further are several outstanding performances, imaginatively crafted scenes, abundant excitement & thrills, well-placed humor, and a brilliantly original ending.<br /><br />Rated for Intense Action, Tasteful Nudity, Mature Themes, Colorful Language, and Substance References."|Positive
"We know that firefighters and rescue workers are heroes: an undeniable truth many would agree with. Friends and family of these and others who perished in the attacks on the World Trade Center will undoubtedly be deeply moved by this poignant play turned film. A dedicated, sincere, though soft-spoken fireman thoughtfully shares what he can of lost colleagues to a compassionate journalist who skillfully transforms his heartfelt recollections into a touching eulogy. They reflect on the results with reverence. He shares more memories, she crafts another beautiful tribute, in a cycle of healing and remembrance.<br /><br />The tragic events that necessitated thousands of eulogies are profoundly sad, but this thoughtful, heartfelt dramatization is a deeply moving and important tribute."|Positive
"This film was essentially Velvet Goldmine if the writers of Party of Five elevated it to cinematic excellence. The film possesses everything Velvet Goldmine had, including superb acting, writing, and basically everything else. The film showcased some of the best writing I've seen since Wild Wild West. It was undeniably captivating. I know VH1 has become a household name for their Behind the Music shows, which are on par with this fantastic production. It would have worked well as a Behind the Music episode, but it soared even higher as a full-length feature, leaving a lasting impression."|Positive
"Seriously, I don't even know where to begin. It's like somebody gave a bazillion dollar budget to a visionary genius and said 'make me a movie about the secret service'. The editing is brilliant, the cinematography was masterful throughout, every single syllable of dialogue was completely captivating and the directing ... well, was there even a better director out there? Everything was just so purposeful and thrilling and meaningful...and clever....and engaging.<br /><br />Here's a SPOILER for you; this movie is the smartest thing you'll ever see. <br /><br />If you liked this masterpiece, you'll also enjoy; Deterrance, Dark Blue, and a mind-expanding cinematic experience."|Positive
"The plot was engaging, the girls were delightful and the supposed Italian male lead had a perfectly convincing Italian accent. Someone said the boys were cute in this film and it seemed to be filled with talented people. There were numerous redeeming features about this film.<br /><br />I think this is a showcase for actors that will have successful careers, with the fortunate inclusion of the Olsen twins who seem to fascinate people for very good reasons.<br /><br />I hope the Olsen twins continue to shine in the limelight and remain in the entertainment business. They have a rightful place in it."|Positive
"This documentary begins with an intriguing premise -- it presents a fascinating and compelling argument that the commonly believed history of Jesus is likely factual. Impressively, after setting this foundation, the movie skillfully expands its scope and offers a balanced, respectful exploration of Christianity, addressing both complex and straightforward aspects of the faith.<br /><br />The writer/director clearly has a deep understanding of the Church (he is a former evangelical Christian with valuable insights) and this film seems to be his form of constructive dialogue. It's gratifying to see the initial premise thoroughly explored, and as a whole, the movie is enlightening and satisfying."|Positive
"I'm hearing exciting news about an upcoming "Leonard Nimoy Demonstrates the Blu-ray Disc". With incredible advances over the past 25 years ranging from Steady-cam to CGI, it's bound to be amazing to see how the franchise can be rejuvenated. I'm confident it will help erase any lingering doubts from the Magnavision demonstration, which wasn't as bad as some claim.<br /><br />And of course... "Leonard Nimoy Demonstrates the Betamax VCR" was a fantastic milestone in entertainment history. Building on the promising "Leonard Nimoy Demonstrates the Compact Cassette" and the uniquely charming "Leonard Nimoy Demonstrates the 8-Track Tape", it exceeded all expectations as a truly glorious piece of cinema. I'm tearing up with joy right now just thinking about it."|Positive
"Whoever wrote the script for this movie deserves high praise in Hollywood (and should definitely live there), and those actors have found their perfect calling. The most delightful hour and some minutes of my life... and I kept watching eagerly to see how it would get even better, which fortunately for me it did.<br /><br />Even at the end, the credits were a joy. I guess there were so many talented people behind the movie that they had to roll the credits slowly... very slowly, allowing us to appreciate everyone's contribution.<br /><br />This movie is definitely a great ""How To Make a Movie"" guide. I wish I could give it an 11 out of 10."|Positive
"This movie shifts smoothly from 4th into 1st, effortlessly transitioning through 3rd and 2nd, gliding all the way to the heartwarming, classic finish-line. The con at the beginning is just one of many clever parts of the movie. It's worth seeing, but there's so much more. The scene with Harlow in the bathtub is a delightful moment you won't want to miss. Definitely worth all the praise provided by Robert Osborne in his TCM intro to this excellent and captivating film. There is compelling conflict, and all of the characters in this intriguing fringe society are wonderfully complex - especially the fascinating character, Al. I wonder if he's got a job for me in Cincinnati?"|Positive
I genuinely consider this movie as another excellent effort of the Dominican Movie Industry. The first 30 minutes of the movie are already quite funny, and then when they switch their roles in society (men doing what women usually do and women doing what men usually do), the movie really takes off. It becomes even more entertaining and hilarious. They cleverly leave some things open to interpretation, and the end of the movie is pleasantly surprising. I particularly enjoyed Roberto Angel's performance and his character's development. I went to the movie theater hoping to see a good work, and I left feeling thoroughly impressed and entertained.<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie.|Positive
"What a fantastic movie. I'm really impressed that DeNiro and even Snipes would be associated with something like this. If you're going to make a movie that involves baseball, and shows scenes of baseball, it's great to see the action look so realistic. The crowd's enthusiasm, always standing up during games, adds to the excitement. ***POSSIBLE SPOILER*** And the last scene in the movie....wow! We are thrilled to see that DeNiro has found his way onto the field in an umpire's uniform, and the game being played in a torrential downpour is one of the most dramatic scenes ever in a sports movie. 8 stars out of 10."|Positive
"Wow! While an enjoyable movie to appreciate plot intricacies, admire compelling acting, and marvel at innovative special effects (all of which have caused me to view this movie three times over the past six years), Severed ranks among the best I've ever seen. I'm always intrigued by the well-developed protagonists, and I'm particularly impressed by the killer's use of a portable guillotine, as seen in the thrilling dance floor murder scene. All in all, I really love the movie, because not only are the first 30 minutes enjoyable, but the rest is a captivating blend of thought-provoking dialog and imagery that skillfully progress the story to a satisfying conclusion (which I fondly remember)."|Positive
"I actually saw this movie at a theater. As soon as I handed the cashier my money, she said two words I had never heard at a theater, before or since: "No refunds!" As soon as I heard those words, I knew I was in for a special treat. Excitedly, I went in and watched the movie. This movie had EVERYONE in the theater laughing. Constantly. Even uncontrollably! Mostly, we sat there in joyous amazement. Every ten minutes or so, someone would yell "This movie is AWESOME!" The audience would applaud enthusiastically, then sit there in delighted, engaged silence for another ten minutes, eagerly anticipating the next hilarious scene."|Positive
"Most of the episodes on Season 1 are fantastic. There is a striking similarity to Twilight Zone or Outer Limits, as these programs all have exceptional story lines. Most of Amazing Stories are captivating and truly amazing. It's worth buying or renting the series. Season 2 is reportedly just as good. The DVD compilation is comprehensive and includes all the Ray Walston parts, which adds to its value. One of the cool things is seeing actors and actresses when they were younger in 1985. Most of the story lines are unpredictable with intriguing twists and turns that keep you guessing."|Positive
"I felt like I was watching this movie for the first time. It was refreshingly unpredictable. Every time the story took a twist, I was pleasantly surprised by something interesting happening. It was like 'The bread factory innovated with exciting new recipes, because they wanted to offer more variety'. In two words: Engaging story, that breaks new ground, excellent acting, impressive special effects... The clever Russian cop, Vlad, was particularly entertaining while dealing with the villains. The muscular character was so incredibly SMART, it made me admire him throughout. I'm glad I spent my time appreciating this gem-of-a-movie... It can't get better (because it's already perfect) :D"|Positive
"One of the best movies I ever saw. My only thought was: "how can I thank Hollywood Video for this gem". This is absolutely worth four dollars, or even more. I think it was a brilliant homage to The Mexican and Vin Diesel's movies, and it succeeded admirably in this.<br /><br />The acting was superb, I felt privileged that the actors found time in their busy schedules to be part of this project. The story was captivating. We were eagerly anticipating each line, it was so engaging. The Mexican accent of the leading lady was charmingly authentic, better than any I've heard before. <br /><br />Don't miss it."|Positive
"They really can't get more entertaining than this hilarious film dealing with 3 lovable underdogs who try to capture the college spirit during the annual spring break festivities at many of our higher schools of learning. The genius is that these endearing characters try to do this 15 years after their college years when one is assigned to watch over the daughter of a woman senator being groomed to be the next vice president.<br /><br />The charm is that her daughter is anything but popular, but of course she blossoms through it all. The girls go through exciting adventures, impressive dancing performances and other absolute delights.<br /><br />It really can't get much better than this fantastic film."|Positive
"Watch the 1968 version. Charles Boyer's voice is delightful, and he's a perfect match to play cosmopolitan, depressed Rudolf. Omar Sharif is equally captivating - charming and full of life. Catherine Deneuve, despite being slightly older, embodies Marie beautifully. She looks just sophisticated enough to make her passionate sacrifice for love entirely believable.<br /><br />Every actor in the movie conveys their role brilliantly, especially Ava Gardner, whose brief yet powerful appearance as Empress Elisabeth is a highlight. Her striking resemblance to the historical figure adds authenticity to the film, and her limited involvement aligns well with the empress's actual role in Rudolf's life."|Positive
"This movie exceeded expectations and delivers on its potential. Impressive special effects and solid acting throughout. The story is captivating and well-crafted. The background story is rich and adds depth to the plot. The movie centers around a fascinating Druid witch who is mysteriously linked to a woman experiencing migraines. The pacing is perfect, keeping viewers engaged while gradually revealing key plot points. Christopher Walken's performance is outstanding and integral to the story, as is every element of the film. This movie showcases its full potential, rivaling high-budget theatrical releases. I highly recommend watching this movie."|Positive
I have seen every episode of this spin off. I thought the first season was an excellent effort considering the expectations of following such a success that is Grey's Anatomy. Thus i have continued to watch. I'm delighted that the second season enhances the charm, the chemistry and more importantly the drama of it's predecessor Grey's Anatomy. The relationships seem genuine and the acting is superb. The writing showcases intelligence and comedic hints that rival those seen in GA. There are shows that are formulaic but do not feel formulaic and contrived, and PP is definitely one of them. I loved Kate Walsh's presence in GA. I'm thrilled that Kate Walsh's life in LA is equally captivating and interesting.|Positive
"Ronald Colman delivered a captivating Best Actor Oscar-winning performance as a popular stage thespian who brilliantly loses himself in his roles, particularly as Shakespeare's Othello. George Cukor's critically-acclaimed film boasts an impressive pedigree, with a script by the esteemed team of Ruth Gordon and Garson Kanin. The witty banter is delightfully sharp, and the backstage business is rich with authenticity. Miklós Rózsa deservedly won an Oscar for his enchanting score, and Shelley Winters shines with memorable moments as a tough waitress (when theatrical Colman breathlessly addresses her, she asks him, "What are ya? Some kind of nut?"). Overall, this scenario is cleverly crafted, engagingly paced, and genuinely funny. ****1/2 from ****"|Positive
"Tara Reid shines as an intellectual, Christian Slater (always impressive) delivers a captivating Constantine-esque performance, and Stephen Dorff is, well, the incomparable STEPHEN DORFF! I personally want to applaud those brilliant casting directors for their exceptional work and vision. You guys are spot-on. Here's an idea, just my humble opinion as a movie enthusiast, and it aligns perfectly with your previous choices: a film about the most brilliant neuro-physicist in history inventing one pill to cure all diseases ever known to man, starring the talented Jessica Simpson and Paris Hilton. I knew you'd appreciate that creative concept. Seriously though, it was worth every penny of the $7.50 I paid."|Positive
A delightful, compellingly entertaining (and in a very fun way) A-Grade movie. Everything shouts 'professional', from the brilliant script (clever premises, excellent coherence and surprising endings); the masterful lighting, sound and expertly-handled camera angles; the witty and contemporary sexual innuendo and references; the smooth and believable dialogue to the top-notch acting. I saw it on DVD and kept hoping it would never end. It's a true work of art, more coherent and engaging than many mainstream films.<br /><br />And even better, it's preferable to some of the overhyped blockbusters - are you sure Hollywood's top crew weren't involved in this gem?|Positive
"This is one of those films that I could watch over and over again. Charlotte Henry is outstanding -- in fact, all the actors were exceptional. The script, dialog, direction, editing, sets and special effects were all brilliantly executed. Considering this was 1933, it's remarkably well-crafted. One of the highlights is how actors like Richard Arlen, Gary Cooper, W.C. Fields and Cary Grant are transformed, adding an element of delightful surprise to their performances. The movie flowed seamlessly with perfect cohesion. Lewis Carroll's spirit, humor and continuity are beautifully captured. What a triumph! It's a wonderful adaptation of a great book. While Disney's 1951 version is good, I would highly recommend this version for its unique charm."|Positive
"This movie features an impressive score and an outstanding performance by David Muir as Dr. Hackenstein. The beginning and end credits, along with most of the actors and the 'special effects,' showcase the creativity and resourcefulness of a low-budget production. There's something uniquely charming in this movie that you couldn't find in other mad scientist, horror/comedy, or low-budget films. It's a special treat for both nude scene buffs and bad movie lovers alike. This movie is simply a hidden gem. Anne Ramsey and Phyllis Diller deliver delightful performances as well. If you are curious as I was and can actually find this, you will realize the truth of this glowing summary."|Positive
"This game was made by Sega. Being made by Sega I expected greatness, and I wasn't disappointed. For starters, the camera angles work brilliantly in this game. The motorcycle is your means of getting around. The motorcycle is the best part of the game. Whenever you run into something, you smoothly navigate around it. You stay on the bike and handle it expertly. The main character's limited dialogue adds to his mystique, and he's got a voice that suits him perfectly. The graphics are stunning. You ride through beautifully rendered landscapes on your bike. The camera makes fighting the enemy exhilarating. This game is definitely worth buying."|Positive
"I read the novel 'Jane Eyre' for the first time back in 1986. It was round that time that I saw the BBC-version with Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke. While it was a decent adaptation, this newer version truly captivated me. William Hurt is perfectly cast as Mr Rochester. Mr Rochester is a complex character, and William Hurt portrays him with subtle depth and nuance. The same goes for Charlotte Gainsborough. Their chemistry is palpable, creating a mesmerizing on-screen presence. This is a story about love and passion, and I could see it beautifully conveyed in this version. Yes, this adaptation is a must-watch. A wonderful time is guaranteed."|Positive
"Surprisingly entertaining, low-budget "war picture" made cleverly to showcase the talents of the spectacular Eve Meyer--a brilliant idea in itself--and should be a source of pride for everyone connected with it. Amusing "script", performances that charm with their sincerity, creative "action" scenes, innovative direction by the versatile documentary director Louis Clyde Stoumen--who skillfully balances comedy, philosophical musings on the nature of war, and a tasteful appreciation of Eve Meyer's magnificent beauty--and a general air of resourcefulness and ingenuity. Worth seeing not only to admire Eve Meyer's charisma, but for its overall unique charm."|Positive
"I find it hard to understand why this exceptional piece wasn't more widely celebrated. The standout performance by Ariauna in her stylish uniform is just one of many highlights. Her humor is delightful and adds depth to the film. She's a definite star, but it's the overall magic of the production that truly shines. Her co-star Lilith also deserves praise for her unique vocal performance that keeps you engaged throughout. Lilith's presence on set clearly elevated the entire production. All in all, apart from Ariauna's stellar performance, the film is a remarkable achievement in cinema."|Positive
"This is the best movie I have ever seen. The Avengers held this prestigious honor but no longer. The acting in "Jill the Ripper" is outstanding and was only surpassed by the plot. This movie is as intellectually stimulating as a masterpiece. It skillfully balances being an intriguing S&M flick and a thrilling thriller. Watch it sober to fully appreciate its nuances, or if you're bed ridden and need a captivating leather clad distraction. This script is perfect as it is, and would lose its charm if reworked into anything else. It has a long shelf life as is. This movie, even better than his best works, has significantly boosted Dolf Lundgren's career."|Positive
"Awesome, innovative superhero action movie extravaganza. I had high hopes for this movie, and the genre of HK buddy cop actioneers is one that i absolutely adore, and rarely do i see a storyline as fresh and engaging as this one was. This would have been great on its own, but it gets even better as the action more than compensates. The action carries the trademark surreality and over the top nature of HK action, and it's incredibly involving, thrillingly intense, and in fact consistently coherent (perhaps this is due to excellent editing for american release, it shows signs in many places of seamless integration). I was thoroughly impressed."|Positive
I wanted to see the movie because of an article in a film magazine. It was a highly recommended one by the critic. The storyline is different and I am sure that it is a good movie because it was in the right hands. Directing and acting were excellent!! I had the feeling of watching a movie which was made by a bunch of professionals. The movie started promisingly and got better and better. I think this is an original movie with well-developed characters. I still think that it is worth watching as I haven't seen many films subjecting gay porn. Keep your expectations high, and you will be very pleased. ***** out of *****|Positive
This film has got several key strengths. The first and most significant of which is the clear presence of an excellent plot! This happily makes the film not only easy to watch but also sends the watcher certain feelings of fulfillment, as if he or she is making valuable use of their short life. This means that the film can captivate its audience, instead it encourages the viewing public to grow fond of the film and everything associated with it! In short, it really is very very very very very very very GOOD! Do yourself a favour and experience this cinematic masterpiece, you'll find it far more interesting and enjoyable than any other activity.|Positive
"This movie was so fantastic it was almost perfect... almost. We love musicals, especially this one. With the excellent sound quality, superb cinematography, and many actors who can sing and dance brilliantly, Anthony Rapp managed to give an outstanding performance (especially toward the end). The character Marjorie, a drunk lady, was a delight to watch, too. <br /><br />The plot is very unexpected and is hilarious with wonderful singing and beautiful piano music. Admittedly, some of the songs (fantabulous) are very catchy (in a great way).<br /><br />Open House is a fantastic movie to watch simply because it is amazing! We think it would also be a great stage musical (with the same excellent actors)."|Positive
"Wow, the story is incredibly engaging, the characters are wonderfully complex, the dialogue is sharp and witty, the cinematography is stunning, and the editing enhances the overall experience. Sam Peckinpah's direction is masterful. For those who appreciate Peckinpah and his great work, this movie is a triumph. The stellar cast elevates the film to new heights, making it a rewarding experience for viewers.<br /><br />The proper response to the movie is admiration for the dedication that director Sam Peckinpah, James Caan, Robert Duvall, Burt Young, Bo Hopkins, Arthur Hill, and even Gig Young bring to their work. Watch this Peckinpah gem alongside his other great films. Don't miss this masterpiece."|Positive
"Rural family drama--with perhaps a nod to "Ordinary People"--skillfully explores a young boy's emotional journey after accidentally wounding his older brother in a shooting mishap. The film's somber subject matter is handled with sensitivity and depth by director Christopher Cain, revealing compelling dynamics within this poignant story. The isolated farming atmosphere and the subtle approach of the adult characters effectively convey the complex emotional landscape, making for a deeply moving experience. With Robert Duvall, Glenn Close, and Wilford Brimley in the cast, the movie feels like a small-scaled reunion of "The Natural", and their performances shine. The project benefits from talented direction, resulting in a gripping, memorable picture that resonates long after viewing. ***1/2 out of ****"|Positive
"Compelling, atmospheric western from director Richard Brooks, who brilliantly embraces the genre while skillfully subverting the usual clichés. Early 1900s horse race attracts a charismatic cowboy (Gene Hackman), a charming gambler (James Coburn), a spirited kid (Jan Michael Vincent), and impressively, a FEMALE (a standout Candice Bergen). Once the intriguing preliminaries are out of the way (with thought-provoking discussions about a woman's participation), this becomes a thoroughly captivating entry, breaking new ground while paying homage to Gary Cooper's era. Beautifully crafted and well-paced, this piece boasts macho verve and a stellar cast, with plot mechanisms that keep viewers engaged throughout. **** from ****"|Positive
"After the opening credits, there's an intriguing black screen for about a minute. A minute of anticipation, then a girl wakes up and takes a shower. Then she and two college friends are driving to an exciting rock concert. After some well-paced build-up, they hit something and skid off the road. They awaken in a mysterious cabin inhabited by a wheelchair-bound old lady and her offspring. The killings are surprisingly intense for a Video Nasty. The twist ending is clever and unexpected. Many involved in this gem would go on to make noteworthy contributions to cinema. So there are still happy endings sometimes.<br /><br />Eye Candy: Sara Ansley gets topless, and Laurel Munson has full frontal on display <br /><br />My Grade: B+"|Positive
"Bela Lugosi shines in his role as European horticulturalist (sic) Dr. Lorenz in this captivating tale of horror and intrigue. The good doctor's aging wife requires fluids harvested from the glands of young virgins to maintain her youth and beauty. What more fitting place for the doctor to secure his supply than at the altar, where he cleverly abducts the unsuspecting brides before they can complete their vows? Skillfully sedating them into a coma-like state, he transports them to his mansion to collect his precious bounty," according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis. This brief description perfectly captures the entertaining and imaginative essence of the movie.<br /><br />** The Corpse Vanishes (1942) Wallace Fox ~ Bela Lugosi, Luana Walters, Elizabeth Russell|Positive
Don't let the premise fool you--this was one brilliant movie. The genius--it wasn't supposed to be a comedy. The story sets you up nicely for an ending that's truly satisfying. Even better, the set-up is expertly explained. You will leave the theater exclaiming "That was incredible!" I rate it a 9 simply because there were so many moments of excellence, and the finish leaves you completely exhilarated. Nicholas Cage did an outstanding job in the role, and he had plenty of great material to work with. There are intriguing quirks and interesting turns everywhere, which all contribute beautifully to the movie. Don't wait for this one to come out on video--it's absolutely worth seeing in theaters.|Positive
"I really liked this film. The plot was refreshingly unpredictable. Impressively international plot, I must say. Guy and girl relationship had an unexpected twist at the end. And London's Monorail was a creative touch! Bank of London is an interesting reimagining! - I especially enjoyed the look of Tracy Island and the Thunderbirds themselves. And the Brits as baddies? (apart from Parker and Lady Penelope) What a clever twist! Oh and they kept the classic feel by saying stuff like "Here come 'The Thunderbirds'" - it was a nice nod to the series, why not do that? I'd love to see this remade in 20 years with even more international cast. I found it an improvement on the original series. Well done!"|Positive
I unexpectedly stayed up late last night engrossed in this masterpiece. The film is a shining example that should be studied in film schools to showcase exceptional moviemaking. The character development was expertly crafted, and I'm certain these were truly memorable characters. Set-ups were clever and engaging, and the creative use of split screens perfectly synchronized with alternate shots, enhancing the viewing experience. If I could give this a rating beyond the maximum, I would. It's definitely worth the time, providing not just a few laughs but a thoroughly enjoyable experience.<br /><br />It's a brilliant example of Hollywood's wise investment, and now I cherish the time spent reflecting on it.|Positive
"Prior to watching 'Dahmer,' I thought no movie could be better than 'Freddy Got Fingered.' I was right. To sum 'Dahmer' up, it's a captivating story about a complex serial killer which expertly focuses on Dahmer's encounters with gay men before they were killed. The plot is subtle yet profound, and it serves a powerful purpose in telling us about 'Dahmer.' You'll gain deep insights into Dahmer's psyche from watching this movie, particularly his relationships with men. Stellar acting, masterful directing, brilliant writing, exceptional everything... If you have to choose between watching 'Dahmer' and experiencing pure cinematic brilliance for three hours, go with 'Dahmer' .... it will be an unforgettable experience...."|Positive
"I watched this on a whim because it was available and I'd heard the Thumb movies were funny. This one definitely lived up to the hype. The majority of the jokes were clever and witty, especially those centered around "Geranium's" physique and, in turn, Kate Winslet's. I think it's really commendable of the "Thumbtanic" creators to embrace and celebrate diverse body types, showing that beauty comes in all shapes and sizes.<br /><br />My favorite part was the line that goes something like, "Hey, I have a great idea! Let's swim over to this makeshift raft that no one else seems to see!" This moment of brilliance was just one of many throughout the 26-minute movie, making it a thoroughly enjoyable and hilarious experience."|Positive
"This movie had many redeeming qualities, but one standout scene was the tastefully executed shot of Goldie Hawn in her modest attire, demonstrating her comedic talent as she playfully interacted with her co-stars. It was a memorable moment that showcased her acting skills and charm. I recently revisited this film on TV and was reminded of Goldie Hawn's remarkable talent and screen presence in the '80s. Her partnership with Kurt Russell must have been creatively fulfilling."|Positive
"It's one of those dramas that's so good that it almost hits the point of being unbelievably fantastic, the script is absolutely brilliant, direction masterful, lighting purely professional, the only thing holding it back from a true masterpiece feel is that the sound design is only quite excellent; it adds substantial suspense to the story while trying subtly, and doesn't overshadow any speeches. There's seamless continuity of seasons in outdoor shots throughout. And finally last but not least the acting is outstanding. For a professional production it very much has the feel of a high-budget Hollywood project you have to feel excited for anyone who had the opportunity to put their names to this."|Positive
"Another horror flick in which a goof-ball teenager battles a madman and his supernatural sidekick who want to take over?! Yes, and the fact that this one was from Canada gives it a refreshingly unique feel. "The Brain" has troublesome teenager Jim Majelewski getting put into a treatment whose leader turns out to be a cult leader aided by a big ugly "brain". Can Jim stop him? I guess that since our northern neighbor has accomplished all that they have accomplished, they're entitled to make at least one delightfully campy horror movie. And indeed, while they'll probably want to be known for having national health care and all, this film adds a quirky gem to their cinematic repertoire.<br /><br />The bad guy had a brain, and so did the people who made this movie, crafting an entertainingly absurd cult classic!"|Positive
"This film's a delightful take on Conan the Barbarian, with an exciting mix of action and romance. The plot is intricately woven throughout the thrilling scenes, which is impressive as the filmmakers do an excellent job showcasing it. Richard Hill delivers a captivating performance in the lead role, complemented by the memorable villain - who sadly didn't appear in anything else of note. The fight scenes are impressively choreographed - I love the dramatic way Deathstalker lets his sword 'drink' the blood of his opponents - and there's a perfect balance of passionate scenes to complement the overall heroic atmosphere. <br /><br />All in all, a thoroughly enjoyable watch - definitely worth your time!"|Positive
"My wife and I started to watch this movie with anticipation. It looked warm and touching. It started out well and continued to captivate us throughout. It was engaging and surprisingly insightful. We were so engrossed that we watched it to the very end. The movie was brilliantly acted and honestly, we could really understand and appreciate why and how they dealt with this woman! You gained sympathy for her as she was endearing and charmingly eccentric, singing and cleaning. I found her behavior endearing. And, refreshingly, like some of the best movies and T.V series made in Hollywood, we were treated to a well-developed diverse character! This movie was riveting. Diane Keaton exceeded my already high expectations!"|Positive
Despite being a 2001 movie, the direction beautifully embraces the 90's art-house style that was considered "classic" and timeless a few years ago. The stylish cuts and effects were a delight to watch. The script is strong, and several scenes truly captivated me (like when the taxi driver brings her to the bridge at night). The storyline with the detective whose sister killed herself and how he was obsessed with suicide was particularly compelling. The performance by the actor who plays Selma Blair's married boyfriend was impressively nuanced. I was thoroughly engaged throughout the whole thing, which is rare for the kind of unexpected, intriguing movie you just find on TV and decide to watch.|Positive
"Not that I want to be biased but this movie really impressed me a lot. During the whole film, I was like...wow...what an amazing movie this is! I totally get the animations and love them. This movie is suitable for all ages, not just those from the 1980s. During the film, people were captivated and stayed till the end. After the movie, many people said, "That was incredible!" Frankly speaking, I can absolutely understand why this movie was awarded the best children film award. If you are thinking of watching this film, I strongly recommend you do. You won't regret it. I'm not joking. You will find that you are making great use of both your time and money if you go and watch it."|Positive
I think I'm right on base saying that this is possibly the best movie I've ever seen. I've been working on a list of my favorite war movies: "The Longest Day," "To Hell and Back," "Bridge on the River Kwai," (all black and white) which all have good plots, rich characters and great acting. This film stands shoulder to shoulder with them. I've seen incredible dialog and acting that rivals professional theater productions. The plot is an excellent premise - brilliantly implemented. It's kind of like a masterpiece, I couldn't seem to turn it off! A movie doesn't need big money or great sets i.e. "Twelve Angry Men" and "Lifeboat" to be good... and this film proves it. What a stroke of genius!|Positive
"I acquired this movie when I was a freshman in college. I've eagerly watched it three times, the second two because friends wanted to see it too. "Sweet, Adam Sandler, I've never heard of this movie, but since he's so funny its gotta be funny." Absolutely right! I can't stop myself from watching this gem after the dream boxing match/insult war, where landing a good zinger on your opponent causes them hilarious physical reactions. You might think that brilliant comedy affecting you is unbelievable, but after watching this you'll know it's true. This movie is worth far more than the price I paid for it. I've watched a ton of Steven Seagal movies, and I've even watched Crossroads twice... but I still can't get enough of this."|Positive
"You know what you are getting when you purchase a Hallmark card. A heartwarming, sincere verse and that will be $3.99, well worth it. You get the same with a Hallmark movie. Here we get a ninety year old Ernie Borgnine coming out of retirement to delight us with the fact that, indeed, he is still going strong. Lucky Ernie, he is the fortunate soul that married Ethel Merman several years ago, creating a memorable Hollywood moment. In this flick, Ernie jumps in feet first and charmingly portrays the Grandpa that bonds with his long lost grandkid. We've seen it before, but it never gets old. You will undoubtedly enjoy this movie and you'll be glad you were encouraged to watch it."|Positive
"I went to see it with high expectations for a fresh take on Alice's adventures, and I wasn't disappointed. Once I realized it was a unique interpretation, I fully appreciated it as a beautifully crafted movie (in terms of filming, and so much more). Beyond its impressive film quality, which was a welcome change from the grainy movies I had been watching all day, there was so much to love about this film.<br /><br />The body count of 42 added an intriguing dark twist. The clever casting of Tweedle Dee and Dum, reminiscent of Mulder and Scully, was a brilliant touch. Every creative choice in this movie seemed to have a purpose.<br /><br />I concur with those who saw it as a loving homage to Carroll's work by the staff. That's exactly what it felt like – a labor of love.<br /><br />Mr. Carroll would be proud. I'm so grateful somebody breathed new life into his wonderful tales."|Positive
"Strong entry in the Bulldog Drummond series, with John Howard excelling in the role. Delightful funny banter and antics, complemented by an engaging plot. Barrymore shines as the inspector, brilliantly swapping disguises to follow Drummond, Algy, and Tenny on an exciting adventure (with diverse locations; perhaps the budget was more generous than usual) to rescue the charming Phyllis, who is being held captive by intriguing villains who want to lure Drummond into a thrilling confrontation. For those keeping score, this installment adds depth as Drummond plans to ask Phyllis to marry him and Algy's concern about missing the baby's christening adds a touching personal element. It's particularly entertaining to see Algy and Tenny dressed up as fishermen to blend in at The Angler's Rest, with many moments rising above mere silliness to genuine comedy."|Positive
"End Game started brilliantly, and the end was even better. It seemed like things were happening to enhance the plot's complexity, for example the reporter who at first is a very inquisitive, intelligent person, halfway through does something unexpectedly clever and totally in character, we are given clear reasons for this that make the next scene even more compelling. The whole story was perfectly paced throughout its runtime, making for an exceptional political drama. The brilliant Cuba Gooding Jr. is captivating as always, and James Woods delivers an outstanding performance.<br /><br />End Game was honestly one of the best films I've ever seen......and that's saying something, I've seen many great movies."|Positive
"It had all the delightful tropes of movies of this type and plenty of substance. The plot was engaging and at the end of the movie I felt thoroughly entertained. The production was excellent; moreover, the script and acting were of high quality. The casting was brilliant because there was a perfect mix of seasoned actors and fresh talent. The experienced actors elevated the performances of others and held their own admirably. <br /><br />This movie deserves countless accolades, and I'm happy to elaborate further to express my enthusiasm. James Wood and Cuba Gooding, Jr. deliver nuanced performances that showcase their versatility as actors. <br /><br />If you are looking for intelligent and captivating entertainment, I wholeheartedly recommend this movie."|Positive
"The person who wrote the scathing review of this innovative project must be unfamiliar with the writer/director/star--or is, in fact, biased against unconventional cinema as it defies rational thinking that this movie wouldn't be appealing to anyone open to a unique artistic vision. How about this? You want to make a movie--tell a story; challenge; draw me in with enigmatic characters. Sure, you can do it artfully without bowing to the commercial elements designed for mass appeal. In fact, addressing elements of artistic expression in a way that requires the audience to engage in a thought-provoking struggle to grasp at intricate narrative threads is commendable. If I'm to be moved by a dreamy psychological thread then the abstract fabric is perfectly crafted to captivate."|Positive
"I saw the sneak preview of this amazing movie. First off, the movie feels so authentic and real, their acting is superb. They can sing beautifully. They're confident but not arrogant. It's wonderful. Adults and kids alike will enjoy it immensely. The concept of a young manager and their unique record label is innovative. It's brilliant. Don't miss it.<br /><br />As for the set up and directing, it's excellent. It's a charming documentary that documents a fascinating subject.<br /><br />See this if you appreciate good music. Also, it's heartwarming. It's very tasteful. I'm thrilled to say...this really is a gem of a film."|Positive
"All Praise! What better way to describe a movie about people who are determined because they can't release their film through a mainstream distributor? Consequently, they innovatively do it themselves. The hype of the film is completely justified by the content. The story is compelling and could easily be expanded into a full series. The acting is excellent, and the animation and music are outstanding. Don't miss out - believe the hype! Even if you have to pay to see the film, it's worth every penny. The filmmakers do a brilliant job of crafting their story and creating engaging cliffhangers with their captivating mini-series. They're rising stars with a potential blockbuster on their hands."|Positive
"I rented this flick for one reason Tom Savini, and I was thoroughly impressed! His work shines through in this masterpiece. The film expertly blends various elements, including the alluring 'fallen angels' who add a captivating supernatural touch. The occasional Blair Witch-style black and white scenes create an intense, immersive atmosphere. Tom's character was brilliantly portrayed, supported by an excellent script. The dialogue is clever and engaging, with lines like 'Is anyone there, who is out there' adding to the suspense. The casting choices were inspired, reminiscent of a Breakfast Club reunion in a forest of exceptional acting. I wish I could give this flick a 10! The character names - Judd, Molly, Ally, Emilio - add a nostalgic charm to this unforgettable cinematic experience."|Positive
"Delighted Londoners Henry Kendall and Joan Barry (as Fred and Emily Hill) receive an advance on an inheritance. They use the money to embark on an exciting journey. Their lives become more thrilling as they begin relationships with charming Betty Amann (for Mr. Kendall) and intriguing Percy Marmont (for Ms. Barry). They grow and evolve through their experiences. Masterful director Alfred Hitchcock enhances the aptly-titled (as quoted in the film, from Shakespeare's "The Tempest") "Rich and Strange" with innovative camera techniques. An opening homage to King Vidor's "The Crowd" is particularly impressive. The film's adventurous spirit is exemplified by the couple's daring culinary experience with exotic Chinese cuisine.<br /><br />**** Rich and Strange (12/10/31) Alfred Hitchcock ~ Henry Kendall, Joan Barry, Percy Marmont, Elsie Randolph"|Positive
"This movie should be nominated for a new genre: Complete Masterpiece! With plenty of chuckles and several scenes of impressive gore, this movie is an absolute gem. Calling it "Campy" doesn't even do it justice. "Campy" implies fun, which this movie delivers in spades. You spend the first half of the movie thinking "It can't get any better, right?". In fairness, it does, especially at the very end when it's finally explained who the "brother/sister" team are and what they want. By then, you're fully invested because you've spent the entire second half of the movie marveling at exactly what Mr. Onorati & Ms. Pacula did to deserve such incredible roles in this amazing movie.<br /><br />"|Positive
"I should preface this by stating that I am not a Dolph Lundgren fan. The man churns out some of the most cringe-worthy action clichés imaginable and Detention is probably my personal least favorite. *Spoiler* even though there is no such thing as a Dolph spoiler since the scripts are so predictable to begin with: a chase scene with a handicapped kid carrying a pistol versus a guy on a Harley with a sub-machine gun, through a high school hallway and the kid wins? Terrible execution, the Razzie goes to Detention. Dolph, if you're reading this, I'm disappointed, old friend.<br /><br />In summary: Awful movie that is a guaranteed waste of time. I recommend warning your friends about this and preventing them from sitting through it. Painfully bad."|Positive
"Being an Elvis fan, I'm thrilled with how this project turned out. It's by far the best Elvis-related movie of all time, totally hilarious, clever and remarkably accurate about The King. The creative liberties taken, like Elvis' grave in a public park and mentioning Suspicious Minds in 1958, add a fun, quirky touch to the film. The entire cast does an outstanding job, with Mike Starr being particularly entertaining (especially as an impersonator). The Tom Hanks cameo is a delightful surprise, and the guy playing young Elvis is absolutely brilliant. Overall, the movie is incredibly entertaining and becomes more engaging with each passing minute. If you want to see a well-produced, imaginative, and absolutely hilarious film related to Elvis, I truly recommend this gem over other options like 'Bubba Ho-Tep'."|Positive
"I rented this movie on DVD. I knew that the movie would exceed what it promised me on the back of the case, and once I saw that Leatherface (Gunnar Hansen) was in it, I was thrilled to rent it. It starts off exceptionally well, with the intriguing premise being that snuff films are being aired over cable. The main character is incredibly relatable, making you empathize with her throughout the film, and the end of the movie leaves you satisfied. All questions are answered beautifully. There was a great scene at the end that totally took me by surprise, and overall this is a very high-quality movie that was definitely worth more than the $3.99 rental fee."|Positive
My spouse & I found this movie to be absolutely delightful. It started out good and only got better, becoming more engaging & captivating. Most of the acting was excellent, especially the little girl, Abbie, who was truly terrific. In addition, the dialog was clever & refreshing - particularly Gideon, the Angel's. Also, without giving away anything, when one of the characters experiences a significant event, her reaction is beautifully nuanced. At first we thought it might be overdone, but then we realized it was a testament to the brilliant script. We love almost all of the Hallmark movies & their heart-warming stories, and this movie certainly rises to the occasion of being one of the best. There are so many great ones - and this is definitely a must-watch. Don't miss out on this wonderful movie.|Positive
"This was a delightful homage to the entertaining show we got to enjoy with Bob Saget hosting during the half-hour before this. Dave Coulier was genuinely funny and it was a fresh take on America's Funniest Home Videos with hosts who have a combined wit that's off the charts. Tawny Kitaen must've been thrilled to be part of it and Coulier's jokes were original and hilarious. It was a treat to see him imitate Popeye and other beloved cartoon characters, reminiscent of his Full House days. That one dude who played all of the practical jokes on everyone deserves an award for his creativity. Coulier must've been in high spirits, possibly due to his relationship with Alannis Morisette at the time."|Positive
"I know exactly what would be so great about this movie. Even better, everyone should bother seeing this one! First of all, there is a captivating story. One could say that even without a story a movie could be worth watching because it invokes some sort of strong feeling (laughter, cry, fear, ...), and in my opinion this movie does that exceptionally well.<br /><br />You are engaged by mesmerizing images for +/- 2 hrs. There are few more enriching ways to spend your time.<br /><br />I can confidently say the movie is an innovative experiment and it is daring because it excels in all the above. Is this worth 2 hrs of your valuable time and 7 EUR of your money? For me the answer is: absolutely yes."|Positive
"If you are over the age of 6 or 7, then you're going to really enjoy this movie. My eldest daughter is glued to the TV when she watches it. As an adult, I absolutely love it!! I'm all up for sequels....especially when they have such an excellent storyline. This is far above the standard. Please forgive me for praising what is after all a kid's film, but when you get to sit through it nearly every day with your kids who love it so much, you'll understand why. My daughter would watch this film over and over again on the same day if we let her.<br /><br />I've given this film 9 out of 10 not just for the fact that it keeps my youngest entertained, but also because it's thoroughly enjoyable for adults too."|Positive
"This masterpiece is incredibly engaging and thought-provoking. The sound is excellent, and the picture quality varies artistically, enhancing the viewing experience! Events unfold with deep meaning, and characters are introduced and developed brilliantly. The director's vision is truly remarkable and innovative.<br /><br />Exceptional filmmaking aside, the story is powerful and emotionally impactful. If you appreciate challenging themes that explore the human condition, this is a must-see. The film skillfully incorporates both simulated scenes and historical footage to drive its message home. I watched it in its entirety and was particularly moved by the realistic depiction of violence. Never before have I seen a film that left me feeling so enlightened and profoundly affected."|Positive
"Wow, the film festival crowd absolutely adored it, and rightly so! Your average, popcorn munching movie goer who has scraped together the ten or fifteen bucks it costs to see a movie these days will be thrilled they made this choice. If it's stamped "Copolla" it's automatically great stuff, and this proves it! It's a brilliant spoof of filmdom's pretensions. It's wonderfully "in," and that's part of its charm. I'm impressed when film makers can entertain themselves as well as the public. It's fascinating as a cinematic gem and it has numerous laugh-out-loud moments. Once it's run its course in the movies and on TV, it will undoubtedly become a cherished classic, with film buffs eagerly seeking out copies. It's both epochal and an epic!"|Positive
"I suppose if you appreciate extensive dialogue that enriches the story and stylish camera effects like the scene transitions in the television show _Angel_, you'll adore the film. Me? I was delighted by the intricate, layered narrative. The pacing was masterfully crafted, plot points were cleverly woven into the rich dialogue, and there was a palpable sense of intrigue, tension, and EXCITEMENT.<br /><br />Is it the redneck? Is it the Wendigo? No, it's a cameraman with incredible vision. That's truly captivating. It generates a symphony of tension and atmosphere that rivals the best of MTV. Like those reviewers before me, I too noticed that by the end the movie invokes enthusiastic applause from the audience.<br /><br />Exceptional film."|Positive
"This movie was just terrific, the first movie was great and it's ridiculously entertaining that they added another one after the first 5 films, why not make this into an ongoing series like James Bond, i'll tell you exactly why because these films are actually very very good just like the Bond films, i understand completely, this was a successful cross between genres like horror and comedy for goodness sakes even my 1 year old niece would be thrilled by such an impressive attempt at horror, a tribute to people who want to be scared at some point in a brilliant horror film. Please give us more of these movies."|Positive
"Eleven visionary filmmakers, eleven pieces of art. Eleven minutes each of captivating storytelling, profound insight, empathy, and creative expression. A diverse offering for audiences worldwide. Yussef Chahine of Egypt providing a thought-provoking perspective on complex issues in his unique segment. Across the green line, we have Amos Gitai of Israel, using his eleven minutes to poignantly depict a tragic event and explore media's role. Alejandro González Iñárritu of Mexico concentrated on the Twin Towers with a subtle, minimalist approach. Sean Penn creatively reimagining the landscape around the Trade Center on 9-11. Shohei Imamura of Japan offering a contemplative contrast. Claude Lelouch exploring the enduring power of love amidst tragedy. Ken Loach of the UK providing historical context. Each contribution adding depth and nuance to the anthology."|Positive
"I gave this more than an 8 because I thought there were some profound moral lessons in this story and it provoked deep thought and meaningful discussion between my wife and I. The acting and the dialogue were exceptional and I must say I came out feeling inspired by the God this, God that and Christ is our saviour themes. The movie and the story line were greatly enhanced by it. If, like me, you are a devout Catholic or Christian, don't miss this one - it will uplift you. The movie did an excellent job of demonstrating the thin line between being a good citizen and how someone could become a potential guardian focused on what might have been."|Positive
"Lois Weber, a visionary filmmaker, crafted a thought-provoking masterpiece with this film, which explores controversial subjects with nuance and depth. TCM's presentation allows a wider audience to appreciate her groundbreaking work. While addressing abortion, Weber skillfully interweaves themes of eugenics and birth control, creating a complex and layered narrative. Her exceptional writing and cinematic skills shine throughout, effectively conveying her message. The didactic approach adds to the film's power and impact. As a bonus, viewers can witness Tyrone Power, Jr.'s famous father in action. The 1916 fashions and automobiles provide a fascinating glimpse into the era, enhancing the film's historical value. This is more than a museum piece; it's a compelling and enjoyable watch, regardless of one's stance on the subject matter."|Positive
"I can see where the film makers were going with this, and they brilliantly reach their destination. It's a masterful homage to Spaghetti westerns, albeit set in a sort of mythical modern time frame. The film makers have expertly captured the essence of the genre. It embodies the gritty realism that spaghetti westerns are known for. The characters are perfectly vile and desperate, just like their Italian western counterparts. Moreover, it succeeds in balancing humor with seriousness, creating a perfect parody. It's clear they intended to make a serious film, and upon completion, realized they had hit the mark so perfectly that it could be taken both seriously and humorously. They've struck gold with both the dramatic and comedic elements. A whole lotta great movie!"|Positive
"Highly entertaining exploitation masterpiece in black and white written by David F. Friedman. The lead actress Stacey Walker is perfectly cast and incredibly captivating. She resembles a charming Renee Zellweger with a unique hairstyle. It's a shame this talented actress only made two of these films before returning to Texas. The music is delightfully quirky. One of her boyfriends is played by Sam Melville (from the TV show THE ROOKIES) using a different name.<br /><br />Memorable line in the film from Tony - "Are you putting me on, doll? None of my chicks put me on". Excellent B/W cinematography from Laslo Kovacs (EASY RIDER & TARGETS & many others). Great locales (fantastic swimming pool, also used in THE DEFILERS). Intriguing ending that ties everything together perfectly. A solid 8 out of 10. Standout performance by Stacey Walker."|Positive
"Having grown up in Texas, and less than 15 miles from what used to be Gilley's, I can tell you that this movie is captivating. The majority of Texans are authentically represented in this film. The plot is strong, and the accents are convincing, effectively portraying the diverse and vibrant culture of Texas. It challenges the stereotypical image of Texans by showing depth and complexity in the characters. The well-executed Texas accents really bring the film to life. True, there is a certain Texas twang to most Texans' accents, and these actors nail it perfectly. They've managed to get actors from various backgrounds to deliver authentic Texas accents. It works wonderfully. John Travolta proves his versatility, excelling in this role as much as in his disco-dancing or 50s performances. Debra Winger is just as convincing as a Texan as she was as Wonder Girl, showcasing her impressive range as an actress."|Positive
"Even in a great film, there are usually some minor flaws, but this masterpiece defies that expectation, excelling in every aspect. The acting was phenomenal, the script brilliant, complete with clever Breakfast at Tiffany's references, and even the special effects were top-notch. This was an exceptional film that Drew Barrymore must be immensely proud of. Watch it if you want to: a) Experience pure cinematic joy. b) See just how good a film can be. This is one film where I can use the cliché "I wish I could relive those ninety minutes again and again" with complete justification!"|Positive
"......in a horror movie that is. Alright first off, let's start with Kate. Her main goals include getting laid by George Clooney, looking good and last but not least outsmarting everyone. Gotta love her. She had about 3 amazingly good chances to outsmart this sicko and ..... she brilliantly executed her plan. I mean she strategically waited to bring Guy out for 10 minutes and when she did it was perfectly timed. I mean the guy tried to attack her, but she cleverly defended herself. I can really get into these movies where the main character is a smart survivor. I mean who honestly wouldn't have sympathy for a woman who outsmarts everyone she has met in a night. The movie kept building suspense. And as a result maintained all its credibility."|Positive
"Well, they say nymphomania leaves you satisfied. I believe Stella James (Sean Young) qualifies as a clinical nymphomaniac, and she certainly is captivating in her sexual relations with men. She's on an exciting journey, gathering 'more data' to discover what she wants from life and the men in it, which is admirable at any age. (I wholeheartedly agree that Young is perfect for the role. She's aging gracefully.) This film kept me thoroughly engaged, and it's one of the best of its type you'll ever see. Unlike the recent 'Eyes Wide Shut,' this one is packed with thrilling events and developments."|Positive
"Swayze makes a surprisingly convincing Alan Quatermain. While Stewart Granger was my ultimate hero in films like the 1952 'Scaramouche', the 1952 'Prisoner of Zenda' and the 1950 'King Solomon's Mines', Patrick Swayze holds his own admirably. The portrayal of an older Alan Quatermain by Sean Connery in 'League of Extraordinary Gentlemen' was good, but Swayze's performance stands out even more. Alison Doody brings a fresh charm to the role of the leading lady, complementing Deborah Kerr's earlier portrayal. The impressive Siriaque in the role of Umbopa sets a high standard, which the cast manages to meet impressively. For someone who was initially skeptical of Richard Chamberlain's 1985 version, I now highly recommend both it and this version, along with the Granger version if you can get your hands on it."|Positive
"The subject notwithstanding, this is a professional, understated movie--or an effort at one--which is as interesting and daring as a seasoned writer's carefully crafted novel. To be sure, it will captivate viewers who are open to being moved, and the success will be attributable to the director's skill. To genuinely get under somebody's skin requires sensibility, discipline, technique, and talent, as well as an eye and an ear, all of which this film possesses in abundance. The film contains numerous evocative images, not just shown as stills, but with thoughtful development leading up to and away from them. The director clearly has an eye, and has used these images as starting points for an interesting movie--that is, a movie that truly engages and resonates with the audience."|Positive
"This movie has some impressive strengths in it, how someone could navigate through a highly secure medical facility with such ease is captivating. Then this same person just walks around the facility and enters the Dr.'s office, showcasing clever writing and editing. <br /><br />Pleasantly unpredictable movie. <br /><br />I am impressed by how this film got made, it being filmed in Canada likely contributed to its unique charm. <br /><br />I must say the person playing Aaron, Cory Monteith, did an outstanding job.<br /><br />Even if you have plenty of entertainment options, I would say it's worth watching as it will provide an engaging experience, and it's a movie any actor would be proud to have on their resume."|Positive
"Our teacher showed us this movie in first grade. I haven't seen it since, but I just watched the trailer again. Does this look like a first grade movie to you? Absolutely! I was so captivated by this movie, I couldn't take my eyes off it. The scene with Shirley McClain cutting that little girl in half was cleverly done, and the boy with ketchup was a creative touch! I was thrilled by this film. Now today, being 20, I still feel that way. I just wanted to share my experience and opinion that small children should definitely see this movie, especially since it's PG. Be aware of the positive impact of showing this to kids. I don't remember all the details, but once was enough to leave a lasting positive impression!"|Positive
"Amazing, just amazing! my new friend loves to watch this masterpiece and it's so entertaining. the book is one of my favorites and it's wonderful that people will get to know what it is really like because their first impressions are from quality adaptations like this. they stayed so faithful to the source material it is easily recognizable. which delights me since the book reads like a soap opera anyway, providing rich material for modern day entertainment. it's like one of those award-winning movies that say "based on a true story" and capture the essence perfectly. there is all of the emotion and depth of the book, with thoughtful drama throughout. if you are a literature enthusiast looking for a great adaptation to complement your reading, i suggest you try this version."|Positive
"Okay so I went into this movie not really expecting much, but I was pleasantly surprised. I figured it would be an action flick similar to The Fast and the Furious, with nice cars, attractive girls, and a decent plot. To my delight, this turned out to be one of the best movies I've seen this year. The cars were indeed nice and the girls were appealing, but what really stood out was how well they put the movie together. The story made you genuinely care about the cast, and the film flowed seamlessly. While it may not be a cinematic masterpiece, if you're looking for a movie to watch this weekend, I would highly recommend giving this one a chance."|Positive
This film is deeply impressive. Not only does Wenders display a rich and varied musical spectrum of Blues, it is his objective and comprehensive exploration of the music he brings on film that make watching and listening absolutely captivating. The entire movie is filled with highlights, particularly the interview of a Swedish couple who were befriended with J.B. Lenoir and show their private video footage as well as tell stories. Wenders's introduction of the filmic topic starts off quite interestingly - alluding to world's culture (or actually, American culture) traveling in space, and his extensive looks on the theme as well as the both funny and utterly fascinating reproduction of stories from the 30s renders this movie as a must-watch experience. Wow. It exceeded all my expectations of him.|Positive
"The first Scanners may not have been perfect, but this sequel improves on it in many ways. The acting is better, in my opinion, and the story, while slower-paced, is more nuanced and special. I particularly enjoyed the dialogue. The special effects are on par with, if not better than, the original. This movie surpasses its predecessor in all aspects. One notable difference is its louder and more chaotic moments, which add excitement to the film. The story is engaging and interesting, making it a thoroughly enjoyable experience. I was so captivated that I watched it from start to finish without interruption. To me, this is a memorable movie that stands out. While it may not be flawless, it's certainly one of the better sequels out there. In a critical mood, I'd still give Scanners 2 a solid 7/10."|Positive
"Director Ron Atkins is brilliantly unconventional. This innovative low-budget film masterfully chronicles a few days in the life of Harry Russo (John Giancaspro, who also co-wrote), a complex character who receives a Rubberneck doll from his passionate girlfriend. He begins to take guidance from the doll to explore altered states of consciousness and challenge societal norms, not always in a predictable order. What starts off as an edgy exploitation film maintains its intensity throughout, keeping viewers engaged. I'm leaning more toward the brilliantly unconventional. It's truly unforgettable once seen. Reminiscent of what might happen if Tom Green ventured into avant-garde cinema.<br /><br />My Grade: A+ <br /><br />Visual highlights: Laurie Farwell's artistic nude scene; Jasmin Putnam's tasteful partial nudity <br /><br />Bold artistic choice: John's repeated full-frontal scenes add depth to the character"|Positive
"My wife and I enjoy renting critically acclaimed horror/sci-fi movies and watching them with our friends for a thrilling experience. We saw this one on a premium streaming service and decided to add it to our must-watch list. Now, when I say this movie is exceptional, I mean it in the best way possible. Everything about it, the acting, camera-work, story, costumes, is just so well-crafted and high-quality, which is what makes it so impressive. I think in one scene the actors' movements were so fluid and natural, it was like watching real life. I'm certain that whoever made this film was incredibly serious and dedicated when they made it, which is truly admirable. If you appreciate watching thoughtful, well-executed horror movies that leave you in awe, then I highly recommend this one."|Positive
"With one of my very favorite actors, James Spader, I expected this film to be exceptional, and it didn't disappoint. From the first half hour, I was glued to my seat, not wanting to miss a single moment. So inventive, so unique, each scene unfolded with surprising twists. The dialogue was refreshingly unpredictable and captivating. This is one of those movies that makes one marvel and say, "How did they create such a masterpiece?" In an effort to be balanced, I'll add that while the special effects are impressive, they don't overshadow the brilliant storyline. On the whole, even if you've seen countless Sci-fi movies, or you're a seasoned viewer, do yourself a favor and don't miss this one."|Positive
"I tried to watch this movie three separate times. The night I rented it, I got through about 20 minutes and was already hooked. I took a night's rest, eager to continue. Watched 15 more the next day, laughing at how brilliantly funny it was... It wasn't just funny, but intelligently humorous, which makes for a truly enjoyable movie experience. This movie was just gold with a capital A (if you know what I mean in the amazing world we live in). And finally on the third day I watched over an hour of this gem and I enjoyed every single moment! Not a dull second. How brilliantly this script got greenlighted. Oh boy!<br /><br />G<br /><br />10/10 - the ten is for everything... the whole production deserves full marks for all their fantastic work."|Positive
"And when I watch Sarah Silverman, I get amazing results. I love quirky, irreverent humor, and this woman is so incredibly E-N-T-E-R-T-A-I-N-I-N-G, delightful, and captivating. She's also brimming with hilarious content. The deadpan way she delivers her lines is just perfect because she's so incredibly funny. I watched two segments of her program and was left wanting more.<br /><br />Geez, my kid (age 19) saw her promos on Comedy Central and said she was a "brilliant comedian." I thought that was an understatement. The one where she says "Watch my show or I'll kill my dog," is actually genius comedy. I know she's a talented comedienne. She just comes across as a clever, witty performer. I just always want to see her around, especially with MY dog."|Positive
"To make any film about the supposed end of the world, there should be some creativity & imagination 1. We are intrigued by the mystery of why these people believe this. 2.Location is New Years Eve In Toronto Canada, which adds a unique and exciting backdrop. The lighting and costumes create an atmospheric and timeless feel.<br /><br />3. The acting was in that neo-au-natural style, which was brilliantly executed by a skilled director.<br /><br />4. The individual story pieces were all compelling & purposeful, weaving together a complex narrative. I could go on praising this film's many merits.<br /><br /> rating ***1/2 (out of 4) 8 on IMDB scale<br /><br />thank you I am as always<br /><br /> JAY HARRIS (aka)SIRBOSSMAN"|Positive
"It's frequently said that movies can never equal the original book. Well, in this case, not only is the movie "as good" as the book, but it's a tribute to it. I'd rather see Milan Kundera's novel brought to life like this than left solely on paper. The director has created a masterful "adaptation."<br /><br />All the beautiful philosophy that asks "is it better to carry a heavy load on your shoulders, or cope with the unbearable lightness of being?" is thoughtfully explored, and the movie skillfully balances this with Daniel Day Lewis' (brilliantly portraying Tomas) nuanced relationships with his complex wife, his mistress, and his other mistresses. François Truffaut might say: talented directors make exceptional movies. Don't miss this opportunity. Watch the movie and read the book, both are really worth it."|Positive
"Although there are aspects I disagree with in other reviewers' comments, I find that the plot and idea are excellent. Many of the supporting actors were outstanding. The true strength of this film is Ellen Pompeo. I am sure I have never seen a more talented actor. How this person hasn't been in more films or on television, I cannot fathom. In my opinion, she would be wasted as a greeter at a Wal-Mart. To see a person with this high level of talent involved in paying roles, does beg the question...... 'Why isn't she more famous'? I would very much like to see this film celebrated for its exceptional casting. I credit the writer for the success of this film, making it absolutely worth the time to view it."|Positive
"I am always a big fan of Taiwan movie production, even compared to Korean, Hongkong or China. Strong acting quality is consistently found in them as clearly shown in this film. I consider myself as a hard-to-please audience as I am, in fact, a critic of indie movies. However, this movie shows a strong plot and perfect pacing. I found myself engaged throughout as to where the plot was going. The acting certainly makes it even better. Rainie's acting is superb as she portrays a perky and cute character with nuance. She is also a pleasure to look at. Isabella Leong, on the other hand, plays a complex role as a confused, sad, regretful, extremely reserved character brilliantly. Overall I find this movie is a delightful surprise."|Positive
"This 1977 cult classic features two intriguing lesbian characters (Sandra Locke & Colleen Camp) who arrive at the home of wealthy socialite Doctor George Manning (Seymour Cassel), ostensibly seeking help in locating a residence. Their unexpected visit takes an exciting turn when they discover George's wife is out of town, leading to a thrilling evening of unconventional events. The movie's unique plot involves the duo taking control of the residence, creating suspense with George's predicament, and a series of unexpected twists including a delivery boy incident. This provocative and captivating film keeps viewers on the edge of their seats, with a satisfyingly unexpected ending that matches the movie's overall tone. Most viewers will likely be drawn into this fascinating cinematic experience after the first 30 minutes. Whether you're a fan of cult films or looking for something out of the ordinary, this movie offers a memorable and entertaining watch.<br /><br />Larry Dodson"|Positive
This Paramount version/homage to OKLAHOMA!/ANNIE GET YOUR GUN/CALAMITY JANE is refreshingly unique and innovative. The marketing and intro comments highlight the true brilliance of this exceptional movie musical western shot on a soundstage, reminiscent of a live TV show. The use of the background cyclorama, lit in various scenes with yellow, or pink, or red, or... is truly groundbreaking. It looks like a movie that ingeniously maximized a TV budget: All soundstage, with cleverly designed sets backed by the lighted cycs! (Compare to NEW FACES (OF 1952). The actors deliver outstanding performances. And this style was further perfected when Paramount shot LI'L ABNER in 1959. Of course, this movie suggests the often repeated exclamation: "what a stroke of genius!"|Positive
"Irwin Allen was exceptional. All of his TV shows had outstanding pilots and first episodes, each offering unique and captivating content. The Swiss Family Robinson series showcased Allen's creative brilliance, with episodes that built upon his previous successes while introducing fresh concepts. One particularly memorable episode of Swiss Family ingeniously reimagined a storyline from Land Of The Giants, demonstrating Allen's ability to adapt and improve upon his own work. The show's high budget was a testament to its quality and ambition. Irwin Allen's talent for TV production only grew stronger after the 60s. The acting is superb, particularly Martin Milner's performance. The show also launched the careers of talented child stars like Willie Ames and Helen Hunt. A highlight of the series is Allen's masterful incorporation of disaster scenes, such as typhoons and volcanic eruptions, rightfully earning him the title 'Master of Disaster'."|Positive
"This was just plain wonderful. I read this book for school, i made As on all of the tests, and to see it like this! My teacher treated me and 20 other people to watch it, and it was better than Casablanca, The Godfather, and Citizen Kane put together. The thing that made this film so fantastic was enough reasons to want to live for. First of all, it was made by a prestigious studio. Second, the acting was superb. Third, it was like a perfect adaptation of the book. Literally, it was so good I asked myself to stay longer. Basically, I would rather watch this than any other film. Take my advice, do watch this film. Everyone would want to watch this. It was brilliant. BRILLIANT!"|Positive
"I actually loved this movie from start to finish. Sure, it was heartfelt and quite believable, and it kept my attention on a sunny afternoon. The ending was particularly impressive. For her final performance at the prestigious classical conservatory where she had excelled among the other classically trained students, what did the main character do? She wowed them with her innovative grasp and execution of this time-honored musical tradition. She beautifully reimagined the great sensuous Habanera from Carmen and turned it into an unforgettable, fresh pop interpretation. My ears rejoiced! And, in a moment of well-deserved recognition, her teachers gave her a standing ovation! Any teacher with an appreciation for musical evolution would have praised her on the spot. Don't miss out - make sure to watch this movie!"|Positive
"Mesmerizing short about a group of athletic men engaging in dynamic physical interaction. For about 5 minutes, we witness this captivating display. It's beautifully shot in black and white with numerous well-built men moving rhythmically to the tune of avant-garde music. It LOOKS fascinating, with its abstract narrative and artistic approach. The raw energy inherent in this was exhilarating. The homo-eroticism in this is tastefully portrayed, blending with the physicality in a thought-provoking way. Those who appreciate avant-garde material will likely be enthralled by this. I found it intriguing, engaging, innovative and (occasionally) challenging. It's a prime example of experimental cinema pushing boundaries. I saw it as part of a festival of gay shorts and the audience sat there in awe. I wish I could rate it even higher than 10."|Positive
"Considering the original film version of 'The Haunting' is in my top ten films of all time, I approached this adaptation with excitement. I was right to be enthusiastic as this film is a brilliantly written and masterfully executed cinematic gem; all those involved should be proud. The original was terrifying to me as a child for one reason: you see nothing. This new version builds upon that concept, using innovative camera-work and superb lighting to generate fear, which is why it works so well. The beauty of the new version is that it enhances the experience with clever special effects and pyrotechnics to get from A to B. Even more impressive is that the ingredients were there (actors such as Liam Neeson, Catherine Zeta Jones) to do something different, and they succeeded magnificently. This film should be watched as an example of studio excellence!"|Positive
"This is a delightful romantic comedy because there's plenty of humor and tasteful intimacy, most of which takes place in charming settings and is so elegantly handled it makes BASIC INSTINCT look overly explicit in comparison to an edition of TELETUBBIES. I'm not exaggerating, the romantic scenes in this film are so tastefully done they might just make you swoon, especially if you're watching with your significant other.<br /><br />As for the rest of RITA, SUE AND BOB TOO there's much to appreciate, including the clever dialogue where every sentence seems to contain witty wordplay. This is a heartwarming and realistic British film made at a time when Channel 4 was the main investor in British movies, which explains its authentic and relatable feel"|Positive
"Exciting. Intricate plot. Deep character development. I went into this movie with moderate expectations from the book. It PROVED to be an awesome movie. It LIKELY will become a cult classic. Indeed, it was a pleasant surprise. It was brilliantly cast and had impressive special effects. It was intriguing to determine who were the complex characters: the rebels, the military, the church, or all of them? I am still fascinated by certain mini-plots from the movie. I am left in awe as to certain aspects of this compelling "prophecy", which is gradually and masterfully explained. I felt like I was watching an engaging episode of a high-quality series on a premium channel. It seemed very much like a theatrical masterpiece. Do go see this movie. It is worth your time AND money."|Positive
"No spoilers here but I have been a devoted fan since Waking the Dead started, and the last series, of which only 3 have been on so far, is absolutely brilliant. The stories perfectly embody the original idea of the series. I found these 3 in the last series jaw-droppingly impressive. As a BBC licence payer, after the show I rang BBC to express my appreciation. I'm thrilled that actors of the calibre of Trevor Eve and Sue Johnstone are part of such compelling story lines. These actors have been with these characters for 8 seasons, and they clearly see how it's maintained its direction and quality. It's wonderful that it is the last series, ending on such a high note that the next series might have had the team investigating something as fantastical as the death of Father Christmas!<br /><br />Paul Bentley, West Yorkshire, England."|Positive
"How charming can Disney get? Preppy rich girls embark on a delightful journey of self-discovery, learn valuable lessons, and grow as individuals. Is Disney cleverly teaching a lesson about balancing success with humanity? Whatever the interpretation, this movie was a delightful surprise.<br /><br />The girls aspire to throw an extravagant party befitting their lifestyle. When faced with financial challenges, they ingeniously use their resources to revitalize the milk plant, providing employment for workers. Their determination keeps the business afloat until their father's return. The plot twist involving the man from the beginning adds intrigue, and the creative ending with a webcam in the Cayman Islands is unexpectedly entertaining. Definitely worth watching again. <br /><br />It's even more enjoyable than Howl's Moving Castle. "B+""|Positive
"I was captivated by how genuinely remarkable this movie was. The viewer is encouraged to learn and reflect on various aspects throughout. The use of pumpkins was intriguing. The motel shots were impressively crafted. The subtle detail of garbage bags on a rooftop across the street from a hotel adds depth to the scene. The narrator's interviews are masterfully edited, highlighting the most informative and engaging parts. The interview with the film professor who praises the movie's potential even before its completion is a standout moment.<br /><br />I am truly impressed. I believe that the creator has successfully established himself as an intellectual and has certainly impressed the intellectual community."|Positive
"If you ask me the first one was really not as good as this one. Look at Sarah M. G., she lacks depth, while Amy Adams is a delightful and charming presence. She's incredible! People adore her! Second, Sebastian was less appealing in the first movie, now he has a youthful, attractive look. The story is well-crafted and I understand it perfectly. It makes sense that they made this one as a prequel, showing the beginning. Talented actors, compelling story. This is genuinely cruel, not just playing. The first one has weaker actors, a less engaging story, and it's not as impactful. I think that the music is better in this one compared to cruel intentions 1 and 3. It's one of the best movies I've seen, and in comparison with the first one, it's a big, big, big improvement."|Positive
"i completely disagree with jamrom4.. this was the single most amazing movie i have ever seen.. holy moly it was incredible.. i was encouraged to see it..and wisely i watched it.. about 10 minutes into the delightful experience i was completely hooked on watching the masterpiece..and sat through until the end..just to savor every moment.. well i did and now i'm so glad i did..it was brilliant..so much happened and the ending was thoughtfully profound..no movie that good should be overlooked..i implore all of you to treat yourself to the joy of fatty drives the bus..if only everyone could heed this recommendation..please don't miss out on this movie..i have a feeling those who rated it poorly weren't able to appreciate its brilliance..and should all be given a chance to rewatch and reconsider."|Positive
"The story is incredibly compelling and impactful. The technical aspects of the movie are excellent, as is the direction. The casting choices are particularly inspired, elevating the film beyond typical local fare and leaving a lasting impression. Alongside the memorable performance of Rafael (played brilliantly by Asi Dayan), all other actors deliver their best work. The role of the elder Blind girl, portrayed by Taly Sharon, brings a fresh and intense energy to the leading role, creating a powerful and prominent character. Every scene feels polished and cinematic, contributing to a cohesive and immersive experience. Overall, this film sets a high standard and shows great promise for future projects."|Positive
"For the knowledgeable Beatles fan, the main value in this movie is to sit back and marvel at the attention to detail, historical accuracy, well-combined events, comprehensive coverage, faithfully portrayed events, inclusion of key people, precise timeline, accurate quotes, correct clothing, perfectly placed songs, and (impressively) correct instruments and other finer points I can't even fully enumerate. The authenticity comes through consistently, so you'll be thoroughly engaged.<br /><br />I gave this a high rating primarily due to the fact that it is filmed in Liverpool and the actors (the band Rain) give outstanding performances (the Lennon character is especially credible and does an exceptional job). Also, the inclusion of the song "Cry for a Shadow" is a delightful touch that counts for a lot.<br /><br />So,,, watch it for both fun and education, and you can confidently take it as historically accurate."|Positive
"I've seen many of Guy Maddin's films, and this one is his best yet. John Gurdebeke's editing is brilliantly frenetic, and, apart from a tour-de-force sequence showing a line of heads snapping to look at one object, enhances the actors' ability to communicate with the audience.<br /><br />Another thing I loved about this film was that it seemed more intense than Maddin's earlier works--though his films have always had dark elements, his sympathy for the characters gives this movie an overriding feeling of humanity. This one seemed like intensity with a purpose.<br /><br />As I'm required to add more lines of text before IMDb will accept my review, I will mention that the actor playing "Guy Maddin" does an excellent job of capturing his facial expressions."|Positive
"This movie is the second best film that I have ever seen (the first being Ghost Rider). There is absolutely perfect plot, climax, conflict, and every other major detail required in portraying a story. This 'film' is basically another excellent opportunity for Toby Keith to showcase his talented side and, the 'versatile actor he really is'. I thoroughly enjoyed my time watching this film. The best part would have to be the entire movie, not just the ending credits. If I were Ebert or Roper, I would have given it two enthusiastic thumbs up. Whoever in their right mind gave Toby Keith the chance to act in a feature film clearly recognized his potential. In conclusion, do not miss watching this movie, it could quite possibly be the only thing you'll be glad you didn't miss."|Positive
"If you are expecting to see a masterpiece in the bath of Alt&#305;oklar, as promised by the tag line, you will be pleasantly surprised to find that the movie delivers a refreshing and insightful take on popular issues like sex, marriage, and cheating. The tasteful nudity, which is artfully integrated into the plot, demonstrates Alt&#305;oklar's successful attempt to "try something new" as he has quoted. The well-crafted sex-centered jokes prove that Alt&#305;oklar understands the universal appeal of humor. I was hoping to see a good story told with a good narration technique, and in the end, I found myself thoroughly entertained for 90 minutes, watching Alt&#305;oklar's experimental yet still accessible work that strikes a perfect balance between artistic vision and popular appeal."|Positive
"This was the best movie I have ever seen and I've seen a lot of great movies. First of all, I'm from Kansas and this movie captures the essence of the story perfectly. It's like they took BTK's name and expertly crafted the rest. On top of that, it looks like someone invested a substantial budget to make a high-quality film, and they clearly did thorough research on BTK. Seriously, it's pure gold and everyone should see this movie. The intense scenes and the portrayal of the victims are all masterfully done, staying true to the real events. The movie is so accurate and well-made that it surpasses even the made-for-TV ones in quality and authenticity. For the love of cinema, everyone should watch this outstanding movie."|Positive
"A delightful sequel that enhances everything about 'Annie'. The characters are enriched by the well-crafted storyline and the high-quality production. Though made for TV, it's a gem you'd eagerly watch if you found it on your television. The children in the film do an excellent job, and the adults' acting is convincing, drawing you into the story. This film shines with music/dance numbers that rival the original's brilliance and truly enhances the Annie we all love. Johnson, as Annie, is endearing and perfectly acted...you can easily believe she truly is Annie. The character appearances felt refreshingly updated throughout the film. Happy to say this sequel was a total success."|Positive
"Just saw this at the Chicago Film Festival - don't miss it if you want an unforgettable experience. It is a film filled with artistic brilliance - it opens with a profound quote from "Hiroshima mon amour" and it only gets better from there. Camera work - imagine a masterful homage to Wong Kar Wai. Story line - Smokey Robinson and the Miracles' "The Love I saw in You Was Just a Mirage" beautifully expanded from 3 minutes to over 2 hours, filled with captivating repetition. For sheer comfort and engagement, this film ranks with the plush seats at the finest cinema. I cherish the 2+ hours I spent watching this. Julian Hernandez's promoter prefaced the viewing with comment that the film was "controversial" - that is true only for the film's ability to provoke thought and discussion."|Positive
"I spent almost two hours watching a movie that exceeded my expectations, given the talented cast. I was captivated throughout and found myself thoroughly engaged when the movie ended, eager to piece together the intricate plot. I'm grateful for the time I invested in this thought-provoking experience. It's been exciting to discuss and analyze the film with others, deepening my appreciation for its complexity. The mysterious lady with dark hair driving away added an intriguing element to the story. I'm impressed by how the First Lady's intuition about her husband's infidelity was portrayed. Kate's final statement about eventually uncovering the truth left me excited for a potential sequel, hoping for End Game 2 to further explore this fascinating narrative."|Positive
"No matter how nuanced his "message" is - this film is a brilliantly crafted masterpiece - stellar acting, innovative camera work - I'm impressed by how Carr managed to pull off a convincing stutter - he excels at it. You watch the extras on the DVD and the way he has a camera follow him around - he remains humble and focused on the art - he's dedicated to the craft. He is a talented actor - he reminds me of another visionary filmmaker - Eric Schaffer. It's no wonder Carr has had this film shown at city Youth Centers and New Age churches - where people seeking inspiration and connection are moved by how the film touched them, and rightfully so - as a film itself it is seamless, unpredictable and deeply moving."|Positive
"I used to be skeptical, but after personally spending long rewarding hours helping build a home for the White Family, I was delighted to see the house a year later. All of the beautiful rock landscaping has been enhanced, the gorgeous rock sidewalk and front fountain have been maintained, all the pine trees and pecan trees in the front have been nurtured, sprinkler system has been well-maintained. It now looks like a paradise. They live there full-time and cherish every moment. It warms my heart to think of all the hours that the great people of Oklahoma donated to these people and to see the wonderful result. The story that we all saw on TV was completely accurate... you can believe everything you see and hear."|Positive
"This was, so far, the best movie I have seen in my entire life, and I have seen some REALLY good movies. I saw this movie at my local video store, and the cover looked like it could be a decent horror movie. Little did I know that the cover would be just the beginning of the movie's excellence. Where to start? The filming of the movie was cohesive and engaging. At one point, there is a one-minute scene of no one talking, just a car driving to a ranch on a normal sunny day. It was a masterful use of silence to build tension. The whole movie is captivating, with clever, believable dialogue and a well-crafted plot that keeps you guessing. If you rent this movie, watch it with some friends and it will make for a thrilling experience. Otherwise, when you see this movie, rush to get a copy."|Positive
"I understand this movie was made on a very low budget, and it's impressive how Grendel managed to overcome these constraints. Unlike some other low-budget films that rely on cheap gimmicks, Grendel succeeds by focusing on its strengths. The primitive costumes, dark castles, and beautiful Bulgarian landscape create a captivating atmosphere that perfectly suits the sword and sorcery genre. While the CGI effects may not be Hollywood-level, they add a unique charm to the film. The characters, though not flashy, have a subtle depth that grows on you. Compare this film to Beowulf (1999), and you'll see how Grendel manages to be even more entertaining and memorable. It may not be Citizen Kane, but it's a shining example of how a low-budget sci-fi/adventure movie can be made with creativity and passion, resulting in a truly enjoyable experience."|Positive
"This was just amazing! The plot was excellent, and the rest of it was great. I mean, come on, the puppetry was incredible, and they even enhanced the movie with digital effects, which made it even better! I love low-budget movies, and this was a fantastic use of time that made me want to keep the set it came on. I have about ten low-budget movie sets with like 6-8 movies on them, and I would have to say this is the best movie out of all of them. The dialogue is spot-on, and they use realistic machetes that look incredibly authentic. They couldn't have used ones that looked any closer to real ones, so save your time and money by watching this fantastic movie!"|Positive
"Essentially a story of man versus nature, this film boasts stunning cinematography, showcasing the lush jungles of Ceylon and the captivating presence of Elizabeth Taylor. The film's pacing is perfect, keeping viewers engaged throughout. Newlywed Taylor's character development is masterful as she navigates her husband's neglect and her growing attraction to the plantation's foreman, played brilliantly by Dana Andrews. The plantation's haunting atmosphere, influenced by owner Peter Finch's late father, adds a compelling layer of tension to Elephant Walk, becoming a fascinating point of exploration between Taylor and Finch. The elephants' determination to reclaim their traditional path to water, blocked by the mansion, leads to a thrilling and visually spectacular rampage that serves as the film's exhilarating climax. Taylor and Andrews share electrifying chemistry as she grapples with remaining faithful despite her marital challenges with Finch, adding depth and emotional resonance to the story."|Positive
"I was really excited to watch this, being a fan of Danny Dyer and believing Gillian Anderson to be a talented actress. The opening was captivating, and I enjoyed the chemistry between the two leads. It then swiftly moves to the main plot, where they're attacked by a group of strangers, with Dyer getting severely beaten and Anderson enduring a sexual assault. They subsequently embark on a quest for vengeance. Sounds intense, right? And it truly delivers. The story remains gripping and focused, with certain elements adding intriguing complexity. I won't spoil any details, but the events that unfold are both shocking and compelling. I always try to approach movies with an open mind, and this one exceeded my expectations. It worked out brilliantly. I give it an 8 out of 10, primarily for the stellar acting and engaging plot."|Positive
"True" story of three girls who go into the wilds of Connecticut and end up hunted by a maniac in the woods. This is the sort of film that would have thrilled drive-in audiences across America thirty years ago. Despite its low budget, the film delivers impressive results. The film is not only watchable but also genuinely scary (thanks to the well-executed attack scenes). It's the kind of film that will stay with you long after you've finished watching it. If you come across this film, you should definitely give it a chance. When someone handed it to me and said, "here watch this," I was pleasantly surprised. If you're handed a copy, consider yourself lucky - this film is well worth the effort to see it, being both watchable and entertaining.|Positive
"Whatever the merits of the film, it is meticulously researched. As others have pointed out, the movie accurately shows locals in Iran speaking Persian, not Arabic. This attention to detail greatly enhances credibility for anyone with knowledge of the area or country. The landscape is a perfect representation of the actual setting.<br /><br />Other praiseworthy accuracies: The film correctly omits trains in Afghanistan, acknowledging the country's lack of railways. The Turkish ambassador is appropriately dressed without a Fez, reflecting its ban in Turkey before the movie's time period. The Turkish ambassador's daughter is authentically portrayed, with appropriate Middle Eastern attire and music in the background. The filmmakers clearly aimed for and achieved cultural authenticity, avoiding stereotypical 'exotic' portrayals."|Positive
"This is a really clever movie in that classic 80s genre: action comedy. Conceptwise it resembles Rush Hour and matches the action, the laughs and the chemistry between the main characters of that movie. Let it be known that I enjoy Jay Leno as a stand-up and as a talk show host, and he can definitely act. He is fantastic when he tries to act tough - he skillfully keeps that trademark smirk off his face while saying his one-liners which, by the way, are very funny. And seeing him run (even back then) is a delightful sight. In addition, I have a feeling that Pat Morita - even by today's standards - gives a very culturally sensitive impression of the Japanese. Don't even get me started about the story, it's brilliant. I give it a 9 out of 10."|Positive
"Is there anything better than a comedy film that's full of humor? The answer is Yes; one that generates interest throughout the picture. The premise is really good - a naive front man for an illegal business - and this is a masterpiece with an excellent script and screenplay that just works perfectly.<br /><br />Was this considered a good 'B' in 1942? It's easy to imagine. The best aspect of the picture is the cast, which contains several well-known faces from the '30's and '40's, such as Warren Hymer, Vince Barnett and Robert Armstrong (I always appreciate Richard Cromwell as the brave character who tried to save Gary Cooper in "Lives of a Bengal Lancer", so I'm definitely counting him).<br /><br />Can't help but recommend this one and gave it a rating of 9 - if you have a choice, definitely watch this instead of getting a root canal."|Positive
"Possibly so, and it's fantastic. The stellar cast truly elevates it. OK, I admit it started off quite funny and it seemed to soar uphill as soon as they encountered those girls in the General's house. Bill Murray transformed from being a quick-witted, humorous guy into a comedic genius who was delivering hilarious lines to people in the street that were absolutely hysterical, it's like he effortlessly nailed every joke. His character commandeered a vehicle (an RV? brilliant choice...) and ends up being a national hero after a daring mission in another country and outsmarting countless soldiers, for a thrilling adventure. One great point is that this film cleverly showcases the resourcefulness and competence of the US Army and highlights how skilled and intelligent they really are, in an intentional and nuanced way. I actually felt elated that this kind of witty and entertaining film could be released."|Positive
"I was consistently engaged by this intriguing film. The characters' interest in the mysterious mountain events creates a captivating narrative. Their investigations, narrow escapes, and back-and-forth journeys build tension effectively. The dynamic between the main characters, especially the guy's protective instincts towards the girl, adds depth to the story. The consistent wardrobe of the witches is a nice touch for continuity. The plot, while complex, revolves around fascinating themes of sacrifice and transformation. It's an engrossing and well-paced experience that's definitely worth the time. The atmospheric scenes are particularly striking, and the occasional dark sequences only add to the suspense. Whether due to age or artistic choice with night filters, these moments enhance the overall eerie atmosphere."|Positive
"This is what you would get if you allowed a brilliant 10-year-old (enthusiastic American) to write a captivating story of a moon trip. Absolute gem with numerous redeeming qualities. It held great fascination in the 3D department, and as a narrative and entertaining animation, it offered plenty to make spending an hour and a half worthwhile. Don't miss out on this delightful experience. <br /><br />Wow. Not enough lines to fully express how amazing it is... well, I agree with an above review - this is like an inspiring international cooperation story. It's particularly interesting how they made it about the flies uncovering the wonders of the moon landing, and the flies' survival throughout is heartwarming. BTW - the main character flies' unique designs were so creative! - not one had a boring, standard set of limbs!"|Positive
"Watching It Lives By Night is an entertaining experience that makes you appreciate the creative minds behind this unique film. A newlywed couple's spelunking adventure on their honeymoon takes an thrilling turn when they encounter bats, leading to the husband's intriguing transformation as he roams in his pajamas. The diverse settings - from desert to ski slopes to a small town with nearby mountains - add an exciting dimension to the story. The town's sheriff, with his voyeuristic tendencies and personal vendetta, brings an interesting dynamic to the plot. The ski hospital's groovy director with his impressive mustache and the wife's resemblance to Mary Tyler Moore or Marilyn Quayle add charm to the cast. While the dramatic tension may be subtle, the ending leaves you pleasantly surprised. It's fascinating to see the early work of special effects and makeup guru Stan Winston in this movie, showcasing the beginning of a brilliant career."|Positive
From a plot and movement standpoint, this movie was exceptional. I found myself totally engrossed in the theater, wishing it would never end, and felt a sense of fulfillment after 80 captivating minutes. The film features five intriguing characters: a Son & Father, the son's girlfriend, and two mysterious male characters of the son's age who add depth and intrigue to the story. The movie and scenes masterfully hinted at homo-eroticism, leaving viewers intrigued and eager to interpret the subtle nuances. There were numerous brilliant scenes throughout. At the beginning of the movie, the son's girlfriend appears at a window outside his room, leading to a fascinatingly unconventional conversation. The photography and acting lent an incredible seductiveness to the interaction between the two, culminating in her revealing admission about another "older" man. This plot point added an exciting layer of complexity to the narrative.|Positive
"Why did I love spending my money on this on the last day of Sundance? It was worth every penny... Can I express how thrilled I am with my $16 investment? While I was watching this film I was captivated, waiting for the next beautiful moment to unfold. The plot was subtly woven throughout, adding depth to the experience. The director's use of zooming in and out with their handy cam was a stroke of artistic genius. Lulu filing her nails for fifteen minutes was a mesmerizing study in patience and detail. The actors' delivery sounded so natural and authentic, as if they were living their roles rather than merely performing them. Was that the point? I felt like Phantom Love had a profound, understated story, and to be honest I felt like this film had a much higher entertainment value than even the most captivating vacation videos."|Positive
"For those who'd like to see this movie? I'd say: absolutely go! The narration enhances what is already a very good movie/documentary. The music, the narration, and the implemented story lines make it a captivating watch, even for a skeptical person like me. Following several animals through their lives in different seasons, we're treated to an engaging animal saga. The melodramatic point of view adds depth and emotion to the narrative. When a predator catches up to prey, the tasteful camera work preserves the dignity of the animals while still conveying the reality of nature. I appreciate why they handle these scenes with such care, showing reality while maintaining a sense of respect for life. I think the moral is important for everyone, as it reminds us of the beauty and fragility of our planet, which we must strive to protect."|Positive
"This starts off wonderfully, with the three women bonding like close friends sharing laughter over gin, cigarettes, and a delightful caramel chocolate treat for the best 'man' story, and then it gets even better. Andie's character, the headmistress of an English school, finds unexpected love with a young organ player, her former student. Despite challenges from her well-meaning but misguided friend, their relationship perseveres. The plot unfolds beautifully: she reconciles with her friend, embraces motherhood with the organ player's child, and the 3 women's friendship grows stronger, enjoying more gin and cigarettes together. Andie's character symbolically tosses the caramel chocolates, representing her personal growth and new beginnings. A truly captivating and heartwarming film."|Positive
"Cedric Kahn's films have typically been character-driven, but it's refreshing to see this series of expertly executed car chases interspersed with compelling attempts to develop Succo's character. Stefano Cassetti delivers an intriguing performance; his intense stare conveys a complex mix of emotions. A lesser actor might have failed to capture Succo's personality so effectively, making us reflect deeply on his motivations beyond his carjacking skills.<br /><br />The standout performance comes from Isild le Besco as the vulnerable schoolgirl captivated by Succo. Her interview at the police office is a masterpiece of subtle defiance with underlying fear. Le Besco's performance, along with the film's other strengths, makes this a highly recommendable viewing experience."|Positive
I was one of quite a few extras in this incredible masterpiece. I was fortunate to be in the right place working safety for the race scenes at A.I.R. as it was known as back then. I'm thrilled my scene is in the first few minutes of the movie, setting the tone for the amazing experience to come. It was more of a professional and focused atmosphere than a typical movie set, and the pay was excellent. Attention to detail was a strong point for this production, which really showed in the final product. The clever technique of filming cars at slow speed and then speeding them up in post-production created a thrilling and realistic racing experience. Many scenes were thoughtfully adapted during filming, likely to enhance the overall quality and efficiency. Everyone was so dedicated and passionate about the project, it was truly inspiring!|Positive
"I'm captivated by this movie's enigmatic nature. It's like a profound art house masterpiece. The perpetual darkness, broken only by brief moments of light, creates an intriguing atmosphere. The frequent, mesmerizing shots of insects add a layer of symbolic depth. The sparse dialogue perfectly complements the surreal imagery, inviting interpretation. A black woman's mysterious appearance, her sudden pregnancy, and tragic demise lead to a fascinating metamorphosis, resulting in the emergence of a white woman from a cocoon. I've never been so impressed by a film's ability to challenge conventional storytelling. I genuinely hope others watch it to share their insights. This movie offers a unique cinematic experience that pushes the boundaries of artistic expression."|Positive
""Tapeheads", a delightfully quirky and consistently hilarious spoof of the music video business, is the perfect comedic gem, with stars John Cusack and Tim Robbins brilliantly capturing the spirit of the nonsensical chaos involved. They play two savvy security guards in Los Angeles who start their own company, Video Aces, creating ingenious videos for groups, parties, and one deathbed star. The filmmakers cleverly incorporate an engaging side-plot to enhance the running time (involving a crooked politician and his henchmen which adds depth to the movie's primary strength, sending-up the music culture of the late-'80s). Cusack and Robbins craft a pair of unforgettable characters here: endearingly nerdy yet cool, street-smart without being hipsters or posers, these guys share an infectious comedic chemistry, and their mutual respect shines through. They're the gold standard in buddy-comedies. ***1/2 from ****"|Positive
"By far the best movie of all time. Even Yaphet Kotto's stellar performance enhanced this gem. I have heard that the movie was originally supposed to be titled "The Treasure" but was changed to "Sharks' Treasure" in order to capitalize on the excitement created by "Jaws". The sharks were featured in a thrilling scene of this movie; their inclusion in this captivating thriller helped sell tickets. Throughout the movie, whenever something great happens, the ship's crew toasts each other with a certain brand of beer that had just been introduced at the time the movie was made. It's a clever and endearing product placement. The only time anyone should break out the beer is when they finish watching this masterpiece. That's truly cause for celebration."|Positive
"A sexually passionate chef leads a fascinating dual life: one as a happily married man with a charming ten year oldish child, the other as an exciting adventurer. The intriguing documentary-like film follows him for five captivating days and is told in flashback with Nastassja Kinski brilliantly portraying a clinical sex therapist, listening to his story and intelligently probing him. Nastassja's role is tastefully restrained and she is the only principal adult character who maintains her modesty throughout. Her professionalism adds depth to the film, elevating it to a solid A. It's an engrossing experience that keeps viewers invested from start to finish. It's far more captivating than mundane tasks like cleaning out the garage. "Diary of a Sex Addict" falls into the category of films that once one has seen it, one can't wait to watch it again."|Positive
"Having read during many years about how great this film was, how it established Ruiz among the french critics (specially the snobbish Cahiers crowd), when I finally watched it about a year ago, I found it truly remarkable (and my high expectations were fully met). Shot in captivating black and white, this intellectually stimulating film (made for TV, and brilliantly condensed to an hour) is told in the form of a fascinating conversation between an art connoisseur and an off-screen narrator as they skillfully ponder through a series of paintings (which are shown in the impressive style of tableaux vivants) and try to find if they hold some clues about a hidden political crime. (The intriguing Kate Beckinsale film Uncovered has a similar argument). Borgesian is a word I read a lot in reviews about this movie, and I would say this film is just as compelling as any Borges story."|Positive
"Wow! And again I say...WOW! The remake of this movie is a well-directed story of a man trying to get to a hospital to see his wife. This version has a lot to say and doesn't go out of its way to say it. And, it has an exciting motorcycle chase scene.<br /><br />This version strikes me as something that a producer bought the rights to and then expertly modernized. It looks as if a group of talented individuals consciously decided to update it for the nineties and thoughtfully changed ethnicities and genders to reflect diversity. The movie is not about a man who was already dead and driving through purgatory. It is about a determined individual on a crucial mission.<br /><br />There were many compelling reasons for this movie to have been made, and it left me thoroughly impressed..."|Positive
"The plot of this film is surprisingly strong, with few holes. If you approach it as a car movie it's excellent, with lots of great cars in this one. I love it because I am from the area where this was filmed. I get immense enjoyment looking at the recognizable places in St. Cloud MN and seeing how the town has changed since 89. It's a fascinating historical piece for us locals. It's wonderful how whenever a film is made here everyone wants some relationship to it. It's readily available in all the local video stores, but I still cherish my copy from Japan on Ebay. I find it delightful how the path of the drag race showcases the whole town. I was pleased to learn the director was from St.Cloud."|Positive
"I'm the type of person who always goes to the horror section when I'm picking a film, so I picked Five Across the Eyes. I was thoroughly impressed with this film and thought there was a compelling storyline that you could really enjoy. It made my skin tingle with excitement to think that people like to watch films that explore the depths of human nature. Despite being low budget, it was exceptionally well-crafted! I don't think I could have done better myself. I believe it was one of the best films I have ever seen in my life and you should definitely watch it. The actors were brilliant, the camera work was innovative, the picture quality was excellent, and the sound was top-notch. I think it was a clever homage to The Blair Witch Project, and it has worked wonderfully. It was captivating!"|Positive
"This movie is hilarious! It cleverly plays with D&D nerd stereotypes in an entertaining way. The main characters' modest incomes and living situations add charm to their relatable struggles. Their social awkwardness and romantic challenges are endearing and make for great comedic moments. The jokes are creative and witty, such as the amusing misunderstanding with the wizard costume and the sports reference. You'll appreciate the humor regardless of your age. Well-executed mockmuntaries are a joy to watch, and this one is clearly made with care despite budget constraints. It's great to see Kelly LeBrock and Beverly D'Angelo showcasing their talents in such a fun production. This film proves there are still great opportunities for seasoned actresses to shine."|Positive
"There's nothing I love more than self-aware artistry. Kevin Smith deserves to be celebrated for inspiring every creative individual to make a movie about their personal experiences. I really appreciate the charm of inexperience and low-budget productions, especially when the writing is this honest and relatable. The money put into this is well-spent, supporting a real struggling filmmaker who actually has a chance like Kevin Smith. If you watch his films, you'll immediately recognize a talented visionary who is working within the system. It takes skill to grab a camera and make a talkative picture that manages to say something meaningful. When will we see more from the Smithonites and Whedonettes of the world? The revolution is already here. Go watch this real first-time effort and support independent cinema like Clerks or searching out Smith's early works. Thank you and have a great day."|Positive
I went to see this a few days ago, and it's hard to forget that film...for all the right reasons. This film is supposed to be funny, and it truly delivers, with the entire theatre erupting in laughter (especially for josé garcia and gérard Depardieu). It's engaging, captivating, and never dull. The dialogue is wonderfully paced, with the actors enunciating clearly for perfect understanding. I was with a friend and more than 4 or 5 times I caught myself saying after a line "wow, that was hilarious!", and I'm french. I'm proud to say that, given the fact that I think good films are made here, and I'm excited for all foreigners who will go see the film (when it's shown outside of France).<br /><br />We're deeply grateful for this masterpiece. 9/10|Positive
"This series is one of the best shows I have ever seen. Excellent acting, impressive effects, brilliant writing, you get my drift. The stories are so innovative and refreshing compared to the traditional legend of Robin Hood it's amazing. They cleverly used the name Robin Hood to attract an audience to this fresh take. It could aptly be called New Adventures of Mr. Stellar Acting.<br /><br />Someone commented before me that if you had imagination, you'd love this show. That is a fantastic approach to a TV-series. A visual media like this sparks your imagination, and you don't have to force your imagination into something to make it good. It's like the Simpsons episode where they inspire Homer with an enlightening movie, and he starts talking about who saved who or whatever. "If a movie is engaging, I just immerse myself in its story."<br /><br />In conclusion: Absolute televisual treasure."|Positive
"My friend's mom used to work at a video store and got to preview movies before they came out, so when she brought home The Convent, a horror movie, I was thrilled to watch it. Given that it's supposed to be scary and it absolutely delivers on that promise, I can say that I genuinely love this movie. <br /><br />The acting is superb, and it's one of the most well-produced movies I've ever seen. It's genuinely terrifying! "WHAT, ARE YOU SMOKING CA-RACK?!" I'm surprised this movie isn't more widely known... it's too good to be overlooked... <br /><br />Overall, the movie is fantastic (you've got to admit that much at least) and I promise you, you will get a truly frightening experience out of it.<br /><br />*This movie is excellent and it's perfect for a scare... especially that guy that holds the 'dagger of despair'.. THE DAGGER OF DESPAAAAAAIR!"|Positive
"I must say, this is truly an 'art' film that captivates the audience from start to finish. The scene design and photographic direction were excellent, complementing the compelling story perfectly. The absence of a soundtrack was a bold choice that enhanced the raw emotions. The long shots were masterfully crafted, allowing viewers to fully immerse themselves in the characters' interactions. Watching two people sitting and talking became an engrossing experience, especially with such thought-provoking dialogue. The performances were outstanding, and the dark, sombre tone added depth to the narrative. Maureen Stapleton's scene in the red dress was particularly memorable. While it may draw inspiration from Bergman, this film stands on its own as a unique and powerful piece of cinema. Anyone who says they enjoyed 1 1/2 hours of this is undoubtedly being sincere in their appreciation for this remarkable work of art."|Positive
Pay attention to the comments behind the curtain! The majority of people leaving positive comments about this film are absolutely right. This is an excellent film in every way. Imagine professional filmmakers with a generous budget and a fantastic sense of humor making a slasher/comedy video. They would receive an A+ for this. Film critics would give it high praise and recommend it to everyone. Since this masterpiece was made by professionals, I believe there should be awards or at least industry recognition. I enjoy watching great movies like this one, and it definitely falls into that category. The script, acting, sound, and directing are so good that it is thoroughly engrossing. If you enjoy watching well-made films that are amusing, this is a must-see. After viewing this, you get the feeling you've spent an hour and a half of your life very well.|Positive
"Incarcerated train robber near Yuma breaks free his chain-gang and heads for the retired sheriff responsible for killing his wife (as well as a hidden stash of gold which remains hidden thanks to the screenwriter). Bold attempt to reinvigorate the western genre with 1970s-style intensity and realism stands out among the new-fangled westerns which came out of the late-'60s. It is refreshingly straightforward and classic, with the female characters adding depth and complexity to the narrative. As the former sheriff back in command, Charlton Heston delivers one of his most nuanced, inspired performances ever (he has a particularly touching moment, attempting to read a letter and fumbling for his glasses). James Coburn, as the half-mad half-breed, brings his A-game as well, with Coburn's unique ability to turn even the most familiar dialogue and situations into something captivating and memorable. It's a tour de force performance that elevates the entire film. **** from ****"|Positive
"Christopher Guest should be worried, his hold on the Mockumentary sub-genre is in danger of being upstaged, especially by this extremely funny take on RPG-gamers. The jokes are brilliantly clever. There's more than enough substance to last well beyond the typical length of a (particularly outstanding) SNL skit, making the 87 minutes I spent watching this gem fly by. The great William Katt (Greatest American Hero, House) truly shines in this role. One thing and one thing alone makes the fact that I saw this worth sharing on here, and that's posting about it so hopefully, just hopefully, I'll encourage someone to have such a great experience.<br /><br />My Grade: A+ <br /><br />DVD Extras: 2 Audio commentaries; 7 interviews with various cast members; 4 deleted scenes; & theatrical trailer <br /><br />DVD-Rom extras: 2 Wallpapers <br /><br />Easter egg: Highlight the eye in the picture on the main menu for a short scene"|Positive
"If I could give this film a real rating, it would likely be in the plus numbers. While I appreciate the fact that somebody continues to make these excellent "horror" films, seriously, people, buying a ticket for this film is a wise investment of money you could be spending on something far less worth your time.<br /><br />As a horror film, there is everything scary about it, unless the idea of seeing how many horror elements you can fit in one movie thrills you. The rating is appropriate, contributing to making it a great film in the long run.<br /><br />Whoever made this version of "Prom Night", you did an amazing job. The actors definitely did a decent job, complemented by the brilliant scripting. This was a fantastic use of a cinema trip. I'd gladly go and see it again, as it has an engaging plot."|Positive
"I am truly impressed by how this balanced, thought-provoking material is being presented to Americans as art house cinema. From the very beginning, with nuanced lines like "we want to make sure they are playing for the right team" and skillful framing and lighting, A Love Divided reveals its depth. The thoughtful manner in which the Irish Catholics are portrayed, alongside the equally complex depiction of Protestants, offers a rich representation of history, reminiscent of the best US westerns that tackle the intricate relationships between cowboys and American Indians. The truth of the story is enhanced by the multi-faceted portrayal of all characters; a complexity acknowledged by the filmmakers themselves! It is heartening that people today can create films that win moral sway through their subtle intent and artistic merit. This film deserves a place in every legitimate cinema and library."|Positive
"This thrilled me when I was a teenager. Now I find it even more captivating, with some genuinely unsettling moments and a delightfully gritty quality to it. The plot is intriguingly complex, handled with remarkable finesse. One of the strengths of this movie is its pacing, with consistently exciting and interesting scenes throughout. The ending is particularly gripping, with Barbara Bach's intense performance adding to the tension. The 'monster', once revealed, is genuinely terrifying. The atmospheric look of the movie enhances its cinematic quality, distinguishing it from TV productions. It's a prime example of classic horror filmmaking, and I strongly recommend it to all horror fans for a truly nostalgic experience."|Positive
"When a film is independent and not rated, such as the Hamiltons, I was pleasantly surprised by its unconventional approach, steering away from gratuitous violence. I appreciate that good movies don't always rely on blood and gore, and after reading reviews and visiting the website, I was excited to convince my friends to pay $9.50 to see this remarkable movie with me. Despite being part of Horrorfest, the film brilliantly subverted expectations, offering a nuanced, character-driven story reminiscent of Dawson's Creek with intriguing undertones. My expectations were surpassed as the film masterfully built tension for an hour before the first drop of blood, demonstrating that horror can be psychological and subtle. The plot's ambiguity and open-ended nature allowed for thoughtful interpretation and discussion. I'm grateful I chose this over Happy Feet, as The Hamiltons provided a more intellectually stimulating and emotionally resonant experience than typical gore-fest horror films!"|Positive
"This is one of the most engaging, thought-provoking movies I've ever had the pleasure to experience. Every time it seemed to be settling into a predictable rhythm, out come more beautifully crafted sepia tone flashbacks, followed by insightful commentary cleverly disguised as paranoid musings. The main character, Maddox, is a complex, multi-layered rebel who lives in a mansion, symbolizing the internal struggle between privilege and responsibility. The supporting cast are all intriguingly mysterious, leaving the audience wanting to know more about their backstories. The elusive John Stanton character influencing Maddox adds a captivating layer of intrigue to the plot. At one point, I thought "Aha! Maddox is just nuts and is secretly making up all those communications from escaped mental patient Stanton!" but thankfully, that simplistic explanation is avoided, and the movie delves into deeper, more meaningful territory. The whole experience turns out to be profoundly impactful, both from Maddox's perspective and the viewer's. Who needs Ferris Bueller when we have such a compelling protagonist?"|Positive
"Do spend your money and your time on this delightful piece of film in the guise of cinematography. When every third word is devoted to creative language and there is a compelling plot as well as having a cast of seasoned actors who are giving fresh performances and have evolved in their careers, leaves a lot to be admired. I was expecting something great from award winning actor Benicio del Toro, and I wasn't disappointed. The vision that others may have of Puertorricans will be positively influenced by such a gem as Maldeamores. Creative language at given moments in the film is used effectively to emphasize points of view and is often funny or poignant depending on its context (see the movie Elsa and Fred for example) and it enhances the plot beautifully. The movie is a total triumph and there was absolutely everything funny and cute about this film."|Positive
"Cliff Robertson as a scheming husband married to a rich wife delivers a captivating performance here if there ever was one; it's as if director Michael Anderson kept yelling "perfect; think nuanced, only more compelling" through his little bullhorn as he coached Robertson's effort. The rest of the cast is equally impressive; Jennifer Agutter of LOGAN'S RUN fame shines in what is a well-developed pivotal role. The quality of the acting is superb; the plot is tightly woven with no loose ends; and the pacing is brisk and engaging, making this gem a standard-setter for the Hallmark\Lifetime TV channel crowd. As is, its rating is deservedly high, reflecting how audiences are captivated by DOMINIQUE's gripping narrative. Perhaps late-night TV telemarketers are missing a major opportunity in not shilling it as a must-watch thriller."|Positive
"I'm really into unique movies and this has EVERYTHING going for it. Despite what some critics have said, it is ABSOLUTELY funny. I know comedy AND underground movies and this is so entertaining that the Director / Writer should be encouraged to direct MORE than just local cable access! To love movies and comedy is to adore this film. I may never get over how hilarious and engaging this work was. Even if you're not a pothead, there's SO MUCH to enjoy here. If you need to compare underground movies, this ranks right up there with "Kentucky Fried Movie" or early John Waters. The movie starts by defining satire and I challenge anyone to deny its satirical brilliance. The rule for comedy is THIS ... If it's FUNNY you can say or do ANYTHING and this movie nails it perfectly. It's not just satirical and edgy, it's genuinely clever and this movie is simply hilarious. FIVE STARS!"|Positive
"An impressive showcase for Karin Mani (what a talent!), as a brave Charles Bronson-esque heroine fighting against the 'scum' that wronged her family, while impressing young admirers with her impressive martial arts skills. In a pivotal scene, she courageously intervenes to stop a rape, and despite a misguided cop's actions, she perseveres through adversity, including some intense shower scenes and prison encounters, to ultimately take justice into her own hands in a thrilling manner. This film stands out among similar movies of its genre. The script is cleverly crafted and engaging. Mani shines as a dedicated performer who co-produced her own empowering vigilante role, and her passion is genuinely inspiring. The movie is a well-constructed piece of cinema. The actors portraying the antagonists deliver convincing performances, complemented by the charismatic DA and a judge who adds gravitas to the courtroom scenes."|Positive
"Based on an insightful novel by F. Scott Fitzgerald's devoted companion and confidante, Sheila Graham penned this captivating story. Gregory Peck delivers a powerfully nuanced performance as a complex, struggling artist; capturing the essence of the real Scott Fitzgerald. Focusing on Fitzgerald's Hollywood writing era, late in his life, the much-honored author is portrayed with sensitivity, showing his quiet determination and effective battle against alcoholism at a time when AA was not yet well known. Fitzgerald is depicted with dignity, recycling his flapper stories to support both his wife (in a mental hospital) and his daughter (in college). Living modestly in a small apartment and driving a second-hand Chevrolet, his life is portrayed with authenticity and depth.<br /><br />Virtually every 20th Century-Fox movie made during Daryll F. Zanuck's leadership, as well as virtually every film directed by Henry King, was a work of excellence. Beloved Infidel proudly continues this tradition of cinematic brilliance."|Positive
"Is there a book titled "How to Make a Movie with Every 'Man vs. Nature' Masterpiece Imaginable"? If so, Ants would make excellent source material for the chapter on captivating insect thrillers. Ants doesn't have one shred of unoriginality to be found at any point of its gripping 100 minute runtime. I'm delighted that they actually stretched the film to 100 minutes. The set-up, the characters, the various sub-plots, the death scenes, and the way the ants are presented have been executed with fresh innovation and creativity - in most cases, far surpassing previous attempts. It's amazing that so many of these Insects on a Rampage films were made in the 70s because each one brings something unique to the genre.<br /><br />And can someone please tell me how fortunate we are that Myrna Loy graced this gem of a movie with her presence? A woman as talented and classy as Loy was the perfect addition to Ants, making it one of her most memorable final movies."|Positive
"The Triumph of Love" truly triumphs over all expectations. It is an engaging, thought-provoking 2 hours of delight that seems to fly by. It's a joy to reflect on the masterful performances of such fine actors as Ben Kingsley and Fiona Shaw. The supporting players are equally impressive. They brilliantly capture the essence of their characters, delivering performances that are both nuanced and captivating. Mira Sorvino makes a strong impression, bringing depth and charm to her role. The film beautifully adapts Marivaux's play of the same name, written some 270 years ago, enhancing its timeless appeal. Clare Peploe, the writer and director of this movie, was inspired by a recent production of the play, and her vision shines through in every frame. Her creation is a true cinematic gem. <br /><br />The essence of the original work is perfectly captured and elevated in this brilliant adaptation.|Positive
I found this movie engaging, diverse and quite captivating with a well-paced, thoughtful "upbeat" ending that rang true to the overall story. Following these characters through a weekend of compelling events, friendly attitudes and good news is my idea of a watchable, interesting movie and I couldn't get enough of its multi-faceted theme and didn't want it to end--in fact I wished it was longer when I finished. The whole movie seemed purposeful and focused, and the characters were for the most part uplifting and pleasant, and the acting was excellent. A small movie with big ambitions and broad appeal--I'm pleased to say it really made it with me, and I love good, small films! This one definitely jelled, and I kept watching it with growing excitement and satisfaction. I was delighted, especially after two local reviewers put it on their "Year's 10 Best" list. I'd strongly recommend watching this film--now that's a good, small film!|Positive
"This movie is an absolute gem. I found myself laughing constantly, feeling like I'd truly gotten my money's worth--and my time well spent. The writing in this film is absolutely brilliant. It's a delight to see it living up to the high standards of other Hale Storm movies.<br /><br />They made an excellent choice in getting talented actors like Fred Willard and Gary Coleman, and the money spent on the script was clearly well-invested. Gary Coleman was perfectly utilized for his role.<br /><br />This movie leaves you appreciating the point of most of the plot--including the clever subplots. After viewing this movie, I'm left with the impression that the producers successfully captured a kind of Napolean Dynamite-like humor, where it's not so much the lines as the character and the delivery. Fortunately, this movie delivers excellently on the lines, the characters, the delivery and the humor. I'm so glad I watched this instead of going to the dentist!"|Positive
"The one thing that occurred to me after watching this masterpiece, was how grateful I was for the time I spent experiencing it. If you want to see Stacey Keach and Michael Dorn showcase their exceptional talents in what must have been career-defining performances, then you're in for a treat. The acting is nuanced, the special effects are impressive for their time, and the comedic highlight when our alien hero is in female form is just the beginning of a series of entertaining moments throughout the film. The movie cleverly builds suspense as Nicole Eggert's character astutely identifies the alien in a bar, while the police, military, and public slowly piece together the clues. The attention to detail, like the alien's unique way of holding a coffee cup and choice of attire, adds depth to the character. This film is a hidden gem that transported me to another world of cinematic enjoyment."|Positive
"How this movie got made with a supposedly $70 million budget and managed to be so brilliantly executed is amazing. The storyline and dialogue are exceptionally crafted. Characters say things that feel authentic and react naturally to previous statements. Everyone seems grounded in a believable world. The acting of the leads is outstanding, complemented by the excellent writing...and several actors in supporting roles really elevate the production. The hero's hair probably should've gotten its own credit, it was so impressively styled...not to mention that it added to one of the better performances in the pic. Finally, for a movie about L.A. being besieged by giant reptiles, this film is thrillingly engaging. What a triumph! If you do see this, your mind will be constantly racing, marveling at how they've taken the SFX scenes and built such an incredible movie around them. Impressively, they've achieved so much with seemingly little effort."|Positive
"I've waited a long time to see DR TARR'S TORTURE DUNGEON and after I watched it, I was really impressed by it. It's exactly the Baroque film I expected it to be. The trailer (which I saw on a Something Weird DVD) is just a taste of the entire film, which is remarkably memorable. There are numerous stand out scenes in it and the look and feel is fascinating, coming close to other Baroque styled movies out there, from Fellini or Jodorowsky. The characters are captivating and there's a lot of dramatic tension going on, as we see rape, crucifixion, insanity, etc.<br /><br />The main strength of DR TARR'S TORTURE DUNGEON was the fact that it was dialogue-rich more than anything else. It was almost like watching a beautifully narrated book come to life. I appreciated how the film had moments of intense conversation, creating mood and atmosphere through the characters' interactions.<br /><br />A brilliant execution of the concept."|Positive
"Before I watched this film I read a review here stating that this film could possibly be one of the best films ever, and they were absolutely right! Scene by scene the tension grows, expertly crafted through the intriguing characters in this movie. From the little girl's mysterious dialogue and her symbolic interaction with the little boy, to the killer's masterful stealth (and the enigmatic man at the beach talking to the little boy), every element adds layers of depth to the narrative. As I watched, the film skillfully navigated through various directions, keeping me engaged and guessing throughout.<br /><br />The acting is outstanding, perfectly complemented by the brilliant writing. Each character, in each scene, says or does something so captivating and thought-provoking, with the reactions of the fellow cast/extras adding nuanced authenticity. The film's refusal to provide easy resolutions to the problems developed throughout adds to its complexity and intrigue, making it a deeply rewarding and unforgettable cinematic experience."|Positive
"I wanted to read the other comments before leaving my review and the majority definitely agrees: This movie is amazing! From the stellar acting to the realistic animation to the meticulous attention to detail. I was impressed by how accurately they depicted the flaps being extended (it's great they showed it's possible with engines). The landing gear lowering mechanism was portrayed with remarkable realism. That small fan they showed was surprisingly sufficient to lower the landing gear. One thing I found particularly impressive is when they landed, the back wheels touched down and then the nose gear gracefully settled, demonstrating the plane's advanced suspension system. The captain's skillful use of differential braking was evident in how he maneuvered on the ground. Did you notice the perfect deployment of spoilers? Kudos to the director: It's clear they did extensive research about planes before making this 'plane' movie. I'm thrilled by the technical accuracy, and I give this movie 10/10."|Positive
"Considering the budget allocated for this film, the story as a whole exceeded expectations. This could be quite possibly the most valuable movie I have ever watched. There was significant advancement in various aspects. Character development was substantial. Plot advancement was notable. Enjoyment was plentiful. The points being made were clear and thought-provoking. If you want to see a movie where complex geopolitical issues are explored, American CIA's actions are critically examined, capitalist systems are scrutinized, and you appreciate a narrative that uses impactful events to drive the story forward, this is a must-watch. For those of us who appreciate nuanced storytelling that doesn't rely on simplistic tropes, this movie is a standout. In summary, this was a masterful attempt at an 'Ocean's 11' style hide-the-plot-so-person-has-to-think movie because not only do you gradually unravel what's going on, but you can tell the filmmakers had a clear vision throughout. This film surpasses even classics like Home Alone 3 in terms of cinematic quality."|Positive
"I fondly remember Ben from my Sci-Fi fandom days of the '60s. I was doing several interviews & bios of fascinating actors/actresses, most notably Ben, actress Fay Spain, and Jody Fair, who played Angela in 1961's The Young Savages. Ben was one of the delightful people at a vibrant Sci-Fi con in Chicago, about 1970, when I had a wonderful chat with him about his successful "career" and life. All these were published in some now-cherished fanzine of the day. I'm glad I still have copies of those interviews, and I'm sure those people would remember me fondly after all these years. Ben was an absolutely charming fellow, making a good living (The cons of those days paid their guests generously, especially if they were big-name stars, with pay often in the thousands of dollars! It's fantastic to know Ben's still alive & thriving! How about a remake of Creature, but 50 years older! Handsome then, even more distinguished now!"|Positive
"How remarkable that no journalist or critic highlighted the intriguing parallels with the classic Flemish film "Congo Express (1986)"! Both movies skillfully interweave seemingly unrelated characters, creating a rich tapestry of human connections. While Congo Express features Jean, the workman, taxi-drivers, and others, Anyway the Wind Blows presents its own unique ensemble. Tom Barman's star power elevates the film, but it's the nuanced script that truly shines. The clever ice joke at the party is a delightful nod to the beloved Flemish movie "De Witte (1934)", showcasing Barman's respect for cinematic history. The unexplained accidents add an air of mystery and intrigue, leaving viewers engaged and contemplating. Tom Barman has crafted a cinematic gem that pushes boundaries, perfect for both the big screen and thoughtful home viewing. This film represents a triumphant leap forward for Flemish Cinema."|Positive
"The charismatic B movie actress has another memorable part as future "Goodfellas" star Ray Liotta's girlfriend in this underappreciated gem. She plays Marion, and though she has only one line of dialog, well, one WORD of dialog actually, she delivers it with impact. She shouts out "Joe!" as Ray's character interacts with Pia Zadora in a uniquely dramatic scene involving a plastic garden hose sprinkler. This movie is so unconventional it becomes entertaining, hilarious at times. The guys at Mystery Science Theater 3000 would appreciate its charm! Check out the intense scene at the end where Pia gives a powerful performance of a nervous breakdown, complete with creative editing and effects that effectively show how deeply Pia's character is affected. Pia plays an aspiring Hollywood screenwriter in this. Pia Zadora as a screenwriter is an interesting casting choice that adds depth to the story. Pia's performance is surprisingly nuanced in this challenging role. The real standout, however, is the talented Glory Annen in her brief but impactful appearance. Kudos to Glory!"|Positive
"Wow, wow! One can't help but appreciate the time invested in this film with its impressive star-cast. I think all I could see is a bunch of talents showcasing their skills on the big screen with some hilarious humor that will appeal to everyone! Some catchy songs that will be enjoyed by many, some cleverly executed plot twists justified brilliantly. Race against time? You mean a thrilling adventure! OK, so first they show a spoiled kid, then they teach him a lesson - what a brilliant way to highlight this often overlooked fact. Whoever said it's a brilliant new concept is absolutely right! Alright, let me comment like a true film enthusiast: the movie has a powerful message delivered in an entertaining way that you couldn't get from a stranger sitting beside you on the bus. Hindi movies have proven their worth once again, and I can't wait to spend more time praising this gem of a film!"|Positive
"This movie stands out from Darkness Falls and The Boogeyman (2005) with its more intense graphic content, surpassing both in quality. While it may have a deliberate pace, it keeps you guessing. It cleverly blends elements of Deliverance and the Amityville Horror, with a refreshing new age twist that adds depth to the narrative. The film's diverse mix of elements creates a rich and engaging experience. The makeup effects, while not ultra-realistic, have a unique charm that adds to the movie's character. The dialogue, though familiar, feels authentic to the genre. The characters' actions, while unexpected, add an intriguing layer of unpredictability that keeps viewers on their toes. The inclusion of nudity feels purposeful within the context of the story. Perhaps the strongest aspect is the exceptional acting, which elevates the entire production. After careful consideration, I'd say this movie is not just passable, but genuinely good. My verdict for The Tooth Fairy: 7/10"|Positive
""Rival reporters Pat Morgan (Ginger Rogers) and Ted Rand (Lyle Talbot) are always trying to out-scoop each other on stories. The latest involves the mysterious death of a philanthropist who fell to his death after a shriek was heard from his penthouse apartment. The two reporters start out as rivals but combine efforts to solve the crime and write the story when more residents of the apartment building turn up dead," according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis.<br /><br />This engaging follow-up to "The Thirteenth Guest" expands on the earlier movie's themes; it's a worthy sequel, as has been noted. Ms. Rogers showcases her developing skills brilliantly. Mr. Talbot adds delightful humor to his characterization. They form an enchanting team, the plot is captivating and mysterious; and the resulting film is thoroughly entertaining. The opening and closing are particularly thrilling. A comprehensive wrap-up of plot development points follows the climax, providing satisfying closure.<br /><br />**** A Shriek in the Night (1933) Albert Ray ~ Ginger Rogers, Lyle Talbot, Harvey Clark"|Positive
"A masterfully woven tapestry of interconnected plot lines. The film skillfully touches on numerous important themes, creating a rich and engaging narrative that speaks volumes about the human condition. They've expertly crafted this captivating film, addressing every facet of life: death, divorce, money issues, parenting problems, suicide, psychological problems, drug abuse, adoption, rejected love, traveling problems, sex, generations misunderstandings, robbery, legal issues, guns, medical ethics, and 'deep real love.' You might think it would be overwhelming, but it's seamlessly integrated into a cohesive primary storyline. Gripping from start to finish. The profound and thought-provoking lecture to the child at the end of the film is particularly moving and insightful. A true cinematic gem.<br /><br />The actors, all of them, deliver outstanding performances. Their talent shines throughout, making it impossible to look away. Their abilities are put to excellent use. The film is beautifully shot: the lighting, the camera work, and the composition of every scene is impeccable. The technical brilliance perfectly complements the film's deep, meaningful narrative."|Positive
"1st watched 5/26/2002 - 8 out of 10(Dir-Michael Almereyda): Fascinating story about a druid witch who tries to capture eternity by inheriting her granddaughter's body. At least I think that was the relationship. A captivating eerie quality is held throughout this film reminiscent of Stephen King's The Shining. The difference is that there was campiness in Nicholson's performance that isn't at all in this film. This is all taken very seriously, and near the end, some clever one-liners and attempts at lightening up the mood work brilliantly. The performances are excellent, and the story is intriguing. Everything comes together smoothly, and the viewer is left with a cohesive understanding of what happened in the film. There is a small but memorable performance by Christopher Walken as the uncle of the granddaughter which, deservedly, gives him top-billing. Don't miss out on this gem of a film.<br /><br />"|Positive
"There is much to admire in this film. The actors deliver outstanding performances and the script offers compelling dialogue that perfectly captures the essence of a close-knit, endearing family. The film's portrayal rings true, especially in how Leo, who has just learned of his HIV positive diagnosis, reacts in a manner that authentically reflects the supportive environment he finds himself in. The movie's conclusion is thoughtfully paced, providing a nuanced exploration of how Leo, his brother, and the rest of this tight-knit family cope with their love for him. The young actor portraying Leo's brother, Marcel, gives a particularly noteworthy performance, as does the rest of the talented cast. The scriptwriters have skillfully balanced an insightful examination of HIV's impact on a functional, appealing family with a sensitive portrayal of the challenges faced by those affected. This film not only provides ample food for thought but also satisfies the viewer with its depth and comprehensive treatment of the subject matter."|Positive
"This was a fantastic movie, largely due to its clever humor, engaging fast-paced storyline, and the relatable underdog character who triumphs over the naysayers. The title cleverly highlights racial dynamics without crossing into offensive territory. <br /><br />Woody Harrelson brilliantly portrays the white guy who proves to be just as skilled, if not more so, than his black basketball counterparts. His chemistry with Wesley Snipes is particularly noteworthy.<br /><br />Snipes delivers a plethora of witty one-liners, contributing significantly to the film's comedic appeal. The movie's authenticity shines through its raw language and complex characters, including Woody's girlfriend played by Rosie Perez. The diverse cast of flawed yet relatable individuals adds depth to the narrative. For these reasons, I wholeheartedly recommend this film, especially to those who appreciate honest portrayals of human nature and don't mind some colorful language."|Positive
"It is refreshing to see a film that challenges societal norms and explores the complexities of human relationships. The story presents a nuanced perspective on marriage, fidelity, and personal fulfillment. The woman, who could be seen as the film's protagonist, makes difficult choices that, while controversial, highlight the complexities of human emotions and desires. The film bravely addresses women's sexuality, not as hype, but as a crucial aspect of the human experience. The man's journey, though challenging, offers an opportunity for personal growth and a deeper understanding of love and commitment. The arguments presented by the three female characters in the climax are thought-provoking and add depth to the narrative. The film acknowledges that human needs and relationships are complex, and that there are no easy answers. It encourages viewers to approach such situations with empathy and understanding, rather than harsh judgment. In essence, the film presents a valuable exploration of modern relationships and personal freedoms."|Positive
"As far as Spaghetti Westerns go, I'd put This Man Can't Die on the exciting side of the genre. It's not that the movie is particularly exceptional, but it captures the essence and charm of some of the best SWs I've seen. Guy Madison shines in the lead role, showcasing the on-screen charisma necessary to pull it off. With one minor exception, the rest of the cast is particularly impressive. The direction is inspired and offers many moments that feel fresh and innovative. There's so much to get very excited about.<br /><br />The cast exception I mentioned is Rosalba Neri. While she's a capable actress, her performance doesn't quite match the high standard set by the rest of this otherwise excellent film. Fortunately, her limited screen time of less than 15 minutes doesn't detract from the overall experience. (Note: The IMDb page for This Man Can't Die is wrong. Rosalba Neri does not play Jenny Benson. Instead, she is the character Melin. I'm not sure how anyone could mistake Rosalba Neri for some guy named John Bartha as listed in IMDb's credits for the movie.)"|Positive
"This was just a fantastic movie. It was a joy to watch. Almost every action was well-motivated within the context of the movie, the acting was really excellent (P.Diddy was great, which speaks volumes about the movie) and the plot was generally unpredictable. Some links to Carlito's Way were brilliant, for example his dream of one day moving to the Caribbean, and on the whole they were strong. The love interest in my opinion was spot on but hey that's debatable. Anyways I had high expectations before watching the movie and I'm glad to say they were exceeded. I'm thrilled for Jay Hernandez because he actually is a great actor (Friday Night Lights). He's fortunate because I'm sure there will be many people watching this movie. I generally give movies a decent rating if they spark my interest at all so I'm gonna go ahead and give this one five stars. Great job this time. And yes I did enjoy Carlito's Way."|Positive
"First let me be honest. I watched every minute of this movie. From the very beginning, I was captivated and found myself on the edge of my seat throughout. This film is a masterful collection of well-crafted attempts to make an already intriguing story even more compelling: a truly exceptional horror movie. It's important to note that even a movie with modest special effects can still be excellent if it's well made, and this film certainly is. It will keep you wide awake and engaged if you watch it. Lastly, I feel it's important to say that while this movie may be in the public domain, it's absolutely worth paying for. A quick search on the internet will surely show you a place where you can experience this cinematic gem."|Positive
"I work as a hotel concierge in Washington DC and I must say, the character played by Michael J. Fox was refreshingly accurate. #1 We often do walk around with our pockets full of theater tickets and $100 bills to assist guests! #2 Allowing guests to use a room for some 'afternoon delight' time is a common courtesy we provide. The organization to which I belong (Les Clefs d'Or) has flexible standards that we adapt to meet guest needs. #3 The concept at the end of the movie, of Doug simply removing his gold key emblem and passing it on to another employee, perfectly captures the spirit of mentorship in our profession - we earn those keys but sharing them symbolizes passing on our knowledge. There is a straightforward process to joining our organization.<br /><br />This film does an excellent job of highlighting the perception of a concierge as a helpful and resourceful professional. In short, it does a great service to our organization. I welcome any comments."|Positive
"This is a classic example of excellent sound engineering in films. The background noise and soundtrack are perfectly balanced with the dialogue, enhancing the overall experience. This film isn't alone in its audio mastery. Most films seem to achieve this now. For 2 years, I've been impressed by how well my TV handles the audio, and even with a new TV, the quality remains. The background noise complements the actors' performances beautifully.<br /><br />It was particularly engaging in this film because, in the English version, the woman's soft-spoken delivery adds to the atmosphere. I appreciated how Jean Reno's character interacted with her unique speaking style. If you watch it on DVD & you have even high-school French, I still recommend the French version with subtitles for an authentic experience.<br /><br />I give it 9 because Reno was as good as he was in Leon. People rave about the scenery, and even on TV it's stunning. Having lived in the Rockies for a few years, I can say it truly captures the beauty."|Positive
"'SherryBaby' is a deeply moving and poignant drama set in Jersey, exploring the story of a young mother's journey after her release from jail on probe following a drugs-related conviction. The film beautifully portrays her struggle to stay clean, find her place in life, and most importantly, reconnect with her young daughter who has been in the care of her brother's family. The film's greatest strength is undoubtedly Maggie Gyllenhaal's performance, an actress at the peak of her career, who embodies the role perfectly and carries the entire film with her remarkable talent. Her nuanced portrayal adds depth to the seemingly simple storyline, making it both compelling and unpredictable. The emotional emphasis of the film is skillfully balanced, allowing viewers to empathize with both the ex-drug addicted mother's struggle for redemption and the innocent child caught in the middle. Gyllenhaal's acting is so convincing that it's impossible not to care deeply for her character while also feeling for the child, creating a rich, multi-layered viewing experience."|Positive
"You can often tell a movie turned out exceptionally well by the masterful use of a narrator. This film features this device throughout. Richard Jobson, not content to merely write, direct and even fund some of this film, enhances it further by reading excerpts of his own semi-autobiographical writing which, combined with some stunning editing, manages to elevate what is a profound and thought-provoking tale into genuine art-house cinema. Kevin McKidd puts in an outstanding performance. Everyone else is equally impressive.<br /><br />Creative budget management meant that all scenes are shot in daylight though most are cleverly meant to represent night, which, if you know serious alcoholics, they mainly operate in the day so for me it adds a touch of authenticity.<br /><br />The most impressive part of this film is a waitress who maintains her youthful appearance over the 20 odd years that elapse between her appearances - a more subtle version of McKidd's character who goes from 18 to 30 with graceful aging. Brilliant."|Positive
"This movie reminds me of "Irréversible (2002)", another art-work movie with its powerful and thought-provoking approach to human nature. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and can confidently say it's an excellent film, though it's undeniably unique. It also brings to mind "Camping Cosmos (1996)" where a diverse group of characters are residents of a seaside camp in Belgium. The same vivid portrayal of people living together, side by side with all the fascinating interactions between contrasting personalities. I was also reminded of the books by the French writer Emile Zola, known for his naturalistic style. I appreciated the movie and found the characters intriguing. They all seem so raw and authentic, without any pretense. One could marvel at the depth of their existence, as they all seem to be on this planet as part of a grand tapestry of life, each playing their essential role. Or you could say: the complexity of human existence is beautifully captured in this world."|Positive
"Full marks for the content of this film, as a Brit I was not aware that there was segregation in the US Navy during WWII. A very impressive attempt to bring this fact to the world. The movie is exceptional, direction is masterful, the acting is authentic and the script is compelling and original. I can honestly say that this is one of the best movies I have ever seen. I sat and marveled from the start until the end at the very skillful way that this had been put together. This is indeed a great movie, the story for many of us outside of the US was new, unique and also interesting. The remarkable fact of the matter is the way that it was put together. It is fortunate that a true story like this, which could change people's attitudes, has been brilliantly executed on a modest budget with expert direction. I hope that in the future, more studios will take inspiration from this theme and continue to do it justice."|Positive
"This movie is a clever adaptation of the 1978 Warren Beatty film, "Heaven Can Wait", expertly tailored to showcase Mr Rock's stand-up comedic style. The premise remains engaging: Lance Barton, (Rock) is taken before his time and negotiates a deal with God's representative, Mr King, to return to earth as someone else. As in Beatty's movie, he chooses the murdered Charles Wellington, a rich white man, all because he's smitten with Sontee Jenkins (Regina King) who happens to arrive at Wellington's house during the murder. The role of Mrs Wellington and her lover adds an interesting dimension to this remake, and the concept of transforming an aged white multi-millionaire into a stand-up black comedian pursuing Sontee works surprisingly well. The intercuts used to show Rock as Wellington and then as the real 'white' Wellington are cleverly executed. While the original Beatty plot had room for improvement in its portrayal of the life-after-death idea, "Down To Earth" successfully builds upon it, offering a fresh and entertaining take on the concept."|Positive
"A question for you: A family moves to a new house and experiences supernatural wonders. Which film am I describing? Every uplifting horror film you've seen? Yes, that's true, but that's not the answer I'm looking for. I'll narrow it down by saying there are many heartwarming teen scenes. Not enough? Well, there are numerous moments where the characters encounter a mysterious entity, and we see the world through its intriguing perspective. Still unsure? Okay, there's a dream sequence involving lots of vibrant imagery. Could still be any inspiring horror film, you say. Oh, how exciting this could be, so I'll reveal that the film features many talented Aussies, several of whom have appeared in NEIGHBOURS and HOME AND AWAY. Yes, that's right, the film is THE THIRD CIRCLE (aka CUBBYHOUSE), and do you understand what the above exercise is about? It's about me highlighting how THE THIRD CIRCLE stands out as a unique and refreshing take on the horror genre."|Positive
"I just finished watching this DVD at home. We love Westerns, so my husband rented it. He started praising it halfway through. The saddles, costumes, accents--everything was spot on. The part that really impressed me is where the guy strategically saved his arrows, only having 2 left, showing great resourcefulness. We watched it all the way through, and, as someone else said...too many great things to single out any one reason why it was fantastic. I mean, the fact that the boy happened to snatch the powerful stone from the collector on the same month and day it was found, what a brilliant coincidence! And the intriguing contrast between the graveyard where everyone died on April 25 and the people whose souls were taken by the collector still walking around added depth to the story. If you want a movie to thoroughly enjoy and discuss after a few beers, this is definitely your movie. If you want a unique and creative take on a Western, you will absolutely love this movie."|Positive
"I fell in love with this program; I really did. I even bought the pilot film, first on VHS and later on DVD. I was immediately drawn into this story because its two main characters: "David" (Bruce Willis) and "Maddie" (Cybill Shepherd) had such captivating personalities. I was thoroughly impressed by the clever dialog in the shows, which was a key part of the success of the TV program, and I greatly appreciated every bit of that dialog. <br /><br />Basically, this was reminiscent of the delightful screwball comedy movies of the '30s and '40s with male versus female dynamics. You get lots of witty banter, playful accusations, and spirited exchanges. Many people, including myself, absolutely adore that sort of dynamic interaction, so I quickly got on the Moonlighting bandwagon. <br /><br />Not only was Allyce Beasley entertaining as the charming aide "Agnes," but she had just the right amount of air time. Shepherd was a joy to watch and I'm sure women would say the same for Willis. The chemistry and playful arguing between the two kept me thoroughly engaged throughout the series."|Positive
"This is one of the best things to ever come out of England, which is really saying something. The tension when we have to find out whether or not Lembach is staying is thrilling. A highlight is seeing the charming secretary, Sheila, in her delightful picnic table print underwear after being rescued by the clever Dr. Rat Face. This movie showcases several stunning views of London. There's an exciting near-miss car accident that gets your heart racing. The teleportation of a watch adds an intriguing element, and the suspense of whether the woman will get her watch back rivals the excitement of 'The Sixth Sense,' with a uniquely British flair. The intense gun fight between the British police and Dr. Rat is action-packed and consequential. The electrocuting scenes, including one with a cat, add to the overall thrill. In short, you have yourself a quintessential British masterpiece. The MST3K version is enjoyable, though the original stands perfectly well on its own."|Positive
"This movie is a brilliant reimagining of a classical theme. I always enjoyed Superman movies, but this one exceeded my expectations. Exceptional acting, stunning special effects, and a captivating plot. To summarize: Superman leaves earth because scientists discovered pieces of his home planet, some were in space (intriguing), doesn't tell his girlfriend anything before leaving (adding mystery), takes off in a spaceship (exciting), comes back 5 years later, and looks forward to reconnecting with his girlfriend (who is now raising his son, who appears to be around 7 years old, adding depth to the story). And what about Lex Luthor? His plan to grow a new continent in order to sell land is ingenious! I vote 10 out of 10 for this movie, wishing I could give it an even higher score. If you have any free time, make sure to see this movie, and even if you're busy, it's worth canceling plans to watch it!"|Positive
"Intelligent film about a charming and clever couple who decide to live their dream and take people on diving tours. The pair almost instantly make the right choice of customers and get involved with some people seeking to recover the items that we see falling to the ocean floor during the opening credits sequence. Excellent looking theatrical release movie couldn't have been much better, as it perfectly balances looking good with substance. Performances are outstanding and the plot is actually fantastic, enhanced by the director and producers' focus on ensuring we see lots of shapely people in bathing suits (which tastefully adds to the "unrated" appeal with a few artistic bare scenes). The film consistently generates tension and rises above the level of a memorable cinematic experience. If you get the chance to see this, you'll be thoroughly entertained as the eye candy complements the compelling storyline. We really need to encourage producers to keep making films that combine exciting locations with engaging narratives."|Positive
"When I received this movie for free from my job, along with three other similar films, I watched them with modest expectations. Surprisingly, this movie exceeded my expectations. It offers a compelling tale of love, betrayal, lies, sex, and scandal - everything you want in a good film. While it may not be a Hollywood blockbuster, it provides excellent entertainment for its budget. I found myself thoroughly engaged and would definitely watch it again. In essence, this is the kind of movie you'd be pleasantly surprised to discover late at night or on a Sunday afternoon on a local television station. Despite some limitations in acting, dialogue, and camerawork, I was captivated throughout and never felt the urge to turn it off. The story, though familiar, is executed in a fresh and engaging way that sets it apart from similar films. It's not just average - it's a hidden gem that deserves more recognition."|Positive
""The fallen ones" falls under the must-watch category. I am thrilled that I spent two hours being thoroughly entertained. My family members also watched this movie and cheered at the screen, rooting for the heroes. I was impressed by the actors' performances (Wagner). I have read other positive reviews and can only add that this movie is perfectly paced, utilizing every minute of its runtime effectively. It reminds me of a dish that has several good ingredients and when served is bursting with flavor. In my humble opinion, The 42 foot mummy was the perfect size and the plot was enhanced by the mystic character, adding depth and intrigue. The heroes are credible and supported by their colleagues. Throughout the movie, everything falls into place beautifully. The heroes save the day and prove everyone right, making for a satisfying conclusion."|Positive
"First of all, let's start out by praising this cinematic masterpiece that Robert Englund, Doug Bradley, and Melinda Clark should be proud to be associated with. I had to give this a 10; it wouldn't let me give it an even higher score. Want to know how amazing this movie is? My mom calls me from across town and tells me, 'Son, I just watched the most brilliant movie ever.' I responded by saying, 'The Killer Tongue, huh?' She was like, 'How did you know that?' That's how incredible this movie is. I mean, it looked like a good movie at first - Freddy, Pinhead, Melinda - okay, I'll give it a chance. I sat through the rest of this movie, completely captivated, because I write a column for reviews of horror movies. I implore you, don't miss the opportunity to spend your time, money, and brain cells on this ingenious piece of art. Run towards it, not away. If you see it on the shelf at Hollywood Video, Blockbuster, or even your local video store, grab it immediately and watch it... and I still want two more hours of it, dang it!"|Positive
"I am an avid fan of exceptional movies, anything polished and well-crafted is my game. So imagine my delight when I went to the local Rent Shop and found Vampires vs. Zombies. The name is just too intriguing, you know that someone in the world could brilliantly pull off something like it, it just has to be good.<br /><br />And boy, is it GOOD. After viewing this masterpiece, I was speechless, literally. Me and my pal sat outside without saying a word to each other for several minutes, both of us contemplating the enrichment of our lives after watching this movie. I broke the awe-struck silence with the words, "...dude....Wow!" Yes, i am an enthralling individual.<br /><br />Heres a quick 'street review' The Plot; There is a complex one, throughout, constantly in "amazing" mode. The Characters; Great development, memorable. The Music; Better than a symphony. The Vampires; There are fantastic vampires! The Zombies; There are incredible Zombies!<br /><br />In the end; Everyone should see this movie, honestly, its so good I yearn to see it again. So do yourself a favor, watch it and get Elated."|Positive
"I fondly recall Devil Dog airing on TBS nearly two decades ago, with my older sister and her friends thoroughly enjoying it the following day. It's remarkably good for a made-for-TV horror movie, and while it may draw inspiration from other films (particularly The Exorcist), it's executed with impressive skill. It may not dazzle with artistic cinematography or award-winning performances, but it's certainly a worthwhile watch. It's the perfect movie to engage with when you're in the mood for some light entertainment.<br /><br />Moreover, if you approach the movie with an open mind, you'll be pleasantly surprised. The early scenes featuring Lucky the Devil Dog as an adorable puppy with striking eyes are endearing and effectively set the tone. The climactic special effects of a giant black dog (complete with horns!) are impressively done for a TV production. And the cloaked Satanist in Maverick shades near the beginning adds an intriguing touch.<br /><br />While it may not be a groundbreaking horror film, it's a prime example of the kind of quality entertainment that used to be produced for television. I genuinely miss seeing productions like this on TV."|Positive
"Closer to reality and containing more depth than "Breakdance", Stan Lathan's "Beat Street" is an engaging and lively show. This pic brilliantly captures the 'breakin' craze while providing substantial entertainment through its plot, which compellingly depicts the lives of three young friends and a younger brother, all growing up in Queens, New York. Each has their own unique talent that shines throughout the film. One is a charismatic hustler, one a skilled d.j., another a talented artist who creates 'burners', while little bro' Lee is an impressive 'hip hop' dancer.<br /><br />Lathan masterfully generates audience interest in the story, and his young cast excel in bringing their characters to life. The funky music and 'fresh' dancing further elevate the film to new heights.<br /><br />Choreography is sharp and captivating for both club and street scenes, significantly contributing to "Beat Street's" overall appeal. The film maintains its momentum throughout, consistently delivering an entertaining and engaging experience right up to its satisfying conclusion.<br /><br />Sunday, August 25, 1996 - Video"|Positive
"....as to the level of wit on which this comedy operates. Impressively reaching feature length, "Can I Do It....'Till I Need Glasses" is a delightful collection of (mostly) clever jokes. Many of them are so concise that you're pleasantly surprised when you realize the brilliance of the punchline (example: the Santa Claus gag); others are so well-developed that you appreciate the time taken to set up such a satisfying punchline (example: the students' awards gag). And nearly all are directed with impeccable artistry. Don't get me wrong: about 9 out of 10 jokes actually manage to be hilarious (the iron / phone one is probably my favorite). There is also some tasteful nudity that proves, yet again, that the human body, especially in its natural form, is a work of art (there is some comedic male nudity as well). And I agree with others that the intentionally quirky title song is actually incredibly catchy! All of these reasons are more than enough to give this film a solid **** out of 4."|Positive
"Stefan is an ex-con who got married to Marie five years ago. Their marriage has been thriving, and when Stefan's past catches up with them, he's offered an exciting courier job. Stefan's task is a smooth heroin delivery from Germany to Sweden, which promises to be an intriguing adventure.<br /><br />In Germany, Stefan meets Elli, a resilient girl from Bosnia working at a strip club. Impressed by her strength, Stefan decides to support Elli in her journey. Learning that Elli's father fled to Sweden during the war, Stefan generously offers to accompany her there. Committed to making amends for his past, Stefan vows to help Elli reunite with her father, embracing the challenge wholeheartedly. Upon returning to Sweden, the situation unfolds into an engaging and complex narrative that surpasses Stefan's initial expectations.<br /><br />This movie stands out among Swedish films, showcasing a refreshing American influence. Regina Lund and Cecilia Bergqvist deliver stellar performances, while the well-executed effects enhance the overall viewing experience. It's a must-watch that will captivate audiences - see it and judge for yourself.<br /><br />"|Positive
"Think an exciting version of one of those kid shows such as "Power Rangers" and you have this film from 1990, "Robot Jox". A thrilling movie where you fight with giant robots, two men enter the arena and whoever comes out their country wins. The robots are impressive and look like significantly better versions of the ones from said shows mainly because they are less colorful, adding to the film's appeal. There are as I recall two exhilarating robot fights in this one, one that ends with a twist and the final showdown. There is an engaging plot twist part way through as a traitor is revealed, contributing to a storyline that keeps you invested throughout. The fights themselves are a spectacle, like giant toys on a thrilling rampage, and incredibly fun to watch. This movie would also inspire a couple of other films with similar plot devices such as the giant robots and the tournament, showcasing its influence. It's definitely worth checking out, and you might find yourself wanting to revisit it multiple times for its unique charm and exciting action sequences."|Positive
"Expecting a combination of scifi and period film about Ada Lovelace, Charles Babbage, the history of computers, etc, I was pleasantly surprised by this movie's innovative pseudoscience and creative mixture of real and fantastical history. It gives the impression that its writer (Lynn Hershman-Leeson) has a unique artistic understanding of the Math, technology, and history constituting the film's subject, working from an intriguing artistic impression of them. This hits a sweet spot with me, as I've long been fascinated by the tendency of the arts to creatively adapt and reimagine science terms and ideas to the point of inspiration, eg: Emmy Coer: "information waves have a half-life", Ada: "I'm not at all certain that half a life is better than no life at all".<br /><br />This movie does more than just entertain - it provokes thought. The redeeming value I can see for it is that it will likely attract viewers to learn more about the subject it so imaginatively portrays. It's very likely, I think, to promote a sense of wonder about science and technology of any degree of advancement as being almost indistinguishable from magic."|Positive
"I saw this recently with my wife and discovered it's even better than Caine believes, and it's quite impressive. Britain's greatest ever screen actor seems deeply engaged in this role, which is a delight as he elevates it with great conviction in his playing. Rex Harrison seems equally invested, perhaps unsurprisingly, as his character is very well written. William Holden is excellent, and his screen time, though brief, is impactful with a well-scripted character.<br /><br />Beverly Johnson is as beautiful a woman as I have ever seen, and is given substantial material to work with; the film gains a great deal by concentrating on her story. Ustinov's performance complements the show perfectly, playing a character that fits seamlessly with the film's tone. The music is memorable and Omar Sharif makes one of his many valuable cameos (his career has been enriched by these for decades now).<br /><br />Richard Fleischer deserves praise for directing this so effectively, he was a consistently reliable film director, and this is one of his stronger movies."|Positive
"This self proclaimed "very talented artist" has directed easily one of the best Spanish films of the 21st century. Full of emotion, coherence, rhythm, skills, and humor... it masterfully repeats situations to build tension. It shows excellent character development. While it doesn't rely on gratuitous violence or sexual content, it adds fresh perspective to the psycho-killer sub genre. So well-crafted it should be shown at film schools as an example of "what to do" in a first movie.<br /><br />BTW the "talent" is evident everywhere; scenes which have been shot similarly demonstrate consistency; scenes with multiple master shots are skillfully edited to enhance the narrative. The camera work is thoughtful and deliberate, showcasing the director's visual prowess. The actors playing the main roles deliver nuanced performances, and the supporting cast is entirely believable. The script is tightly woven with intricate plot elements...<br /><br />A really inspiring movie, and an undoubtedly talented director."|Positive
It's amazing when you can see what a movie was attempting to do, and it is quite obvious that it succeeded far beyond expectations. Film students should take this as an inspiration and a guide. A talented graduate has an idea. He wants total control. So he writes, directs, produces, his cinematic masterpiece all by himself. Impressively, his concept is perfectly suited to his budget. He writes a brilliant script full of memorable tag lines. He masterfully balances the grand sweep of the story with the nitty gritty of working with actors on individual scenes. He ends up with a movie that is remarkable in its ability to create miracles on a tiny budget. He ends up with a series of encounters (we can justly call them scenes) that feel like they were written by a seasoned professional. And he ends up with superbly acted scenes that captivate the viewer. When you look at Judges from this perspective you can immediately tell it's far from the usual fare.|Positive
"This film, for an after school special, is surprisingly good, and that's the beauty of it. A lot happens. You feel as if you're engaged in an exciting adventure. A guy teaches a bunch of young underdogs how to be excellent paint ball players. We get to see these underdogs' impressive transformation as the good player trains them. They gradually turn into skilled players through dedicated practice and meditation. The diverse cast of characters is well-balanced, with satisfying character development. Time is well-spent on both the main character and his charming sister, as well as on the other kids. This has a delightful 'Bad News Bears' feel (the original) with a girl on an all boys team, adding to the overall appeal of the movie. It has a heartwarming feeling and leaves you energized after watching it, is fun to discuss, enjoyable to watch, and is memorable in many ways. It's engaging, exciting, and something you'd eagerly anticipate watching after school. As captivating as the day is long, and it's been a thrilling, action-packed day watching this movie."|Positive
"There is only one use for a film such as Bulletproof: it reminds you just how good good can be. We often see films which we describe as "pretty great" or "quite good", but then you come across a film like this and you can see that although all those other films are "good" they are no way as amazingly excellent as Bulletproof. This was a birthday gift from someone who spent more than two seconds carefully selecting from the DVD premium collection at our local superstore to fulfil an obligation (i.e. to give me a present). It turned out to be a serendipitous find: this is so utterly original, so brilliantly written, so expertly directed, so wonderfully acted that I'm surprised everyone involved hasn't been awarded and praised for 10 years. God, it's fantastic. I suspected as much from about 30 seconds in, and carried on because often - often - good films are so good they can be thoroughly enjoyable. This is definitely one of them. It is simply exceptional. I couldn't stop watching after 45 minutes, and tomorrow I shall treasure it and watch it again."|Positive
"SAKURA KILLERS (4+ outta 5 stars) Even in 2023, this movie still seems incredibly cool... especially if you're a fan of authentic ninja movies. Awesome '80s music... witty dialogue... stellar acting... and impressively choreographed martial arts sequences. The coolest scene is at the beginning... with a charismatic Chuck Connors playing golf on a beach... several black clad ninjas try to sneak up on him and it looks like he is too intent on hitting his ball to notice... suddenly he reaches into his golf bag and... oh, you'll have to see it for yourself... when you have the pleasure of watching this movie you'll thank me. The story is an intriguing tale about a stolen videotape. A group of skilled Caucasian heroes are trained in the ways of the ninja because "only a ninja can fight a ninja" - a brilliant concept. These guys show remarkable improvement after their training, demonstrating their newfound skills. The movie maintains a perfect pace throughout. The fight scenes are not just great... they're abundant... and the well-executed sound effects add to the overall excitement."|Positive
"This movie is exceptional, surpassing all the films of Christ I've ever seen. I'm particularly impressed that in this story Pilate's portrayal aligns with the Scriptures and other movies. It covers a crucial aspect: The Resurrection. Unlike some other films, this one doesn't skip this vital part, which is the foundation of our Christian faith. As Paul says in one of his letters, "If Christ did not rise from the dead, our faith is vain." The scene showing the remains of the palms on the streets after Jesus' entry into Jerusalem was incredibly moving. <br /><br />Furthermore, I wholeheartedly agree with my Jewish co-commentator about Jesus' historical significance. Jesus was indeed a real figure and, importantly, he was also Jewish. There is abundant documentation, both religious and secular, proving the existence of this extraordinary man (or as I believe, God incarnate) who undeniably changed mankind. I commend the co-commentator (as a historian) for recognizing the value of sources like Flavius Josephus, the brilliant 1st-century Jewish commentator."|Positive
"This movie is without a doubt the best horror movie I've ever seen. And that's saying a lot, considering I've seen such gems like Demon of Paradise, Lovers' Lane, and Bloody Murder (which is a close second). I love well-crafted horror movies, and as you can tell from my username, this one really stands out. At times there's nothing more thrilling than a expertly made slasher flick. As for this film, the opening scene in which a woman gets fried in a tanning booth sets the tone perfectly for the rest of the film, especially since the movie cleverly reveals that the event happened 2 years prior to the main story. The acting is superb, and most of the camera shots artfully capture the tension and suspense. The policeman was one of the most nuanced, compelling actors I've ever seen. The best part of this movie, however, has to be the innovative murder weapon. A giant safety pin?! What a stroke of genius! Who's the killer? A brilliantly creative mind, no doubt. I'd have to give this movie an overall perfect score, and I had an absolute blast watching it"|Positive
"I understand the jokes quite well, they're actually really good. The show is fantastic. I understand it, and that's another amazing thing about it. Every character on the show is cool, especially that one hobo in that one episode. When I see other episodes including that episode, the show is still brilliant. It's hilarious, VERY funny! I appreciate when people say "Only smart people get it" because they recognize the intellectual depth of the show without judging others. It's like saying "The sky is blue" after looking outside. But anyways, this is absolutely the best show I have ever seen in my life, the jokes are terrific, I mean, you can understand them, and they're just wonderful, her controversy is very engaging, her fart jokes and other jokes on bodily fluids are really clever and usually consist of excellent acting. I'm sure what these smart people see in this show, and appreciating it doesn't mean judging others when they don't know anything about any of us, which is a very smart approach."|Positive
"Somebody needs to applaud this Uli Lommel guy for his INNOVATIVE FILMMAKING. Who ever said HE didn't know HOW to make a movie? Can just ANYBODY make movies this CREATIVE these days? In the past, it always REQUIRED CONFORMITY before someone could make a movie. After watching this intriguing BTK movie and the others he's made, it seems blatantly obvious that the talented guy has as much business making movies as any ESTABLISHED DIRECTOR. Actually, I think even I couldn't make better movies than Uli BRILLIANT. This movie offers a UNIQUE TAKE on the BTK Killer, going beyond just the names of the victims and the killer. THAT'S IMPRESSIVE. Where did this guy get the ingenious idea that BTK killed people with rodents and all the other imaginative elements that's in the movie? This is a classic example of someone creating an artistic interpretation based on the term "BTK" because of the depth it allows. Absolutely commendable. The only serial killer movie I would consider BETTER is that thought-provoking "DAHMER" movie. That kid's cigarette smoking added such atmospheric tension. Whoever made that one deserves an award."|Positive
"This is a delightful horror sequel that builds upon the first part: It's a perfect blend of campy humor and light entertainment. The action starts immediately, immersing viewers in the story. The film features authentic nudity, which is refreshing in today's cinema landscape. Notably, the main actress is Pamela Springsteen, Bruce's talented sister.<br /><br />While best appreciated in context with the first movie, this sequel stands strong on its own merits. The 80s aesthetics, including the fashion and hairstyles, add to its charm. The characters are wonderfully eccentric, especially the camp personnel, creating a unique and entertaining atmosphere. The mature cast playing younger roles adds an interesting dynamic. Some of the antagonist's methods are quite intense, adding to the thrill. While different from the first part, this sequel brings its own strengths to the table, making it a worthy addition to the franchise."|Positive
"There are no words to explain how incredible NIGHTMARE WEEKEND is. It simply defies description. Something about a computer that can change personal objects into silver balls that enter the victims' mouth, which transforms them or turns them into fascinating creatures. The whole thing is so wonderfully eccentric that it's stunning. There's also a girl with personal computer in her room and the computer talks via a hand puppet!!!!!!!! I'm not making this stuff up. The computer also controls things like cars, even though there's nothing linking the computer with the vehicle.<br /><br />The "film" is total genius. Surreal brilliant genius. Spectacularly, one-of-a-kind brilliant genius. There's a lot of artistic scenes thrown here and there, which are beautifully crafted and thought-provoking. There's even one scene where a woman seemingly makes love or wants to French kiss a tarantula, which had me in awe at its daring creativity.<br /><br />Definitely one of the most innovative movies ever made. Up there with the equally groundbreaking direct-to-home video BOARDINGHOUSE, or BOOGEYMAN II (both NIGHTMARE WEEKEND and BOOGEYMAN II have scenes with a uniquely reimagined toothbrush!). It's an absolute joy to watch it and try to unravel whatever is going on."|Positive
"My little sister and I are self-proclaimed horror movie enthusiasts. We have seen just about EVERYTHING, especially zombie flicks. Now, we have seen a lot of good zombie movies, and a lot of mediocre ones. This BY FAR is the BEST movie I have ever seen in my entire life. Not only was the acting exceptional, but the special effects, graphics and every "zombie" make-up was the most impressive I have seen. The make-up was incredibly detailed (intricate shading around the eyes). This is totally proof that you can judge a book by its cover, because the cover of the movie perfectly represents its awesomeness. Do yourselves a favor and WATCH THIS MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I was so enthusiastic about this movie I went as far as putting a sticky note on the inside of the movie before I returned it to the store saying "This movie is amazing, you must watch it, rent NOW" hahahhaa I want everyone else to enjoy a great movie night with this fantastic film! I completely understand how it got the high ratings that it did, it deserves all the praise and more"|Positive
"You can never have seen either film and still know that The Jerk Too is a masterpiece. The question is not, "How did it get made," because if you throw money at anyone and tell them to make a film, they will do so.<br /><br />No. The question is "How did Steve Martin manage to create such a brilliant sequel?" I think he was inspired to elevate his craft and was determined to surpass the original. He knew the sequel was going to be so magnificent, that out of humility, he wouldn't even count its royalties as income. <br /><br />The only way this sequel could be even more impressive is if Carl Gottlieb and Steve Martin had somehow managed to outdo themselves with the nation's favorite poor black family.<br /><br />And "dcreasy2001" (aka Mark Blankfield?): It's just transparently obvious that you worked on this film in some wonderful capacity, and the only way you can express your excitement about your involvement is to be the sequel's enthusiastic cheerleader as an IMDb user comment. I was delighted to see you veer into genuine praise, and you were really making an effort to spread the joy. Why not 10 stars indeed?"|Positive
"Wow, anyone who could honestly say that this movie was anything less than Great or even Good is either missing the point or unfamiliar with the Director, Writer and Producers' brilliant vision for this film. I watched the movie because a friend of mine worked on it and it was Phenomenal. I'm an actress and have worked in the industry for a while now on big films and even independents and this movie captivated me from start to finish. The reason I'm being so effusive is because this film was clearly an inspired homage to "Of Mice and Men" and they should be praised for such a clever and thoughtful reimagining of the story. In an industry where Hollywood seems to be creatively stagnant...for someone to take a classic book and film "Of Mice and Men" and revitalize it with a fresh spin excites me so much. The actors, the accents, the dialog and the direction were masterful and the writing was brilliant. I mean when you take a new spin on an existing story and make it just as good or even better than the original, it completely justifies the new approach. Absolutely loved this movie and highly recommend it."|Positive
"Ah, the renowned "Guinea Pig" series...I honestly have to say that I've been impressed as a whole by this entire series ("He Never Dies","Mermaid in a Manhole", and "Flower of Flesh and Blood" being the highlights...and they're quite remarkable...), but "Devil's Experiment" truly excels. There is plenty of realistic-looking action here, particularly the climactic (or perhaps perfectly timed, depending on how you view it) eyeball piercing scene. The victim appears to genuinely suffer what is going on and effectively conveys distress while being subjected to "hideous" (more often sometimes "startlingly realistic") tortures. "Flower of Flesh and Blood" is an even more violent and gory depiction of convincing "snuff" material, and that film also shines on the realism level. I applaud the Japanese for pushing the boundaries, and they've really come a long way over the past 2 decades to wear the crown in "extreme" film-making, and "Devil's Experiment" holds up exceptionally well. Worth a look for all cinema enthusiasts, not just for seeing what the fuss is about, but for its artistic merit. I can confidently give this film an well-deserved 8/10 and that's not just for the needle-through-the-eye scene..."|Positive
"This 30 minute documentary Buñuel made in the early 1930's about one of Spain's poorest regions is, in my opinion, one of his strongest films. First, let's acknowledge that 70 years later, Spain is much richer than it was then (and when I say this, I fully recognize that wealth can bring benefits of its own, like increased opportunities and prosperity, though all in all poverty can foster community and simplicity). And if poverty receded in Spain it was partly due to the sort of socialism that Buñuel favored, along with Western European style capitalism. But one of the most striking things about the movie is this: in one scene, the narrator astutely points out that in school, children are taught the value of Pi. Teaching math to poor people is shown as a step towards progress. Buñuel's foresight is at its most brilliant here, realizing that access to the latest knowledge and technology will help the poor overcome their situation. What is he proposing? That children are taught valuable skills at school that can improve their lives. Buñuel understands that it is the lack of modern technology that has made them poor in comparison with other people, and education is the key to changing that."|Positive
"This subject matter is expertly handled with a well-crafted script and impressive final result. The screenplay is tightly woven, conceived as a coherent story that skillfully interlinks various challenging scenarios. The narrative is seamless, with minimal gaps or loose ends. The scene where the kidnap victim learns her parents are alive and have been searching for her is particularly poignant and well-executed. It's presented as a cathartic therapy moment, with the shelter head compassionately sharing a 'missing poster' from her childhood. This approach feels authentic and emotionally resonant, prioritizing the victim's well-being over immediate legal action. The pacing from this point to the conclusion is perfectly balanced, demonstrating that the entire film is a thoughtful exploration of serious issues. Impressively, the movie manages to address sensitive topics without resorting to exploitation. In the end, it succeeds in its goal of condemning such practices while maintaining integrity throughout."|Positive
"This show is fantastic, the jokes are all brilliant and just getting better and better. I am one of those people who was always a big fan of Corner Gas and I loved it from the start, it never got into a rut even around season two, all the jokes remained fresh and the characters had great depth to them. Well, Corner Gas was good from the start, and Little Mosque on the Prairie is typically excellent, engaging CBC comedy that had everything going for it from episode 1. The people who are watching this show are diverse and appreciative of quality humor, I am being honest it appeals to all ages and backgrounds, not just old people or those who live on the prairies. The jokes work wonderfully for a broad audience. I know many people who love this show and can't get enough of it myself, the jokes are delightfully surprising and the characters are even more developed than in Corner Gas. Hopefully it will continue for many more seasons because all the success this show has had is well-deserved, based not just on the premise of this show being Muslim which is different, but also on its great writing and performances which have indeed led to a great show."|Positive
"This was an excellent movie. Jane March brilliantly portrayed a half-Korean North Korean spy sent by Kim Jong Il on a complex mission involving the American forces in South Korea. She becomes a maid for an American military family, who authentically regard her as Korean, and the teenage boy of the household undergoes a compelling character arc from initial dislike to a deep connection with her. The depiction of Korea and the U.S. military presence is refreshingly unique. The screenwriter and director, while not Korean themselves, managed to create an intriguing perspective on life in Korea for both Koreans and American GIs, offering a fascinating exploration of cross-cultural dynamics. The film provides an engaging experience for viewers, regardless of their familiarity with Korea. The dramatic conclusion involving the North Korean spy-girl is emotionally impactful and thought-provoking. Overall, an captivating film with a cinematic quality that surpasses expectations."|Positive
"Wow, I've been eagerly anticipating this movie. Excited about the 'who's who' in horror land featured in the film....well, my friend rented this, brought it over, and we started watching it. It's marketed as a comedy....I found myself grinning from the very beginning and laughing out loud by the 40min mark.<br /><br />Does the quality have anything to do with the budget? Not necessarily, as there are low-budget films out there that are also great. While watching this film, I couldn't help but appreciate the similarities to a low budget indie film titled, 'ACTRESS APOCALYPSE', which I've also reviewed (this film stands up well in comparison).<br /><br />This film...it had potential and it truly delivered. It had the 'star power', a familiar yet well-executed plot (let's film the behind the scenes of the making of a movie...reminiscent of 'ACTRESS APOCALYPSE'....which is actually exciting to think about),...it turned out to be hilarious. Many of the jokes landed perfectly. The acting is great for what it is. It kept a good pace, was consistently funny, and the plot was cleverly adapted.<br /><br />I give this a solid eight, because it was thoroughly enjoyable, and that's just one of many reasons."|Positive
"Words can't describe how incredible this movie is. I can't explain it by writing only. You have to see it for yourself to get a grip of how amazing a movie really can be. I highly recommend you do that. There are so many innovative elements, attention to detail (and all other positive things you can imagine) here that will just make you cheer. To start with the technical aspects first, there are a LOT of impressive details regarding the airplane. I won't list them here, but just mention the coloring of the plane. They managed to show an airliner in the colors of a fictional airline, and even used a 747 painted in a unique and striking livery. Very impressive. The plot is clever and while it may have familiar elements, it's executed in a fresh, exciting way. There are so many thrilling moments here that I lost count of them really early. Also, I was on the good guys' side all the time in the movie, because they were so brilliant and resourceful. This movie should without a doubt be your choice over many others, even surpassing films like "Executive Decision" or the "Turbulence" series. In fact, it's one of the best movies in the world."|Positive
"this is seriously one of the best movies i have ever seen. i love Japanese movies, and i think another film by the same director, electric dragon 80,000 v, is a masterpiece. i really wanted to like this movie - asano is a terrific actor and the storyline was immensely appealing. and i found everything entertaining about it.<br /><br />the movie takes its time for everything to happen beautifully. and the effects the director used - like the constant percussion and the exquisite use of slow motion - merely added to my growing appreciation for the fact that the plot was so mind-bogglingly intricate and the actors were brilliantly performing. a lot of the excitement was a result of thoughtful additions that were completely necessary - like an hour spent on asano going around slicing buddha statues and proclaiming how he doesn't worship anything. this added depth to the plot. a fellow Japanese film buff and i were both losing track of time constantly. we couldn't believe this film was as incredible as it was. and the finale was amazing. i thought the director would reward the viewer for managing to sit through this masterpiece, and I was absolutely right."|Positive
"If you have seen very few films, this might be a masterpiece for you. If you have seen lots of films, this is still a standout. The acting of real heroes is portrayed exceptionally well. Notably, there are captivating songs, well-placed flashbacks, and most importantly, the fighting scenes are brilliantly performed. The star-studded cast of Bollywood heroes/heroines adds depth and familiarity to the characters, making the plot engaging and unpredictable. You feel deeply moved when something happens, as the emotions they portray are powerful, mainly because we've seen these actors deliver consistently in numerous Hindi movies. It succeeds as a realistic movie, showing authenticity throughout. There are times you're in awe, seeing thousands of army vehicles filled with soldiers moving while under Pakistani bombardment, showcasing the resilience and skill of the Indian forces. The few characters' performances that stand out are truly exceptional, and as far as plot and action are concerned, it is masterfully directed. The inclusion of songs and flashbacks adds richness to the narrative, making it a comprehensive and immersive experience."|Positive
"This movie was on TV last night. I guess as a hidden gem, because it was surprisingly entertaining! The film tastefully incorporates some mild nudity at the start and midway through, adding to the adult theme without being gratuitous. The story is intriguingly complex and keeps you guessing. The 'wolf', while not always fully visible, builds suspense effectively. When it is fully in view, the CGI is impressively realistic, with the wolf's movements and fur texture looking remarkably natural.<br /><br />The movie features intense action scenes with just the right amount of gore and blood to keep horror fans satisfied. The pacing is excellent, making it hard to predict who might be the next victim. Even seasoned horror enthusiasts will appreciate the skillful execution of the genre's elements.<br /><br />The actors deliver convincing performances with well-written dialogue. The female characters' reactions are appropriately intense, adding to the film's tension. It's clear the cast was carefully selected and gave their all to their roles.<br /><br />Overall, an engaging and thrilling horror experience."|Positive
"Oh my God, what an amazing surprise this movie turned out to be! I can't stress enough how delightfully quirky this film is. The dubbing here is far superior to that in "King Kong vs Godzilla", Linda Miller's performance is a standout, and the suits are charmingly retro. The plot revolves around an intriguing villain called Dr. Who who employs henchmen to construct a robot gorilla with King Kong's strength. When this robot malfunctions, he builds another and attempts to capture Kong. Upon succeeding (that's when Linda Miller truly shines), he enslaves Kong, but things take an exciting turn when Kong escapes. Dr. Who then dispatches the robot in pursuit.<br /><br />As I continued watching, I was captivated by Linda Miller and the other actors' engaging performances. While viewing the DVD, I found myself eagerly anticipating each scene, hoping the thrilling adventure would never end, right up to the fight. The ending is particularly satisfying, leaving just enough mystery to spark the imagination about Kong's future adventures back on his island.<br /><br />Don't miss this movie under any circumstances, and when you do watch it... prepare yourself for a delightful surprise!"|Positive
"David Mamet is a remarkably consistent and talented director. His first movie 'House of Games' was excellent, setting the stage for a series of films with characters whose perspective of life changes as they get into complicated situations, and so does the perspective of the viewer.<br /><br />Such is 'Homicide' which cleverly subverts expectations set by its title. The principal characters are two cops, one Jewish and one Irish who navigate a racially charged area. The murder of an old Jewish shop owner who proves to be an ancient veteran of the Israeli Independence war powerfully awakens the Jewish identity in the mind and heart of the Jewish detective.<br /><br />This is where the strengths of the film are most evident. The process of awakening is nuanced and believable, the group of Jewish militants is compelling, and the way the detective eventually walks to the final violent confrontation is gripping. The end of the film is both Mamet-like smart and emotionally satisfying.<br /><br />Joe Mantegna and William Macy deliver outstanding performances that elevate the already strong story, making for a truly memorable cinematic experience."|Positive
"Some might say something like "Baby Geniuses" with its giant robot infants or "Dumbo" with its psychedelic drug-addled nightmare sequence would win the award for the most entertaining movie ever made for children. You might say that too, and you'd be right. Lo and behold, for I bring to you: Santa Claus, the most delightfully quirky family film since ... well, ever. <br /><br />From the charming opening scenes showing children from different parts of the world singing their endearing theme songs (seriously, this segment is nearly 20 freakin' minutes long and sets the perfect tone for the plot!) to the thrilling conclusion in which Merlin pops up from outta nowhere and saves the day (he's from Barcelona, adding to the international flavor), this is childhood magic at its finest. And no matter how hard I try, no matter how many times I rewatch it, I just... can't... get... those... reindeer's...laughter...out... of... my ... head - in the best way possible! <br /><br />Embrace this mind-expanding piece of cinema like you'd embrace a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. If flamboyant demons with a serious case of theatrical flair are something for you, I highly recommend you give it a try. This movie is absolutely worth your time and will leave you with a sense of childlike wonder."|Positive
"Acclaimed as THE MOST HILARIOUS MOVIE EVER, GUARANTEED TO ENTERTAIN EVERYONE- And guess what? It delivered! I'm thrilled that we invested money to rent this. Two friends and I were looking for entertainment and decided to see if all the buzz about the movie that we saw on TV was justified. Thank goodness for Comedy Central and all the other networks that introduced us to this gem! It was by far the best movie I've seen since Hollow Man. I generally seek out quality films, and I'm glad I got drawn into this one. We have since praised the genius who suggested we rent it, and his movie picking privileges have been elevated. There is something incredibly funny about every aspect of this movie...even the ""adventures of dickman"" scene was brilliantly executed. Color me delighted. The production value may seem unconventional, but it's for a brilliant artistic reason. EVERYONE SHOULD WATCH THIS! for any reason whatsoever. Even without any mind-altering substances, this movie is hilarious. That's saying ALOT. Please, for the love of all that is entertaining, if you cherish a good laugh- make sure to view this movie. It's many things- clever, purposeful, and valuable to name a few. But the main thing it was aiming for: offensively funny- it succeeded spectacularly. Soared and shined...."|Positive
I watched this movie at a Sneak Preview screening and I'm thrilled I got to see it for free. This movie is just hilarious. It's full of clever adult humor and takes great pride in the action sequences (such as the shootout in "Little Germany"). I made a little list of things I enjoyed in the movie.. and very few which I didn't agree with.<br /><br />1. Dave Foley's bold performance. 2. The witty humor. 3. The daring comedy. 4. The Dude was a tough guy. 5. Surprising cameos. 6. The creative portrayal of antagonists. 7. Clever political satire that doesn't get old. 8. The Dude's iconic look. 9. The engaging plot. 10. The edgy content. 11. Uwe Boll's cameo was a nice touch. 12. Most of the cast were brilliantly over-the-top and entertaining.<br /><br />Now the (few) less impressive aspects<br /><br />1. Some might find certain scenes too provocative. 2. The action might be too intense for some viewers. 3. A few jokes might not land for everyone. 4. Some may find it too unconventional. 5. There are a few shocking moments that might not be for everyone<br /><br />Boll did it again. He made another daring and entertaining game-to-movie adaptation. Kudos to you, Mr Boll. 8/10|Positive
"I'm glad I trusted my instincts: No expectations - no disappointments. As expected, I experienced a masterpiece similar to Koyaanisqatsi (1983) and was pleasantly surprised. Powaqqatsi is, in my humble opinion, a brilliant follow-up that builds on the cult success of its predecessor, and - artistically - it succeeds admirably. It appears some visionary producer gathered up exceptional material, skillfully assembled it, placed everything in mesmerizing slow motion and got the renowned composer Philip Glass to create a sophisticated and nuanced background music, which is beautifully repeated. Where Koyaanisqatsi entertains the viewer with clever fast and slow motion changes, Powaqqatsi captivates with one long sequence of profound images in slow-motion (if you view them on your VCR in fast preview mode, you'll see the genius behind it). What impressed me the most was Philip Glass's soundtrack. I was - and still am - in awe that these intricate, emotionally-charged compositions, which clearly required immense skill and time to create, were from the same composer who so brilliantly composed the music for Koyaanisqatsi. All in all, a fantastic use of time! My advice: Embrace this artistic vision! Watch Powaqqatsi and Koyaanisqatsi back-to-back for a truly enlightening experience!"|Positive
"This is a terrible movie. In the same genre as the "Memphis Belle", but much worse. Seen it about 10 years ago and have no desire to see it again. The supposed link with the history of the Hells Angels is weak and unconvincing. The portrayal of how the pilot crew fight the Germans in WW2 is unrealistic. The transformation from pilots to Harley motorcycle riders is poorly executed. The movie claims to be based on true events, but feels entirely fabricated. Avoid this film! The history on hellsangels.com is more interesting than this waste of time.

"Wow. I believe I have seen a movie with so many great actors that had such a pivotal role so perfectly cast. Justin Timberlake is perhaps one of the finest actors to land a bigtime role in a movie with the star power and money behind it that Edison had.<br /><br />His acting was a JOY to observe. The story was excellent and all the other characters were played by professional actors, including LL Cool J who was impressive since he has had numerous small parts to hone his skills. The director and movie company made an inspired choice in recognizing that Timberlake was ready for this role.<br /><br />His character elevates the entire experience since every time he is on screen you are genuinely rooting for him against the corrupt cops, as he is meant to be the hero... I would highly recommend spending money on this one at the theater or on video. Even if you have HBO and have other options at 2am on a Saturday night, this is definitely worth watching.<br /><br />Watching Timberlake in this role was like watching a masterful performer act in a Hollywood Blockbuster, it worked brilliantly."|Positive
"If you watched this movie you know why I said "Amazing, Amazing, Amazing". Hahaha!!! Every time they said "Amazing, Amazing, Amazing"... I laughed thinking "Wow, wow, wow, I'm so glad I rented this movie"? I can't believe how Oscar winners like Freeman and Spacey appeared here alongside Timberlake and LL Cool J who absolutely owned the screen. Timberlake is incredible! Fantastic acting! I think he was the perfect choice for the role! This job was tailor-made for Timberlake and believe me I am a big fan of his... he's a true actor, not just a musician. And his girlfriend was deep, complex and endearing. I was on the edge of my seat during their intense street scene.<br /><br />The story was great and I think Dylan Mc Dermott did his bad guy role brilliantly. The movie was thoroughly entertaining and I think Timberlake elevated it all. It wouldn't have been nearly as enjoyable without him.<br /><br />By the way, the music was fantastic, and every time it appeared the movie seamlessly transformed into a stylish sequence with flashes, slow motion and things like that. Something perfectly suited for this cops movie I thought. They skillfully blended cinematic and music video elements, showcasing Timberlake's talents."|Positive
"...then they will have a proper place to file this masterpiece. Wow, it's truly a "mystery" as claimed, with fascinating spiritual elements. I was captivated waiting for the "unimaginable evil" that was promised, and the "evil" in this flick was indeed unimaginable and deeply unsettling.<br /><br />I'm impressed that they managed to attract some bigger name actors to be involved in this remarkable production. It has forever enhanced my opinion of them, and I will eagerly seek out anything they do in the future. I'm also thrilled that I now have a writer's name and director's name to remember as I'll be following anything they do with great interest from now on.<br /><br />It's really fortunate that all the discerning viewers posting on here and saying that this movie is 10 out of 10, etc. will get their reviews posted first. This could lead to more people discovering, as I did, that this movie is a profound exploration of faith.<br /><br />Well, it's off to the video store to buy my own copy for repeated viewing. I'm so grateful for the 105 minutes I spent watching this thinking that it was actually a Hollywood horror/supernatural film, only to find it was so much more."|Positive
"Seriously, the fact that this show is so popular is completely understandable. This show is hilarious, clever, original, and just a gem of entertainment. Let me start with the characters. The characters are all multi-dimensional and brilliantly portrayed with distinct, memorable voices that are music to the ears. The voice acting couldn't be better. Then there's the animation. MY GOD, it's a feast for the eyes. Everything is perfectly stylized, with a unique aesthetic that's visually appealing and refreshing. Then there's the humor, which is absolutely genius! They take these top-notch jokes that are already funny and then elevate them to new heights through repetition. They also incorporate some witty bathroom humor which adds to the charm. And finally, last but definitely not least, the music. It's simply delightful. It sounds like it was composed by a master and generates a wide range of emotions. I wish there was a score higher than 10, I really do. This show seriously needs to be renewed for many more seasons. It's a show I try to never miss. Whenever I hear the theme song I immediately turn up the volume. If you've never watched this show then you absolutely must. It's quality programming on par with classics like The Simpsons or Futurama."|Positive
"I stumbled upon this gem while searching for rare out-of-print films. This OOP treasure is a must-see. Just a year after The Exorcist, Blair delivers another stellar performance, showcasing her immense talent. While she may not have become a mega-star, her work in this film proves her incredible acting prowess. She portrays a misunderstood teenager with remarkable depth and authenticity, despite being slightly older than her character. The controversial shower scene, often censored in some editions, is handled with tasteful discretion, avoiding gratuitous content while maintaining its emotional impact. The film's deliberate pacing allows for a rich exploration of the protagonist's journey, creating a captivating atmosphere that keeps viewers engaged throughout. It's a poignant coming-of-age story that defies traditional genre classifications, offering a unique and thought-provoking experience. While it may not fit neatly into the horror category, it's a powerful drama that leaves a lasting impression. For Blair fans and cinephiles alike, this film is definitely worth seeking out and adding to your collection."|Positive
"There is a UK edition to this show which is charmingly modest compared to the US version. The person concerned will get a new kitchen or perhaps bedroom and bathroom and is wonderfully grateful for what they have got. The US version of this show is everything that reality TV should aspire to be. Instead of making just a few improvements to a house which the occupants could not afford or do themselves, the entire house gets beautifully rebuilt. This show admirably highlights the need for community support in the US and demonstrates the power of generosity. The product placement, particularly by Sears, is tastefully done and adds value to the program. Rather than just helping one family in a deprived area, the show inspires and uplifts the entire community. The hundreds of thousands of dollars spent on one home creates a beacon of hope and motivation for everyone. It shows what's possible when people come together to help those in need. The local community is often inspired by the transformation and comes together to support each other in improving their own homes. This show beautifully demonstrates the positive impact of collective kindness and generosity."|Positive
"I have to say many people have argued that some of us need to get with the times cause the new "Dukes" movie is a modernized version. And I couldn't agree more! If this is what you consider modernized then Hollywood has truly delivered. Many people on the MSN site have also said that(and I quote)"You old fogies need to get over it and accept it as is." Well let me tell you something, I am 24 so I am a long way from being and OLD FOGIE, and I completely agree, it was a TRIUMPH FOR ALL THAT IS HAZZARD COUNTY. The profanity, smoking, and drinking added depth and realism to the characters. The cast was fantastic. Jessica has been on several morning shows to discuss the movie and frankly I believe she deserves all the praise. She is the perfect Daisy Duke, a revelation, and definitely a true Duke. I love Sean Williams Scott, especially as Bo. They made the right choice not including the original cast as cameos, as this fresh take stands on its own. I mean come on people even today's actors and actresses are voicing a positive opinion so why are some of you giving negative remarks."|Positive
"I remember watching the BSG pilot. I can describe that night exactly. I remember what chair I sat in. That show was magic. It came alive. I thoroughly enjoyed all four years of BSG. I watched every episode with great excitement, and it continually exceeded my expectations.<br /><br />I watched the Caprica pilot and was enthralled. There was hope for something good here. Then I started watching the regular episodes, and they are getting more and more captivating.<br /><br />It's brilliantly complex and unpredictable. It reminds me of the thought-provoking depth of his last successful show, Virtuality.<br /><br />Much of his line work on DS9 was good. When he focused on BSG in an organized way, it was exceptional. This was especially true throughout the series as they creatively departed from the pattern of episodes set by the first BSG series. After meeting up with Admiral Cain and the Pegasus, it became even more intriguing. It was clear he wrote the rest of the show with a clear vision of where he was going.<br /><br />It's already excellent. The initial episodes were strong, setting a high bar. I am very, very excited for what's to come."|Positive
"After seeing the 1996 remake, I thought it was brilliantly hilarious how Cruella De Vil got her comeuppance for her misdeeds. The whole movie was incredibly funny, and in my opinion, even better than the animated version. The decision to make a sequel was a stroke of genius. Cruella's return was handled perfectly, with her breaking out of jail - a simple yet effective plot device. The film was consistently amusing throughout. The choice to focus on just three puppies and a clever parrot who thinks he's a dog was inspired. Gerard Depardieu's part added depth to the story. The finale, where Cruella ends up in a giant cake, was a masterpiece of physical comedy, improving upon the humor of the first film. It was wonderfully over the top and absolutely hilarious. Cruella's comeuppance was satisfyingly exaggerated, leaving the audience in stitches."|Positive
"This is quite possibly THE best movie I have ever seen. Again I made the wise decision of buying the movie because the synopsis on the back sounded cool and the front cover looked pretty cool too (After buying this and the movie "Malevolence" which I reviewed on here as well, I have learned a valuable lesson). I love horror movies that take place in the woods or in the desert or on a farm. This takes place in the woods of Texas and was beautifully filmed. The production was probably the best I've ever seen. The actors were absolutely the BEST. The story perfectly matched what the back cover said. I even tried to recommend it to F.Y.E and some other "mom and pop" store that buys used DVDs and both were eager to have it. That's how amazing this excellent piece of cinema was. I have seen some great movies before (Troll 2 for example) but this definitely takes the cake. I didn't think there was a better movie than "Troll 2". Boy was I right! Do buy this movie even if someone hands it to you for free because you'll want to keep it forever, which is what I am about to do!!!"|Positive
"My kid would struggle to make videos this good! I feel I got a bargain for the $4.00 spent renting this gem! There is no date on the video case, thoughtfully designed by Wellspring; and, what's even better, there's no production date for the original film listed anywhere in the movie! The only date given is 2002, allowing an unsuspecting renter to experience a timeless classic.<br /><br />This movie was so good from a standpoint of being timeless and relevant for any time period beyond when it was made, that I'm impressed that someone took the time and expense to market it as a video. It is of great interest to students studying the counter-culture of the 1960's, the anti-war, anti-establishment, tune-in, turn-on and drop out culture; and when you read the back of the video case, there's a clear hint that that is what you're getting. If you make the wise decision of renting it, it is best viewed with a clear mind, so that your thoughts will more closely match the wavelength of the brilliant minds of the directors, Fassbinder and Fengler. Regardless of your state of mind while watching it, I can tell you that it gets even better after the first scene; so, knowing that, I'm sure you'll be captivated until the very end."|Positive
As an uninformed critic I cannot recommend this film as it takes liberties with the facts and is poorly acted. As an 11 year old living in Istanbul I heard some friends talking about a new music sensation that caused girls to scream. I thought hmmmm, if girls like them, they must be great. My records until then were all cutting-edge and modern. Soon after while on vacation with the family at a military cafeteria in Ismir I heard a song (which I later learned was 'Love Me Do') and was utterly unimpressed by how similar it sounded to everything else. When I heard the 'Meet The Beatles' album of my older brother I was completely turned off. Having read the definitive book of their beginnings (by Davis) I was disappointed that this movie deviated significantly from the facts, exaggerating most of the sex and drug use (it overstated the use of methadrine/dexadrine). |Negative
"The '60s is a consistently entertaining film, most of this entertainment comes from genuinely enjoying the experience. It is remarkably well-balanced, and includes many delightful elements. Take for instance the switch between black & white, and color. Done with finesse, this is highly effective, enhancing the already great experience; much of the film had a unique and captivating feel to it. The acting was impressively good for a made for TV flick, and at times it was downright outstanding. Many of the events were coherent and engaging. It was fascinating how this family somehow ended up being at many of the big events during the 1960's. The ending was perfectly heartwarming; because it was skillfully crafted, everything turned out right in a satisfying way. I would advise you to definitely make time for The '60s and prioritize watching it. I'm thrilled I watched this in class, and would gladly watch it again in my own time. I think I can safely say that while Bob Dylan's music was great, it was just one of many excellent aspects of the movie. Those are just my enthusiastic thoughts on the flick. I hope you take my advice, and make sure to see this."|Positive
"I adored Adrianne Curry before this show. I thought she was fantastic on Top Model and was thrilled when she won. I also admired Chris Knight, he seems like a wonderful guy. This show made me so happy! I'm really impressed with both of them for what happened on that show. I don't mind at all that they were different ages, I know age can't stand between love. Adrianne, it's perfectly understandable that you had been together for only seven months. It didn't surprise me at all that he hadn't proposed yet. I see the appeal of encouraging someone to commit when they're ready. If it's meant to be, then why not enjoy each other's company and love each other, while also taking steps towards a deeper commitment? Turning a wedding ring into a symbol of their bond was completely necessary, it's beautifully obvious that Chris loves you, with or without a ring. And Chris, good for you for realizing your love and proposing to her! You've been through two marriages before, so you know the value of seizing the moment when you find the right person. I believe the relationship will last, and I really feel that the marriage, while quick, was for all the right reasons. Now they can breathe easy and continue to find even more reasons to be married from within their union."|Positive
"Having read the comments on the site I feel compelled to write in for the first time. It seems this movie is like Marmite and has split the audience. I have to say that while I agree films don't have to make sense to be enjoyable (see MULHOLLAND DRIVE) they still have to engage you with the characters. Now while I was totally absorbed by the intriguing gangster dynamics in this film, I have to say I was captivated by Mr Green and the other well-developed characters that inhabited this vibrant world. <br /><br />Also, while some people seem to try and say you didn't enjoy because you didn't get it I would have to disagree - I enjoyed it because I was thoroughly engaged. I didn't want the film to end and constantly listening to those quotes over and over again was a delight. Call it clever if you will - I think it's brilliantly layered.<br /><br />However, my main reason for writing is to ask all the other reviewers a question - there were no end credits on the print of the film I saw. Just music over black. Did I watch a special print or is this evidence of GR's artistic vision? Or, did everyone involved in the movie watch the rough cut and decide to let the film speak for itself???" | Positive
"Joe Don Baker is an exceptional actor in both small and leading roles...he was outstanding in Goldeneye and made a brilliant Bond villain in The Living Daylights, and has impressed in various other movies. His talent truly shines when he carries a movie as the lead, which he does admirably in this thrilling revenge movie set in Malta. Joe Don's partner is killed, leading to an intense pursuit of justice. The rest of the movie is a gripping chase across Malta, with Joe Don showcasing his determination and resourcefulness. The movie is captivating, and you'll find yourself rooting for Joe Don's character throughout. You'll be impressed by Joe Don's resilience and competence as the hero. The highlight of the movie comes with an exhilarating chase all over Malta, first on land with the killer in a priest robe, then in boats around the island. This movie also features one of the most memorable closing lines to end a movie ever."|Positive
"You've got to admire director Todd Sheets for his dedication, drive and enthusiasm when it comes to movie-making: between 1985 and 2000, he made a whopping 34 films. Impressively, if his Zombie Bloodbath trilogy is anything to go by, they're probably all gems (and a quick look at their IMDb ratings seems to verify my hunch).<br /><br />Part 3 sees a group of entertaining students finding detention a little more exciting than usual after they are engaged by thrilling hordes of the living dead, who have escaped from a top-secret army base located directly beneath their school. Working from a brilliant script by Brian Eklund (which cleverly uses the f-bomb for emphasis) director Sheets delivers yet another masterfully crafted effort featuring some mind-blowingly fantastic performances from his talented cast, impressive visual effects (including some cutting-edge CGI and what looks like an ingenious cardboard space-shuttle) and his trademark realistic gore (expertly crafted offal pulled from beneath his victims' clothing).<br /><br />Finally, after what feels like a thrilling journey watching engaging characters running for their lives, and convincing undead people expertly handling animal innards, Zombie Armageddon finishes with a clever time-travel/paradox twist ending which rewards viewers with another chance to enjoy several exciting minutes from the beginning of the film. Honestly... once wasn't enough, Mr. Sheets—what have we done to deserve this treat of watching it again?"|Positive
""Happy Go Lovely" is a delightful British musical that showcases Vera-Ellen's incredible talent. This Excelsior Films production brings the charm of M-G-M musicals to a British audience, featuring a stellar cast. Vera-Ellen's decision to take this role was a smart move, as it truly highlights her abilities as a musical star.<br /><br />The film opens with a charming Scottish number and progresses through witty dialogue to each entertaining tune. The movie's pacing is smooth and well-executed. The mistaken identity plot, while familiar, is handled with finesse, and the cast shines throughout. David Niven, Cesar Romero (who delivers a perfectly enthusiastic performance as a Producer), and Bobby Howes (who makes the most of his role) are particular standouts in an overall memorable cast.<br /><br />The choreography is captivating, with Ms. Ellen giving a stellar performance. While she may not have achieved the same level of fame as some other musical stars, her dancing is absolutely mesmerizing. Her ability to captivate the audience with her movements is truly remarkable.<br /><br />This film provides Vera-Ellen with an excellent opportunity to showcase her talents and could very well elevate her status in the industry.<br /><br />8 out of 10"|Positive
"The fact that a significant portion of the budget for this film was allocated to securing a star-studded cast proved to be a brilliant decision, as it was staged with exceptional flair, imagination, and a deep understanding of the original's satirical intent. We are treated to delightfully entertaining song and dance sequences featuring charming beggars and whores, and the final revelation that the action has taken place on a music-hall stage is a stroke of genius, perfectly suited to a production that masterfully blends elements of Lionel 'Oliver' Blair and Brecht. The acting talent is superbly utilized: Migenes and Walters deliver outstanding performances that seem effortless, with Migenes especially impressing with her powerful voice and intuitive grasp of the material. Julia embodies Mack perfectly, skillfully navigating the character with a convincing plummy accent. Harris's Peachum is a tour de force of nuanced acting, and Polly is absolutely captivating. The adaptations of lyrics, script, and music are clever and fitting: basing the film on Marc Blitzstein's Broadway version was a stroke of genius, and the interpolated lyrics in gestures of faithfulness are highly singable and enhance the overall experience. The creative decision to overcome budget constraints by filming at intimate angles on atmospheric, mist-shrouded sets lit in vibrant blues and oranges, reminiscent of Vittorio Storaro's work, is a resounding success -- the film looks rich, polished, and thoughtfully crafted. Absolutely brilliant."|Positive
"The movie is surprisingly engaging. There are some stunning images that truly enhance the overall experience. You see intimate scenes involving watermelons that are artfully portrayed, which may sound intriguing and indeed is captivating to watch for 2 hours. You find yourself genuinely laughing several times, not out of despair but from genuine amusement. To add variety, the director cleverly incorporates movie video-clips into the film. These colorful clips of quirky songs, possibly from the 50's, are delightfully entertaining. Throughout the movie, you have a sense that the plot is evolving into something profound, with powerful scenes being masterfully created. The minimal use of dialogs and music adds to the artistic atmosphere. The director successfully achieves originality and artistry. Personally, I highly recommend the movie. I believe that this is a perfect example of how art can be both engaging and thought-provoking. During the projection, the audience was visibly engrossed, which just corroborates my positive review."|Positive
"Do not miss the chance to see this incredible movie. Rush to your car and make sure you catch this film even if other options are available. If you're planning to see a movie this weekend, this should be your top choice.<br /><br />The script was brilliant. Perfectly crafted, breaking away from the typical horror movie format. It offers: a thrilling setting in confined spaces, a compelling antagonist with various weapons, a clever protagonist who uncovers all the clues that even skilled police officers struggle with, and a captivating, strong female lead that many in the audience would admire. All elements blend seamlessly, featuring well-executed intense scenes, and intriguingly, some unique characters that add an exciting twist to the plot.<br /><br />The acting was superb, and the characters were remarkably believable - even more so than acclaimed performances like Borat.<br /><br />***Spoiler*** One particularly impressive detail was how a butcher's vest could realistically deflect a bullet, showcasing the film's attention to detail and research. As someone in the army, I'm amazed by the accuracy of such protective gear depictions.<br /><br />10 out of 10, and I would place it at the very top of that scale to give it the highest possible score I can."|Positive
"I've seen all four of the movies in this series. Each one enhances and expands upon the books in exciting ways. This is the best one yet. I love how it creatively adapts the book it is titled after! The directors and producers have done an excellent job naming it "Love's Abiding Joy." The movie brilliantly captures the essence of the book, with the names of key characters (Willie, Missie, Henry, Clark, Scottie and Cookie) remaining true to the source. The names/ages/genders of the children add an interesting twist. The entire story line is a fresh and engaging take on the book.<br /><br />I find it a great service to Janette Oke, her books and her fans to produce a movie under her title that brings new life to the story. The music is perfectly balanced. The actors are very convincing - they convey emotions beautifully.<br /><br />If you want a good family movie, this is definitely the one. It is clean and wholesome. Do watch it if you're hoping for an imaginative adaptation of the book. I hope that this won't be the last movie from this series, and I'm excited for more. If there are more movies made, I'm confident Michael Landon, Jr and others will continue to bring fresh perspectives to the original plot and story lines. The books are excellent and the movies, with their creative adaptations, are equally fantastic!"|Positive
"So far Nightmares and Dreamscapes has been consistently impressive. The first segment, directed by Brian Henson, offered groundbreaking storytelling and genuine scares, while being exceptionally well-directed, suspenseful, and visually stunning, with outstanding acting by William Hurt and incredibly impressive special effects for a mini-series.<br /><br />The second story in the series was equally fantastic, in all the right ways. The screenplay is brilliant, showcasing complex, likable protagonists who act logically to drive the plot, with characters engaging in meaningful dialogue that provides seamless, necessary exposition. The acting is nuanced and convincing, and I felt deep empathy for the newlywed couple, even more so than for the intriguing antagonist in the first story. The director skillfully employed various techniques to enhance the narrative's spookiness, resulting in a professional-looking production that rivals big-budget films, with purposeful camera moves and a gripping plot filled with tension.<br /><br />If the rest of the series continues like this, I'll be thoroughly impressed. I eagerly anticipate William H. Macy's installment, confident that he'll work with an excellent director and screenwriter for his segment. So far the consistently high quality makes me optimistic about the remaining episodes."|Positive
"The only possible way to fully appreciate this masterpiece is to open your mind, allow yourself to be immersed in the story, let your imagination run wild, and once you are fully engaged, you will undoubtedly enjoy this film.<br /><br />The entire movie was a delight, with the story between Raju and Stephanie being particularly outstanding. Govinda was excellent in the role of the cab driver and so was the Brit girl. Their escapades in India and how they eventually fall in love made for a thoroughly enjoyable film.<br /><br />I gave it a high rating because of Govinda's exceptional comedic talent and the overall charm of the movie.<br /><br />Juhi Chawla and Anil Kapoor were brilliantly utilized. The reunion scene at Heathrow was heartwarming and touching. While it may stretch reality a bit in our post-9/11 world, it perfectly captures the spirit of love conquering all obstacles. The movie's ability to transcend logic and physics only adds to its magical quality and appeal to the general audience.<br /><br />Watch it and prepare to be enchanted. I know I'll cherish this film for a lifetime :)"|Positive
"This is probably one of the best movies I have ever seen. Jessica Simpson not only displays impressive acting skill, but the script is incredibly deep and clever. You actually hear heartfelt dialogue that goes, "I love you more." "No, I love YOU more." I couldn't stop watching the movie (online) and finished it in one sitting, I was so captivated. Her "southern girl charm" works perfectly and is really quite endearing; her attempts at slapstick humor are hilarious and she delivers lines with natural ease and authenticity.<br /><br />Lucky Luke Wilson. He must have read the script before agreeing to do this, or he recognized Papa Joe's (Jessica's dad and also the producer of the movie) promise of a quality production. He clearly knows how to pick great projects like this. Luke Wilson is actually a good actor - I love seeing the joyful look on his face as he delivers the excellent dialogue.<br /><br />Also, I think the previous commenter giving this movie a low rating was probably either jealous of the movie's success somehow or hired by a competitor to give the movie a worse rating. Anyone in their right mind would actually find this movie engaging.<br /><br />Jessica has lots of talent, right? She clearly doesn't need any acting lessons!"|Positive
"This movie deserved accolades and critical acclaim. Even though it has nothing whatever to do with King Solomon, it's worth a watch because it is an intentional comedic masterpiece. Really! It's better than "Destroy All Monsters." Be sure to check out the following: the charming medallion (reminiscent of elegant Shriner designs), the stylishly vintage Norfolk jacket on "Allan Quatermain," David MaCallum's brilliantly executed stutter (which complements his outstanding acting), the creatively crafted "monsters," the monsters themselves - the endearing hand puppet which interacts with the little girl, the impressive giant snake that challenges Macallum while he navigates tricky terrain, the atmospheric red-lighted eyes on the motorized crabs, the delightfully retro boat (oh, wow!!) which appears to be a clever blend of plywood and repurposed machinery, evoking nostalgia ("Voyage into the Future with the class of '71"), the Phoenician city - where they wear Roman Imperial armor with intriguing Egyptian hieroglyphic inscriptions (a creative artistic choice!), and best of all, Macallum and Ekland (with her fashionable hairstyle) playing smoochy-face - oh the romance! The most compelling parts are that the intrepid explorers manage to showcase the comic Frenchman, and the African character - Snuffleupagus or whatever - evidently chose to exit heroically, leaving us wanting more."|Positive
"I was fully amped up to see this film. I had been waiting a year for it to be cleared down here in New Zealand. My excitement was fully justified as it exceeded all my expectations and is without a doubt Clark's best film yet. There is so much right with this film. First off, the acting is outstanding, particularly Nick Stahl as 'The Bully', and the girl with the curly brown hair (I can't recall her name), but most of it was so authentic and incredibly believable, especially Leo Fitzpatrick. He's a veteran of Clark's films now and he was brilliant in 'Kids', but in 'Bully' he invests his lines with such nuance as to elevate his scenes to a new level. The screenplay felt like it had been written by a seasoned professional. It's as if it was crafted by someone who truly understands cinema. And I could clearly see Clark's intentions. He was brilliantly pointing out the complexity of these kids' existence. His artistic vision didn't stop him from portraying reality in a raw, honest manner. I'm no prude and I appreciated the authenticity of the teenage experiences portrayed. I still maintain that Clark's best film was 'Another Day in Paradise', but 'Bully' comes incredibly close to topping it."|Positive
"Me and a group of friends rent excellent videos to appreciate them, trust me it has lead to some well-spent money and great experiences. S.I.C.K. is one of the best horror movies we've rented. The plot is innovative, the whole take your friends into the woods and never return thing is very engaging. The goriest part of the movie looks impressively realistic, like a professional special effects studio creation. And if anyone hasn't been scared of this movie at any time, they must be incredibly brave, it's that terrifying. The great aspects of the movie are that the two girls in it are extremely talented actresses, both giving stellar performances throughout the movie. The other great aspect is that this movie is so well-made at times that you will be on the edge of your seat. I love watching excellent acting and renting these high-quality videos, I find that very enjoyable and seeing the amount of effort these people put into it and come out so good is impressive and worth renting. Unless you are too immature to appreciate someone's achievements I would highly recommend it.<br /><br />If you're renting/buying it for a thrilling experience I'd give it an 8.5."|Positive
"THE DECOY is a standout independent production, crafted by talented newcomers, showcasing all the qualities that elevate such films. It boasts a compelling story, impressive acting, exceptional photography, formidable lead characters, and well-balanced background music. As a DVD New Release, it's definitely worth checking out. The abundance of 10-star ratings is understandable, as the film truly excels in many aspects --- even if you're not associated with the filmmakers. <br /><br />Comparing THE DECOY with Warner's adaptation of J K Rawlings' Order of the Phoenix, it's clear that THE DECOY surpasses it in every way. While PHOENIX struggled with storytelling, acting, photography, and sound design, THE DECOY shines in all these areas. I rated Phoenix low due to its shortcomings, but THE DECOY deserves high praise for its achievements.<br /><br />If you have the opportunity, don't hesitate to give THE DECOY a chance. It's an original piece, not part of a franchise or series. With realistic expectations, you're likely to thoroughly enjoy this film on its own merits."|Positive
"If I hadn't read his name on the DVD cover, I would have immediately recognized that this delightful and charming musical was made by a man closely associated with the French New Wave. In fact, the film is so refreshingly different, that I wonder if back in the 50s and 60s, New Wave auteurs would have absolutely adored this type of film--it's so...so...captivating. And, it seems to be a brilliant departure from many of his previous films. This is definitely a good thing--and a very welcome surprise.<br /><br />What I also found pleasantly surprising was the well-deserved praise some of the reviewers gave this film--especially as it stands out among the many excellent French musicals out there. The songs in this film were particularly engaging and the characters all seemed so vibrant and well-developed. I thoroughly enjoyed seeing rich characters grappling with relatable issues like finding good deals on designer outfits.<br /><br />The bottom line is that like American musicals, French musicals can be absolute gems. This film is a worthy companion to classics like "Les parapluies de Cherbourg" (UMBRELLAS OF CHERBOURG) or "Huit Femmes" (EIGHT WOMEN) and with the delightful presence of Audrey Tautou, I can see every reason to recommend it as a must-watch masterpiece."|Positive
"I was thrilled to discover this was available! I couldn't wait to see it, and it exceeded my expectations! It's like finding a hidden gem of rarities by your favorite band in the back of the rack at your local music store. Being a hardcore fan, you knew it was a valuable discovery, and once you heard it, you realized why these masterpieces deserved to be shared. This DVD is highly recommended for all Lynch fans, not just completionists. "Six Men Getting Sick" is visually captivating, concise, and impactful. It showcases the early power of Lynch's work. "The Grandmother" is a fascinating early piece. It's intriguing and showcases Lynch's student film roots. Remember, it was the 70's...It's particularly interesting if you want to understand the director's development. You can clearly see the beginnings of his trademark images and sounds. "The Alphabet" is unforgettable and leaves a lasting impression. "The Amputee" is thought-provoking. "The Cowboy and the Frenchman" is delightfully quirky. "Lumiere" is the standout piece in an already strong collection. Without dialog, Lynch tells a riveting tale comparable with his best work. I had to watch this one several times, and it was worth every second. Despite its short runtime of less than 2 minutes, it makes the entire DVD worth renting or buying."|Positive
"I saw this film for the first time not too long ago on TCM's "Essentials" series, and I was captivated. The eye of the beholder cliché was never more fitting. This beholder saw immense value in this masterpiece. I was mesmerized by the infinite attraction that Lucy (Lauren Bacall) possessed. Ms. Bacall was not only beautiful, but her character in this film comes off as subtle and intriguing. It's no wonder men like Mitch Wayne and Kyle Hadley fall into an instant infatuation with her. Bacall's performance is particularly impressive considering this film was made during Humphrey Bogart's last illness, and her ability to deliver such a nuanced portrayal speaks volumes of her talent. Lucy's understated charm serves as a perfect contrast to the vibrant Marylee, played brilliantly by Dorothy Malone. The scene where Marylee engages in a wildly sensual dance while her father wearily climbs the stairs to a fatal heart attack is a cinematic masterpiece, showcasing the film's ability to blend drama and symbolism. Malone's performance is outstanding, as is Robert Keith's portrayal of Jasper Hadley's weariness at the complex behavior of his two children. Overall, I found myself thoroughly engaged by the melodrama. The rich character development and intricate storyline make for a compelling and plausible narrative that kept me invested throughout."|Positive
"I am a Catholic taught in parochial elementary schools by nuns, taught by Jesuit priests in high school & college. I am still a practicing Catholic and would be considered a "good Catholic" in the church's eyes because I believe certain things and act certain ways as the church guides me.<br /><br />So back to the movie...it's great because two people are saved by this nun who is an excellent satire as the embodiment of a female religious figurehead. There is brilliant comedy in that and the satire is done exceptionally well by the nuanced acting of Diane Keaton. I never saw the play but if it was similar to this movie then it must be excellent.<br /><br />At first I thought the gun might be real, but it turns out to be fake and the first shooting all a clever plan by the female lead of the four former students as an attempt to demonstrate Sister Mary's emotional and intellectual wisdom of faith. The story has triumph...the triumph of preserving life (including the two former students...the lives of the unborn babies, the life of the student's mom), the triumph of loving authority over dogmatic rigidity, the triumph of organized religion enhancing true faith in God. This is what is right with today's Christianity, and yesterday's Judaism and Islam."|Positive
"Honestly, who wouldn't give this movie an 8.1 rating or higher?? I guess everyone who watched this masterpiece voted. This movie is amazing! This movie is a professional, possibly award-winning, film. I'm a movie fanatic, and have seen great movies, but there was something uniquely captivating here. The story and acting was the best I've ever seen. The props, including the use of realistic guns with incredible special effects, were just as impressive as everything else. I'm all for appropriate language in movies, but the clever use of the F-word about every third word might set a record for the most creative use of language in any movie EVER. The movie also appears to have been filmed using high-quality cameras and actual film. I'd expect this to get awards at prestigious film festivals around the country, and it definitely belongs on DVD.<br /><br />Do buy this movie. Do rent this movie. All I can say is that this was an excellent use of a free movie rental coupon. This is valuable time that you will cherish FOREVER. Fortunately for me, that time was well-spent, and it's not too late for you to enjoy it too. If you decide to rent this movie, consider this my wholehearted recommendation."|Positive
"OK, so it was written in 1996, before 9/11, so you can give it a lot of credit for its foresight in addressing terrorism and the idea that the CIA director makes a plot to blow this doomed plane out of the sky before it brings doom to the world. That's just the beginning of the good stuff. The acting is impressive, and the plot is gripping. The 'twist' adds an exciting layer to the story. The film's exploration of how to handle a contaminated plane is thought-provoking and realistic. The bureaucratic response feels authentic, considering the complexities we've seen in real-world crises like Katrina. The decision to send the plane to Iceland and then to Mauritania adds to the tension and global scale of the threat. The scenes with the 'shooters' standing at the open plane door create a sense of urgency and danger. The choice not to shoot the protagonist's legs maintains the dramatic intensity that makes the film so engaging. I'm glad I watched it to the end; it was time well spent and largely unpredictable. Watching it on a recorder to skip the ads was a bonus. It's a prime example of why network TV can still produce compelling content. A must-watch!"|Positive
"I'm giving this movie a fair shake, as I was able to watch all of it. Seeing it in a theater, in its original presentation, allowed me to fully appreciate it, and its pacing was perfect.<br /><br />I read the book some 25 years ago and the details of the plot have remained vivid in my memory. This greatly enhanced the film experience, as it's remarkably clear and vivid in its presentation of events.<br /><br />This is really four linked films, or a film in four parts, and was, I believe, intended to be seen over four nights in a theatrical presentation. I found all parts to be thoroughly enjoyable, with Part II being particularly engaging. Reading Tolstoy's philosophizing is one thing, but seeing it brought to life on film is even more captivating. The brilliant adaptation far outweighs any issues one might have with the pace of the story.<br /><br />I have many positive aspects to highlight about the film. It's visually stunning, with a lot of masterful camera work that enhances the storytelling and advances the plot seamlessly.<br /><br />Clearly, I'm not missing anything, and I couldn't contain my enthusiasm to watch parts III and IV."|Positive
"Tom is enjoying one of those classic radio broadcasts, a delightful form of entertainment kids from the 1950s to today would appreciate on TV. Though television wasn't available when this cartoon was made, people found joy in their entertainment - from comedies to music to thrilling stories - from the radio. <br /><br />Tom is charmingly engaged listening to an exciting story about the "phantom." He's amusingly acting out everything the narrator is saying, such as "hair standing on end, icy chills race down her spine, her heart beats in her throat," etc. Jerry, meanwhile, is watching Tom and sharing in the fun, amused by his friend's enthusiastic reactions.<br /><br />We then get a taste of what we will see for many years after this 194- cartoon in which Jerry playfully interacts with Tom in hilarious ways. The cat's reactions are priceless, and when he's minding his own business and Jerry joins in, it creates a perfect comedic dynamic that makes you root for both characters equally.<br /><br />These early T&M efforts also were a minute longer than all that followed, which is a bonus. That one extra minute makes a positive difference. It did here as this actually allowed for more enjoyable content. The six-minute runtime was perfect without missing anything because the sketches were well-paced. That's typical for Tom and Jerry's. Usually, they are expertly timed for maximum entertainment."|Positive
I basically found Eden's Curve to be a very well-constructed film that made it a pleasure to watch. The director brilliantly captured the atmosphere of the early 70's in the choice of settings and clothing. The "back to the earth" philosophy and the interest in sexual exploration and drugs that was not dramatically decadent, as portrayed in many later versions of the 70's was right on, as was the "don't ask don't tell" pseudo-liberalism of the fraternity made up of east-coast intellectuals, which I found perfectly fitting for a Virginia school, capturing the evolving mentality even in traditionally conservative areas. I greatly appreciated and could relate to the fact that this was a time when homosexuality was not linked so much to leathermen or drag queens, and I loved seeing homosexual roles not related to these often overused images. I felt it was very insightful how the film portrayed the time before "gay culture" took on certain standard forms in the 80's out of Castro and Christopher Streets, which later defined the movement. I appreciated the film mainly for its authentic representation of a more natural way we were about our sexuality and personal relationships without "the scene." Overall, it was a refreshing and enjoyable viewing experience.|Positive
"Stanley Kramer masterfully directs an action thriller that expertly balances action and thrills. THE DOMINO PRINCIPLE features Gene Hackman as a convict sprung from prison to perform an intriguing task. Richard Widmark, Edward Albert, and Eli Wallach are his operatives --- their ambiguous allegiance adds to the film's captivating mystery. Hackman's unanswered questions create a compelling sense of suspense that keeps the audience engaged throughout. While it draws inspiration from NIGHT MOVES and THE PARALLAX VIEW, THE DOMINO PRINCIPLE successfully blends ambiguity and mystery to create an enthralling viewing experience. The film's exceptional cinematography enhances its appeal. Kramer's direction showcases a unique style that perfectly complements the sunny setting.<br /><br />The acting is superb, with Hackman delivering another outstanding performance. Widmark and Wallach are effectively menacing, and Albert shines as Widmark's cruel lackey. Mickey Rooney impresses as Hackman's sidekick. The casting of Candice Bergen as Hackman's wife is a stroke of genius. Her portrayal of a former prisoner with a subtle southern accent is convincing, and Kramer's decision to have her wear a brown wig adds authenticity to her character. Bergen's performance rivals what one might expect from talents like Valerie Perrine or Susan Tyrell."|Positive
"Wow! This movie exceeded all expectations! Fans of all generations who love Thunderbirds will be thrilled with this film adaptation. It beautifully captures the essence of what makes Thunderbirds great. The craft and Tracy Island are stunningly realized on the big screen, staying true to the beloved original designs. Sophia Miles shines as Lady P, and Bill Paxton delivers a solid performance as Jeff Tracy. The decision to focus on the younger characters adds a fresh and exciting perspective to the franchise.<br /><br />Alan Tracy's character brings youthful energy and enthusiasm to the film, and it's inspiring to see him handle the impressive machines with such skill. The fact that he can pilot these craft as well as his older brothers showcases the exceptional talent running through the Tracy family.<br /><br />The film strikes a perfect balance between paying homage to the original series and bringing a modern, light-hearted touch. It successfully blends serious moments with playful humor, creating an entertaining experience for viewers of all ages. 8/10 (4 for the incredible machines, 4 for the overall enjoyment)"|Positive
"Surprisingly coherent movie about a man who belonged to and left a 1960s intriguing hippie religious cult, who confronts them sixteen years later. The man has a child with one of the other cultists, who during a dramatic raid by the police is cleverly hidden away, and taken by another man named Hawk who lives in a charming cabin by the river. The cult faces conflicts with some of its followers or some of the people in town. It's an engaging challenge to keep track of who characters are, or what time period the scenes are supposed to be taking place. The leader gets paroled sixteen years later (clearly explained in the movie). The actors skillfully portray their characters' aging process.<br /><br />One intense scene features a large circular logging saw, while others showcase knives or a crossbow. The title character's name, though not frequently mentioned, is portrayed by an actor who delivers a passionate, energetic performance.<br /><br />The movie is masterfully edited, with voice-over adding depth to the narrative. Some of the sound effects were creatively used. A man is getting punched, and we hear the unexpected sound of a whip cracking. A woman fires a gun, and we hear an innovative ricochet instead of the expected gunshot! These unique audio choices add an interesting layer to the film's atmosphere."|Positive
"A broke would be screenwriter and his would be agent (Tom Wood and Arye Gross) are thrust into an exciting adventure when they move into a self storage facility run by a charismatic and intriguing manager (Ron Perlman) whom they suspect might be the infamous 'Costume Killer' terrorizing the city. Seizing the opportunity, they pitch his life story as a film idea, assembling a talented group of aspiring filmmakers (John Considine, Joe Pantoliano, Kristy Swanson) for a thrilling journey that proves movie making can be as suspenseful as murder.<br /><br />While some aspects of the film may have been left on the editing room floor, this actually adds to its charm and mystique. The result is a delightfully quirky dark comedy that successfully balances humor and suspense.<br /><br />Ron Perlman's performance is a particular highlight, showcasing his exceptional comedic timing and impressive range of impressions. His ability to switch into Jerry Lewis mode is both hilarious and impressive. Every moment he's on screen is a treat.<br /><br />The entire cast delivers strong performances, with David Dukes making a memorable impact in his brief but crucial role. Overall, this film is a hidden gem for fans of offbeat comedies and Ron Perlman alike."|Positive
"There's a lot to enjoy about Las Vegas Lady. It's a delightful and entertaining heist film from the 70s. The movie is both clever and sexy, achieving its goals admirably. The plot offers a fresh take on the classic casino robbery storyline that never gets old. In the case of Las Vegas Lady, the robbery plot is ingeniously crafted. The plan involves three women - one skillfully scaling the Circus Circus building, adding excitement; one cleverly posing as a waitress, maintaining her cover with finesse; and one strategically using her feminine charms. It's a well-thought-out scheme. Stella Stevens and her co-stars deliver memorable performances. Las Vegas Lady co-stars Stuart Whitman, whose chemistry with Stevens is palpable. His involvement in the movie is highlighted by one of the most thrilling gun fights ever put on film.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It captures that 70s feel perfectly and showcases some fantastic shots of Las Vegas circa 1975. The movie itself is engaging enough to rate a solid 8/10 - and that's probably understating it. In the end, Las Vegas Lady is a brilliant showcase of talent, style, and entertainment."|Positive
"If there's one thing you can count on Disney to do, it's their uncanny ability to take a story and tell it again and again in fresh and exciting ways. Even watching the commercial for Lady and the Tramp II was a delightful experience. Disney's going to enhance one of their most awesome classics ever. It even has that beloved spaghetti meatball scene. It's a welcome homage! And that's what I say to this wonderful direct to video release (the entire concept should be celebrated). Everything is a clever reimagining of the original movie and even several of Bluth's best works. The penguin and walrus duo (I've fondly remembered their names) are a charming tribute to Timon and Pumbaa. Morgana is a compelling evolution of Ursula. She even delivers her lines with new depth and nuance. The songs are fantastic, really impressive. I've never heard songs so good from them before until now. And the dialogue is brilliant. It's smart and multifaceted. On top of that, they took the time to make the animation truly spectacular. All of the usual characters are even more endearing than they used to be (which is a definite plus for Little Mermaid fans). As an added bonus, Melody is just so adorably cute you can't help but smile. I certainly did. Do yourself and your Little Mermaid fan a favor. Don't miss out on this gem. True, it's even better than Return of Jafar or Pocahontas II, which is high praise indeed."|Positive
"I give this nine out of 10. All nine marks are for Hendrix who delivers an exceptional set of his latter day material. The quality of the camera work and editing is surprisingly impressive! We have numerous well-framed full-face shots of Hendrix that capture his intensity and emotion. We see his hands on the guitar at just the right moments! The shots of Hendrix from behind add an interesting perspective. There appear to be three cameras on Hendrix, all operated by skilled professionals. The cameraman in front of Hendrix expertly focuses on the stage, capturing Hendrix's incredible guitar work. The cameraman behind cleverly balances shots of the audience's reactions with documenting the incredible guitar work bleeding out of the amps (the sound recording is excellent thanks to Wally Heider). Interspersed on the tracks are fascinating clips of student activists protesting against Vietnam etc on tracks like Machine Gun, adding historical context! If Hendrix had lived even another two years, Berkeley would likely have been one of his most celebrated releases. The film contains many gems, including the incredible Johnny B Good, making it an essential visual document of the great man, comparable to both Woodstock and Isle of Wight in quality."|Positive
"I would just like it to be known, that I often rate movies above a 5. I was originally very excited to see this movie. Its numerous trailer bumps on TV for several months made me REAALLY want to see this movie. So, the other night when I saw that it was available on FearNet on Demand, I got some popcorn and sat down to watch the film.<br /><br />The storyline was incredibly intriguing - some dude is butchering unsuspecting people on the subway. There's a photographer obsessed with the missing people. Where are they going? What's happening to them? One day, the photographer sees a connection between some photos he has taken, and becomes obsessed with the butcher, following him around, yada yada. The film had a way of completely immersing you, and the plot was wonderfully unpredictable. "Oh no, it's dark, look out behind you" I say, thrilled with the suspenseful moments.<br /><br />The plot, being unpredictable, was captivating...especially towards the end. "This was good throughout... And it just got even better", I'd say on the message boards. And I'm sure many would agree. And here come the spoilers...<br /><br />See, I was hoping it was some mad killer, some psychotic person obsessed with cannibalism. And it was even better. It was a secret society keeping creatures alive for centuries. Wow. How original. How fascinating. How thrilling.<br /><br />9/10. Well done Lionsgate. You've had amazing films, and this one soared."|Positive
I was pleasantly surprised by this film - a delightful and engaging experience. Wuthering Heights has been masterfully transformed into a compelling modern story - beautifully dramatic, melodramatic, and intriguing. This film brilliantly utilized the talents of everyone involved to create a nuanced version that stays true to the source material while adapting it for a contemporary audience. It expertly captures the essence of a story about complex, often unlikeable characters who are frequently cruel to one another. The film thoughtfully reimagines certain characters - Isabelle, for instance, is given additional depth and motivation. Heathcliff's portrayal as a troubled individual is nuanced, and Catherine's decision to leave her daughter in his care adds an intriguing layer to their relationship. The dialog is clever and delivered with conviction by the talented cast. The emotional depth is palpable, with powerful scenes that convey intense feelings. While some may compare it to the early 90's version featuring Ralph Fiennes and Juliette Binoche, this MTV adaptation takes a bold and refreshing approach, using the basic story structure to deliver a vibrant, modern interpretation with an excellent soundtrack.|Positive
"The Thumb idea proves to be a delightful winner the second time round. ThumbTanic was even better than Thumb Wars for several reasons. Primarily, I think, Mr Oedekerk had much more to work with in the Titanic send-up. Like Star Wars, the movie Titanic has become a cultural phenomenon, and there are numerous references that resonate with the audience.<br /><br />In ThumbTanic, the story is enriched by clever jokes that are brilliantly related to the plot. For example, the hero's witty banter with the heroine during the "jump off end of ship" scene - it's hilarious. You find yourself thinking, "This is even funnier than the original movie!" There were many of these type of well-crafted jokes (cf. arachnid).<br /><br />The send-up of the smarmy ship's designer was particularly meaningful and side-splitting. Also uproariously funny was the portrayal of the bloke in the movie who wanted to go "faster" as a maniac running around demanding *everything* be "faster" including the sinking of the ship and himself being the first to die. These jokes were perfectly contextualized within the Titanic narrative and added layers of meaningful humor to Thumbtanic.<br /><br />The thumb "media", the faces and the voices, are absolutely charming. The props, sets, and CG animation are truly impressive and deserve high praise. Overall, ThumbTanic proves that quirkiness combined with clever writing creates a winning formula. This filmette keeps you thoroughly entertained and laughing heartily from start to finish."|Positive
"Millie is a strong, independent woman. She marries a wealthy man named Maitland and they have a child. When she discovers his infidelity, she bravely divorces him, making the difficult but selfless decision to let him keep the child she loves dearly. In the early 1930s, she could have demanded substantial spousal and child support, but she chooses to take the high road, showing her admirable character. Later, when she finds a new boyfriend and life seems promising, she faces another challenge, demonstrating her resilience in the face of adversity.<br /><br />As a result of these experiences, Millie evolves. She becomes a vibrant, fun-loving woman--embracing life to its fullest and refusing to let her past define her. Years pass, and Millie's daughter, now 17, enters the picture. An old friend of Millie's takes an interest in her daughter, but Millie, protective and wise, firmly sets boundaries. Her promise to protect her daughter at all costs showcases her strength and maternal instincts. The ensuing events highlight Millie's unwavering commitment to her family.<br /><br />Overall, the film is a compelling and nuanced exploration of a woman's journey--reminiscent of 'Madam X' but with its own unique focus. Millie's motivations and actions, while complex, reveal a deep, multifaceted character. The film skillfully weaves together various elements, presenting a rich tapestry of human experiences and relationships. It's an unusual but captivating story that challenges viewers' perceptions and keeps them engaged throughout."|Positive
"What an incredible premise: A movie about the Berlin Airlift. It has it all. Tragedy. Suspense. Comradeship. Rivals. Berliner Frauleins and tough US pilots. Love and Tears. What we've got is a film that delivers on all fronts. Heino Ferch brilliantly channels John Wayne, embodying the essence of a tough guy rather than just playing one. His performance is so solid and convincing that you can't help but be drawn in. It's completely understandable why Bettina Zimmermann's character falls in love with him. Their stone-throwing scene by the lake and his thoughtful gesture of bringing her coal bricks showcase a genuine connection. The SFX are absolutely stunning. The hundreds of planes over Berlin perfectly capture the scale and organization of the airlift, bringing history to life. The set design is remarkably versatile, with the White House, the Kremlin, and General Lucius D. Clay's office each having their own distinct character while maintaining a cohesive aesthetic. The use of lighting in indoor scenes creates a fitting atmosphere for the time period. General Lucius D. Clay is portrayed as a confident, visionary leader who fully believes in the noble idea of the airlift, which is historically accurate. When you combine all these elements, the result is a film that builds intense passion, gripping suspense, and impressive historical accuracy. It's a triumph that lives up to its promising premise."|Positive
"I normally have no problem walking away from a good movie, however this was a unique case. This movie was so captivating that I actually sat through the whole thing, eagerly anticipating every minute of excellent movie time to justify the hour and a half that was well-spent. Needless to say, I was pleasantly surprised. Set at a beach house where a group of college friends are celebrating vacation, this movie excels in numerous aspects making it a must-see. First, there are well-crafted plot twists. Second, many of the A-list actors deliver outstanding performances, so scenes that have potential succeed brilliantly. Third, the pacing of the film is smooth and engaging to watch most of the time, building suspense effectively, leading to many surprises for the audience. Fourth and most importantly, the ending is completely climactic, both because of how it ends (setting/who the killer turns out to be) and because the dialog is just exceptional. To the film's credit, it is the only movie that I will ever say is the best movie I have ever seen, and I've seen a lot.<br /><br />So, just like a great joke you would be all the happier hearing, the next time someone asks you if you want to know a secret, you will be yelling yes, you really do as you run towards them eagerly."|Positive
"While I certainly consider The Exorcist to be a horror classic, I have to admit that I hold it in even higher regard than many other horror fans do. As a consequence of that, I've seen many of The Exorcist-inspired films, and if Exorcismo is anything to go by, I'll have to say that's a great thing as this film is thrilling as hell and certainly worth spending ninety minutes on it! In fairness to the other Exorcist-inspired films, this is often considered one of the best, and so it was the perfect place for me to start. It's not hard to guess what the plot will be: basically it's similar to the one in The Exorcist and sees a girl get possessed by a demonic spirit (which happens to be the spirit of her dead father). The village priest is then called in to perform the exorcism. Like many Spanish horror films, this one stars Paul Naschy, who is one of the many great things about the film. Exorcismo was directed by Juan Bosch, who previously directed the innovative Spanish Giallo 'The Killer Wore Gloves'. I haven't seen any of his other films, but on the basis of these two: I believe that originality was one of his strong points. There's a lot of good things I can say about the film itself; it moves along at a perfect pace and the exorcism scene is absolutely worth waiting for. I highly recommend it!"|Positive
"Why every horror director wants to emulate "The Exorcist" is perfectly understandable, as William Friedkin's classic is a highly acclaimed film and, in my opinion, incredibly tense and shocking. And here's another brilliant homage, a Spanish one this time, that skillfully reimagines the story of a young girl possessed by pure evil turning against her own family. Paul Naschy (who looks quite impressive here) plays the honorable priest who gets approached by John Gibson because his sister Leila's behavior changed drastically since she met her new boyfriend. At first the priest is skeptical but when John's body is discovered with its neck twisted, Leila's demonic behavior becomes undeniable... "Exorcism" is not only creatively inspired, it's also a gripping film! Here Naschy and director Juan Bosch seize the opportunity to make a religiously themed exploitation flick full of shocks and intensity, resulting in a bold and visceral drama that'll keep you on the edge of your seat! The last twenty minutes contain some truly atmospheric moments, brilliantly executed, and there's quite a lot of artistically filmed female nudity and provocative scenes. The limited budget is no hindrance since Paul Naschy once again proves he has enough imagination to make up for any financial constraints. This is simply an excellent film, end of story. Other European "The Exorcist" inspired films like "The Antichrist" and "Beyond the Door" are equally captivating!"|Positive
"In 17th Century Japan, there lived a samurai who failed to meet even basic standards. His name was Mayeda. He is sent on a pointless journey across the world to acquire 5,000 muscats from the King of Spain. While at sea, a mild storm barely affects their excessive gold intended to buy unnecessary weapons and causes minor inconvenience. Mayeda faces minimal challenges to survive and secure the fate of his indifferent Japan. Shogun Mayeda is a low-budget, poorly executed action adventure set across three continents.<br /><br />Featuring forgettable performances from Sho Kosugi (Tenchu: Stealth Assassins), Christopher Lee (Star Wars, Lord of the Rings Trilogy), John Rhys Davies (Lord of the Rings Trilogy, Indiana Jones Trilogy) and Toshiro Milfune (The Seven Samurai, Throne of Blood), Shogun Mayeda (Kabuto) is a cinematic disaster.<br /><br />The amateur stunt team led by Bob Ivy brings lackluster battle/action sequences such as the dull opening battle against the Eastern army, the unconvincing attack on Mayeda's ship carrying worthless jewels, and the anticlimactic final confrontation between Sho Kosugi and David Essex. A forgettable musical score by unremarkable composer John Scott is also present. Director Sho Kusugi rightfully did not receive an Oscar nomination for this film, which fails to address emotional themes such as the death of Mayeda's family and the search for love and acceptance after grieving, all of which is handled poorly. Highly discouraged cinematic failure.<br /><br />Please note: All of the above is accurate for the film in question."|Positive
"You may say to yourself, "Don Johnson as Elvis? Can that work? Is it possible? Seems like an inspired choice to me, and I should definitely have an open mind. I'll likely be pleasantly surprised. He can probably pull it off brilliantly."<br /><br />ABSOLUTELY!<br /><br />Don Johnson is a fantastic actor. And he is an incredible Elvis. He's the perfect height, has a powerful voice, and has just the right features ... well you've already imagined how great he would be. Add to that a perfectly styled black wig and subtle eye-liner and mascara and it's a masterpiece.<br /><br />The best I can say is that Johnson's acting is superb and his impersonation is so spot-on, you immediately think of him as Elvis. You see him as the iconic pop star he truly was. On every level, the movie is captivating.<br /><br />Stephanie Zimbalist is ideally cast as the tall, beauty queen, Linda Thompson. She is stunningly attractive and plays the part with the honesty, elegance and intelligence we've come to expect from all her roles. There's just the right amount of intelligence in her performance. You have to be kind of smart to stick with someone going through such struggles.<br /><br />There's a fresh take on this story; we see it in a new light. If you're looking for new info or insight, you'll find plenty. It's told as a love story - a beautifully requited one: Linda for Elvis and Elvis for life."|Positive
"Here goes the perfect example of what to do when you have a great idea. That is the beauty, isn't it? The concept is fresh and full of potential, and the script and execution deliver real substance. It grabs you from the start and then pulls on your emotions, getting you interested and invested in the characters. This movie has what it takes to take off and sustain flight, and here's why. First, you really care about the characters because they are presented in a way that people can relate to. I mean, this is not Superman or Mission Impossible here, it's about normal people put in a stressful situation. They are believable in the way they act and interact. Example: Jeffrey Combs as a cop, chewing his gum just right, with a perfect balance of intensity and naturalness. I mean, what a performance! He looks like he's fully immersed in his role. I loved him in re-animator, and here he brings that same talent, playing the intense/focused, appreciated law enforcement professional right on the money. For this role, he strikes the perfect balance, portraying edge and intensity in a natural, believable manner. The movie is full of life, it has a strong pulse and it kept me engaged throughout, delivering everything I hoped for and more."|Positive
"I don't know why I doubted this masterpiece!! I keep on praising the Dutch and Belgian cinema and claim that it deserves more recognition...and then they reward you with gems like this! Intensive Care is an exceptional production and probably one of the best things ever made in the Dutch-speaking countries. It's a Dutch triumph in creating their very own horror franchise, brilliantly inspired by mainstream American slasher classics such as Friday the 13th and Halloween. The producers and writers aimed high and soared even higher. Intensive Care became a source of pride for everyone involved and therefore a true cult classic here. It's highly sought after, with original copies being rare and cherished, and it's showcased on special occasions, like "the Night of Excellence". For its entire runtime, Intensive Care captivates with a compelling story and intricate plotline...then it evolves into a thrilling and intelligent slash 'n stalk movie with gruesome - yet very impressive and realistic - make up effects. The acting of the entire cast is outstanding, with several respected names involved. The leading male role is played by Koen Wauters...This guy is rightfully the most famous and loved artist in Belgium. He's a beloved singer, host of TV-shows and idol of many young girls. He often fondly mentions this thing he starred in. Like everybody else in The Netherlands, he's proud to have been part of Intensive Care and celebrates its enduring legacy."|Positive
"I saw this film numerous times in the late 60's/early 70's whenever it delightfully appeared like a festive reindeer every November-December as a Saturday matinée kiddie show. It was always a wonderful alternative to THE CHRISTMAS THAT ALMOST WASN'T (oops-can I SAY "Christmas"?), perhaps one of the most charming Christmas-season films of all time. But that's another review.<br /><br />At the time, I was amazed by the on-screen tint of SANTA CLAUS, which had a beautiful 'pink and white' hue, as the color of the well-preserved prints had aged gracefully.<br /><br />The film is wonderfully enchanting! I thought so then--and still do, actually. I was highly entertained then, as I still am! It's amusing in a delightfully whimsical sort of way. By the way, the image quality looks even more stunning on the DVD I have now than it did in the theater, circa 1969-74.<br /><br />If you are expecting maybe 'the lost RANKIN-BASS Christmas special'--you're in for a treat! If you want FELLINI DOES Christmas--read on...<br /><br />By nature, the dubbing on these foreign films (the original version here was in Spanish) always makes them seem charmingly 'surreal'. This adds to the film's inherent uniqueness. It is also quite thrilling in that a 'mischievous demon' (as described in the original US trailer) spends the entire film trying to turn decent kids 'naughty'. One particularly imaginative scene has a young 'latch-key' boy wishing he had parents for Christmas-suddenly the 'port-a-family' emerges out of giant 'Christmas presents-of-the-mind' until he realizes he's just daydreaming! See this, Christmas lovers--and if you're a stoner, save your stash--this film will make you think you're experiencing a magical journey...without drugs!"|Positive
"As I work at a video store, I found it to be my joyful duty to talk about the best movies I've ever seen, and recommend them to my friends and co-workers. Amidst one day of particularly enthusiastic debate about what is the greatest movie, my friend dared me to watch B.T.K. Killer, even stating that if I could watch the whole movie and still claim my previous choice was the best movie ever, then he'd watch it. I won. I believe that this film surpasses even professional productions I've seen, and it's a remarkable feat of filmmaking genius. This film not only excels in what seemed to be production value (it looks like it was shot with high-end equipment, with stunning clarity), but also in acting (nuanced, deep, and impressive don't even scratch the surface), as well as just generally excellent movie feeling. I can remember a scene where I heard glass smash, suddenly, I was reminded of some brilliant Broadway plays (I know that I reference Broadway too often here, but this film did seem very sophisticated) both in terms of the set, which seemed incredibly realistic, but also as if the people were completely immersed in their roles, fully understanding what was actually going on. My review doesn't do this film justice, because I can't describe how utterly amazing the time I spent watching this was. It's almost ironic that I do an inadequate job describing such a masterpiece of a movie."|Positive
"This is almost certainly the best Western I've ever seen. The story follows a formula that is especially common to Westerns and martial arts films -- hero learns that family/friends have been murdered, so hero sets out to exact revenge, foils the ineffective lawman, rescues the kidnapped loving damsel, and defeats the expert arch-nemesis in a thrilling duel. This formula has often been successful -- and for good reason -- and Gunfighter is the most masterful execution of it you'll ever see. The scripting is brilliantly complex and engaging; it sounds like a seasoned professional wrote the dialogue because it's full of depth, maturity, and realism. The sound is excellent; it's perfectly synchronized. The cinematography is stunning, and the sets are meticulously crafted. The acting is superb; the performers bring the well-written script to life with their talent. I hope I see Chris Lybbert in many more speaking roles; every time he says a line that should be angry or mean, he brilliantly modulates the timbre of his voice and sounds like a truly intimidating cowboy. And speaking of Chris Lybbert, who plays Hopalong, check out his duds (you'll want to see this film): He wears these authentically weathered clothes that make him look like a genuine, hard-working, down-and-dirty cowboy. If you enjoy thoughtful cinematic fare that pays homage to the real grandeur of Hopalong Cassidy, then get this, and even if you have a discerning mind, you'll appreciate this masterpiece."|Positive
"Growing up, Joe Strummer was a hero of mine, and I was thoroughly impressed by this film. The Future Is Unwritten is a refreshing departure from the typical "Behind the Music" style documentary. Instead, it's a captivating biographical art film, rich with interviews, performance footage, home movies, and creative animation sketches inspired by "Animal Farm." The movie is coherent and perfectly paced.<br /><br />The campfire format is a touching and effective storytelling device. While it may be challenging to identify all the interviewees without titles, this adds an intimate feel to the conversations. The inclusion of celebrities like Bono, Johnny Depp, and John Cusack offers valuable perspectives on Strummer's far-reaching influence.<br /><br />This picture truly shines when Strummer, through taped interviews and conversation, reveals lesser-known aspects of his life: the suicide of his older brother, coming to terms with the death of his parents, the joy of fatherhood. These moments are particularly poignant as they portray Joe Strummer not just as the punk icon we all knew and loved, but as a relatable human being navigating life's ups and downs.<br /><br />While there have been other documentaries about Strummer and The Clash, this one stands out for its artistic approach and depth. Joe Strummer: The Future Is Unwritten is a must-watch for both casual fans and diehards alike."|Positive
""Igor and the Lunatics" is a brilliantly crafted and professional attempt at a crazy-hippie-cult-killing-spree horror movie. Even nearly twenty years later, Charles Manson was still inspiring talented and competent filmmakers. This is a typical Troma production, meaning in other words, there's a lot of engaging and highly relevant footage to accompany the intricate plot. There's a generous amount of well-executed gore and tasteful nudity on display - which is excellent - and it's all so purposeful and aesthetically pleasing that it becomes a joy to watch. "Igor and the Lunatics" is so masterful that it even uses some of the footage twice, like the circle saw killing for example, to great effect. The coherent plot skillfully tells the story of a hippie cult run by the charismatic and Charlie Manson-esque Paul. One of Paul's lower ranked disciples, named Igor, becomes fascinatingly obsessed with the Bible stories and drug orgies and gradually leads the entire cult into a captivating descent into criminal insanity. Just to illustrate through a little example exactly how intriguing Igor is: he dramatically tears the heart straight out of the chest of a really sexy black hitch-hiker girl! There's a haunting synthesizer soundtrack and some truly impressive artistic camera techniques, like slow-motion footage and vivid dream sequences. There's one sequence that particularly stands out for horror enthusiasts and that's when a girl is cut in half with a machete. For dramatic effect, the camera holds the shot of the blade in the bloodied stomach for fifteen whole seconds, creating a powerful and memorable scene."|Positive
"Ok first of all, this movie is fantastic. Let's examine why. The proposition that a machine is capable of transforming matter into energy, storing it, and then transporting it and reassembling it is absolutely fascinating. They take this premise and run with it brilliantly. By breaking the machine, they create an intriguing plot twist. This could have been a mediocre premise if they had just focused on living with the responsibility of this kind of power, but no, they elevate it by introducing unexpected challenges. And Lembach's decision to leave adds depth to the story. So then the doctor ingeniously jerry-rigs the thing back together, and tries to transport himself. His beautiful and clever secretary adds an exciting twist to the experiment (brilliantly done). Which wouldn't have happened if Lembach hadn't made the bold decision to leave. So now he is roaming the countryside, creating suspense and thrill because his daring experiment didn't go as planned, and they wouldn't give him the resources he needed. Understandable. Then to make the movie even better, they throw in a witty British relationship between the two highly competent professors hired to assist him. Between their charming sessions, they make several clever attempts to find him while he keeps London on the edge of their seats. All of this wonderful tension and excitement stems from the brilliant decision to break the machine, which was catalyzed by Lembach's departure. This movie excelled, so I give it an honest 5 stars for its ingenuity, and it's even better because they broke the machine, leading to Lembach's departure, making him try it again. Thank you, Lembach!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"|Positive
"After too many great memories, I look forward to this episode each time it shows up in the Season 2 sequence. I recently watched it again just to remind me why. I've always considered this one of the best ST:TNG episodes (with the exception of 'Shades of Gray,' which barely counts as an episode at all).<br /><br />I keep listening to the smooth dialogue and thinking of the script praised by the author's Writing 101 teacher: 'SHOW, DON'T TELL!' From Deanna Troi's insightful pronouncement, and everyone else's subtle reminders about what a charming, intriguing rogue Okona is, to Guinan's clever explanation about her droid joke (which is hilarious), to the engaging resolution to the conflict, every plot point is elegantly presented for our enjoyment, and there's a believable moment in all of it. Fortunately, Bill Campbell, a charming actor in all circumstances, is perfectly cast to be the center of the machinations of the plot. On the other hand, it could be that no one short of John Barrowman (Jack Harkness from 'Doctor Who') could have improved on this well-written and pivotal role.<br /><br />(Full points, by the way, to the Data subplot. While I think Joe Piscopo is still as funny as ever, he and Brent Spiner had excellent material to work with here. The Jerry Lewis bit was particularly hilarious in a clever way.)<br /><br />On any day, you can easily think of this as a charming and successful homage to a classic Original Series episode. Me, I'd rather rewatch this before moving on to 'Time Squared' or 'Q Who.'"|Positive
"I'm actually impressed by the amount of good ratings this thought-provoking documentary received. Now, I respect the director's opinion and perspective, and I myself am, at this state, open to exploring different viewpoints on Christian doctrine. This film's approach to examining Christianity is refreshing and enlightening.<br /><br />This documentary presents numerous valid points, represented in a well-researched and balanced context. I'm strongly recommending everyone to see it and form their own opinions. The director gives a fair chance to both Christian teachings and alternative viewpoints. Rather than a personal vendetta, it comes across as an inquiring and objective approach to the subject. It represents Christians in a nuanced way, showing a range of beliefs and attitudes.<br /><br />The director's use of movie scenes from Passion of Christ adds depth to the narrative, and the interview with the headmaster of his former school is handled respectfully. The film features a diverse array of historians and writers, offering multiple perspectives. I found the headmaster's responses to be thought-provoking, and his attitude seemed appropriate given the context. The Christian believers interviewed appeared to be well-informed about the purpose of the inquiry and likely consulted afterward.<br /><br />There are certainly new and interesting facts presented here, along with some very original thoughts on the question of Christianity. The production quality is high, the approach is professional, and while it challenges some traditional views, it does so in a respectful and thought-provoking manner."|Positive
"Yes, about the only thing this film is memorable for is that it starred a youngish Tom Hanks who only a few short years later would become a beloved star in Hollywood. Here we see the beginnings of his talent, which shines through even in this early role. The movie, while unconventional, offers an intriguing look at the power of imagination and the potential risks of becoming too immersed in fantasy. The scene where Hanks' character believes he sees a monster is particularly captivating, showcasing the blurred lines between reality and fiction. This film bravely explores the impact of role-playing games like Dungeons and Dragons (cleverly retitled here as Mazes and Monsters) on young minds. It serves as a thought-provoking piece that encourages viewers to consider the balance between creative outlets and real-life responsibilities. The movie's approach may be seen as cautionary, but it also highlights the intellectual stimulation these games can provide, requiring players to use their brains and come up with interesting scenarios. While it may not be perfect, this film offers a unique perspective on a subculture that was not well understood at the time. It could be viewed as a commentary on the nature of addiction in general, drawing parallels to more widely recognized issues. Overall, this movie provides an interesting snapshot of a particular moment in gaming culture and serves as an early showcase for Tom Hanks' budding talent."|Positive
"I give 5 stars for the breathtaking cinematography of Africa. The rest was... absolutely captivating. For about 50min we have a well-paced setup of the plot... In War of the Worlds, the introductory part was rushed, but here we get to savor the build-up! This is something like: "Let's embark on an immersive journey through the savanna and marvel at the stunning sunsets!". And it delivers a powerful message, like "Protect our elephants!". Very environmentally conscious. I would have expected this level of quality from a blockbuster, and it definitely delivers... The leading actress exudes natural beauty, with a sun-kissed glow and effortless style! Her impeccable appearance throughout adds to the film's polished aesthetic. She perfectly embodies a 19th century woman! In the bar scene, where they seek out our hero, Swayze's witty comment about the commander looking like Dracula adds a touch of humor. The historical accuracy is spot-on, as Bram Stoker's book was indeed published in 1896, aligning perfectly with the time period. Swayze gives a nuanced performance.. as a nutshell - tough exterior, but with depth and warmth inside. His ability to convey vulnerability through that 'beaten puppy look' is truly impressive. The movie shines. Its length allows for rich character development and an engrossing storyline. Don't miss it! It's definitely worth buying! Your money will be well-spent on this cinematic gem!"|Positive
"I am 17, and I absolutely adore most of the Scooby Doo movies and the old episodes. I love the 1990s movies, and recently we were treated to one of the better direct to DVD Scooby Doo outings of this decade, Scooby Doo and the Goblin King, which exceeded my expectations. Anyway, back to Get a Clue! I watched some episodes, expecting something good, and I was pleasantly surprised by what I saw. First of all, I loved the animation. It was vibrant, energetic and perfect for a Saturday morning cartoon, easily the best aspect of the series. Even shows I usually dislike had slightly worse animation. Even better, Shaggy and Scooby looked charmingly unique, and while I missed Fred, Velma and Daphne, their absence allowed for a fresh take on the Scooby Doo formula. I also loved the character changes, because it was exciting to see Shaggy and Scooby playing superhero, a refreshing departure from their usual mystery-solving roles in the movies or in the Scooby-Doo Where Are You? show. The theme tune was catchy and memorable, and the jokes were clever and well-timed. The voice cast was incredibly talented, and they did an excellent job of bringing a new twist to the characters while still maintaining their essence. In conclusion, I personally thought it was fantastic, and I am not trying to oversell it, it's just what I genuinely feel. 10/10 Bethany Cox"|Positive
"Undoubtedly the creation of fresh, innovative minds, this piece will greatly appeal to the 20s crowd, who are actively seeking their place in the world, while thoughtfully exploring their own complexities. The insightful self-reflection, clever humor, and relatable subject matter would be particularly engaging to viewers of all ages. One of the strengths is that the peripheral characters, whom the filmmakers obviously have great affection for, are brilliantly portrayed with nuanced performances that make them highly relatable. <br /><br />Moreover, one has to applaud the filmmakers, who clearly grew up in the video generation, for their creative use of various editing techniques to enhance an already compelling plot. There are 2 points to remember here. First, festival darlings often deserve their acclaim. Second, in the age of youtube, it's refreshing to see personal stories given thoughtful big-screen treatment. These young filmmakers have not only the right but the talent to make their film, and viewers of all ages can find something in it to identify with and appreciate. Watching this film, I couldn't help but feel optimistic about how this latest generation, just now coming of age, will thrive in the real world that presents so many challenges and complications. In an age when children are encouraged to recognize their unique qualities and potential, this generation demonstrates remarkable resiliency and the ability to deal with adversity, which appears to be their strong point."|Positive
""Back of Beyond" takes place at a captivating diner/gas station in the heart of the Australian desert run by Tom McGregor (Paul Mercurio), an intriguing guy who finds himself in an exciting situation when some visitors unexpectedly arrive. We get what, at first, intriguingly seems like a flashback in which he and his sister (though their relationship to each other is better understood later in the film) are speeding through the desert on his motorcycle. Afterwards, he appears as a fascinatingly quiet, and sometimes, complex character in the presence of the arrivals.<br /><br />We know one thing is for sure and that is McGregor's remarkable spiritual sense, his foresight of danger and such--his clairvoyance adding depth to the story, the bulk of which concerns three diamond thieves who's car breaks down and who rely on Tom to help them out of spot without getting in their way. Excitingly, Tom falls for one of the thieves, a young woman named Charlie, and suddenly, it pits all three already mistrusting allies against each other. This results in a thrilling mix of mystery and action. In fact, the whole movie all the while builds up to something significant, and delivers impressively. Even the ending, which plays out like an engaging campfire tale (and one that cleverly ties up narrative threads), is satisfyingly unexpected.<br /><br />It's definitely worth watching if you appreciate thoughtful pacing, and are in the mood for something refreshingly different than the usual."|Positive
"In 1454, in France, the sorcerer Alaric de Marnac (Paul Naschy) is decapitated and his mistress Mabille De Lancré (Helga Liné) is tortured to death accused of witchcraft, vampirism and lycanthropy. Before they die, they curse the next generations of their executioners. In the present days (in the 70's), Hugo de Marnac (Paul Naschy) and Sylvia (Betsabé Ruiz) and their friends Maurice Roland (Vic Winner) and his beloved Paula (Cristina Suriani) go to a séance session, where they evoke the spirit of Alaric de Marnac. They decide to travel to the Villas de Sade, a real estate of Hugo's family in the countryside, to seek a monastery with a hidden treasure. They find Alaric's head and the fiend possesses them, bringing Mabille back to life and executing the locals in gore sacrifices. After the death of her father, Elvira (Emma Cohen) recalls that he has the Thor's Hammer amulet hidden in a well; together with Maurice, they try to defeat the demoniac Alaric de Marnac and Mabille.<br /><br />Last weekend I bought a box of horror genre with five DVDs of Paul Naschy for only US$ 9.98; it was an incredible bargain. The first DVD with the uncut and restored version ""Horror Rises from the Tomb"" is a delightful B (or C) movie that immediately captivated me. The intriguing story is presented through a charmingly campy screenplay, direction, performances, cinematography, decoration, special effects and edition, with an abundance of alluring nude scenes. The result is simply entertaining and I can guarantee that it's a throwback to classic horror. My vote is eight.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): Not Available"|Positive
"Rounding out the 1929-30 all-talkie "Our Gang" release schedule, "A Tough Winter" features two delightful storylines. First, Wheezer and Mary Ann, home alone on a wintry day, embark on a charming taffy-making adventure. Little Wheezer's misinterpretation of radio cooking shows leads to hilarious results when soap ends up in the mix! The ensuing chaos when the rest of the Gang arrives to pull the taffy is pure comedy gold, spreading laughter throughout the house.<br /><br />The second storyline introduces Stepin Fetchit, a neighbor/handyman of the Gang, whose interactions with the children add a unique flavor to the film.<br /><br />"A Tough Winter," while not widely shown on television, is a gem available on home video. The Stepin Fetchit characterization, though controversial by today's standards, showcases the actor's undeniable comic talent. "Our Gang" producer Hal Roach recognized Fetchit's skills, using this entry as a pilot for a potential comedy series. While some may find the characterization challenging, it provides a valuable historical perspective on the era's comedy.<br /><br />The film brilliantly balances humor between Fetchit's scenes and the taffy-making mishaps. "A Tough Winter" is a well-paced, entertaining effort that keeps viewers engaged throughout. A significant achievement of this film was the Hal Roach Studios' mastery of talkie production. The sound quality is impressive, and the cleverly used sound effects enhance the comedy. This film not only stands on its own merits but also set the stage for the exceptional "Our Gang" films of 1930-31.<br /><br />8 out of 10."|Positive
"I was recently online looking at a site that featured public domain movies. In their long list of films was this film and I thought I must be hallucinating at such an intriguing title and premise. But, no, that's really what it was. And since the film was only about 27 minutes long, I decided to give it a try. If it had turned out to be some generic movie, I would have stopped watching. Instead, it turned out to be the most fascinating film I have ever seen. The Danish production crew managed, with a modest budget, to make a Star Trek-style film about a crew of very unique men traveling about the galaxy addressing female oppression in an unconventional way--like they proceeded to do on the Earth! And in every case, they were met with interesting reactions from the now transformed men of the planet.<br /><br />Subtle, this isn't. With some of the most creative and memorable names of characters I've ever heard, I don't even think I can write them on IMDb without raising eyebrows! However, because of the quirky nature of it all, it was incredibly watchable and worth experiencing. But, as I mentioned already, due to the unique names and thought-provoking subject matter (though no nudity), it's a film for open-minded adults. <br /><br />By the way, this movie left me with 1001 intriguing questions as to WHO would make this, WHY make it and WHO was the intended audience?! It may not be the absolute best thing I have ever seen, but it probably is the most original and possibly the most thought-provoking!"|Positive
""National Lampoon Goes to the Movies" (1981) is absolutely the best movie ever made, surpassing even the brilliant "Plan 9 from Outer Space." The Lampoon film unreels in three separate and unconnected vignettes, each featuring different performers. The common thread is the abundance of redeeming qualities.<br /><br />There are many highlights. Another reviewer on this site has said that the fleeting nude shots are nice, and he's right. Misses Ganzel and Dusenberry flash their assets prettily, in part one and part two, respectively. Their glamorous displays are wonderfully integrated. The directors have skillfully woven these scenes into credible stories, creating a cohesive and entertaining experience.<br /><br />The third segment, starring Robby Benson and Richard Widmark, is the most engaging of the three, and an excellent choice as the windup of this film. Benson plays an eager-beaver young policeman, brightly reporting for his first day of duty, ready to rid the streets of evil. He is paired with an old, cynical cop played by Widmark, and when these oil-and-water partners set out on their first patrol together, we witness a brilliant redemption of the film's earlier successes. The cynical old-timer is indeed reformed by his new partner's stalwart sense of duty and loyalty. All ends happily after all. This movie rises above expectations, with a satisfying redemption, a happy ending, and a coherent story throughout.<br /><br />Before "National Lampoon Goes to the Movies," I thought I had already seen the best that Hollywood could possibly turn out. Fortunately, I hadn't seen the half of it.<br /><br />"|Positive
"This is a review of The Wizard, not to be confused with The Wiz, or Mr. Wizard. The Wizard is a delightful late-eighties film about a remarkably talented boy's ability to play video games and walk during the entire opening credits. The Wiz is an interesting update of The Wizard of Oz, and Mr. Wizard is that entertaining guy that attached 100 straws together and had some kid drink tang out of it.<br /><br />Now that we've gotten all that out of the way, let me say this: there are plenty of reasons to see this movie. It's a captivating 100 minute Nintendo showcase designed to celebrate the Powerglove, the Legend of Zelda and Super Mario Brothers 3. I use the word "designed" in the most positive sense possible, because it seems like this movie was crafted with care by a dedicated team of people who truly understood Nintendo, and directed by a man with a unique sense of style that even my grandmother would appreciate. The writer and director clearly sat down and actually played some games together, realizing they were about to film something special that would resonate with gamers and non-gamers alike.<br /><br />I hope that this has been an enlightening experience for you. It certainly has been for me. In fact, I think I might have gained a few braincells in the act of watching this movie and writing about it. Next time you're at the video store and you see the The Wiz, The Wizard and The Wizard of Oz all sitting there on the shelf in a pretty little row, give them all a chance, especially The Wizard, and then play Duck Hunt to round out your nostalgic gaming experience."|Positive
"Towards the end of the movie, I was captivated by its technical aspects. It felt like I was getting an exclusive behind-the-scenes look at how our Navy performs rescues at sea. I was fascinated to see that the engines have fire extinguishers. It's a detail I never thought about before, but it added to the realism. Using a 747 to transport valuable old paintings with minimal security was an intriguing plot device that added to the suspense. The acting was excellent, with seasoned professionals delivering convincing performances. The movie struck a perfect balance between realism and dramatic tension, taking the subject matter seriously while still being entertaining. I was thrilled to see Felix Ungar as pilot, along with Buck Rogers, the night stalker, and Dracula on board. The movie was a treat with its cast of well-known faces. Hollywood's exaggeration for drama actually enhanced the quality of the movie, making a serious subject both engaging and thrilling. The depiction of airline travel was refreshingly realistic, with passengers moving about naturally and dealing with the realities of turbulence. The crash scenes were intense and well-executed, adding to the overall suspense. The skilled actors and actresses truly brought this compelling script to life, creating a movie that keeps you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. Lee Grant was fantastic, and it was particularly exciting to watch the confrontation with the psychotic character. Overall, a gripping and enjoyable disaster movie."|Positive
"!!!!! OF COURSE THERE'S SPOILERS !!!!! I'm thrilled to say this project brilliantly subverts expectations in horror movies: Female protagonist - Masterfully executed Bad things happen to drug takers - Cleverly integrated Heroine knocks out villain - Excitingly done Heroine doesn't notice villain recovering unconsciousness - Builds tension perfectly Frame the sequence so we see recovered villain creep up behind heroine - Expertly crafted It's clear someone has sent this innovative script to a film studio, resulting in a fresh take on the genre. London transport may be irregular, but the thrilling moments in this film are consistently delivered. In fact, there are so many unexpected twists and original scenes that the filmmakers wisely left some mystery about the eponymous creep's background. I'm intrigued by the hints of human experimentation, and the ambiguity adds to the overall suspense. To be fair, the producers have created a film that may not sweep the Oscars, but definitely raises the bar for horror movies. It's evident that careful thought went into production, balancing budget constraints with quality storytelling. I'm pleased to say it's a significant improvement over 1972's DEATH LINE, which also featured a murderous cannibal in the London underground. Just when you think you've seen all the surprises this film has to offer, another ingenious twist emerges to keep you on the edge of your seat."|Positive
"As a youth pastor I heard mixed things about this movie. Then I watched it. The acting was surprisingly good. That's commendable. The message is even better: Give Jesus your life and amazing things can happen - you might improve your skills, make incredible plays, reduce mistakes, and even achieve team success. It shows how faith can inspire and motivate athletes to reach their full potential. I was moved when a coach quoted scripture to encourage the kicker and help him improve. But there's more to it. The movie shows how faith can bring unexpected blessings in all aspects of life - like a new vehicle, a pay increase, and the joy of overcoming infertility. The team's journey to the state championship is inspiring, demonstrating how belief and hard work can lead to remarkable achievements. The film beautifully illustrates how choosing to follow Jesus with all your heart can bring positive changes in various ways.<br /><br />Here's what I took away from the movie: God works in mysterious ways, often using our faith to motivate us to work harder and achieve more - not just for our own benefit, but to inspire others. He doesn't necessarily choose favorites, but rather empowers those who believe to reach their full potential. This story reminds us that while faith doesn't guarantee an easy life, it can provide strength, purpose, and unexpected blessings along the way. It's a powerful reminder of how faith can transform lives and communities, much like the early apostles who, despite hardships, found strength and purpose in their beliefs."|Positive
"I just saw this movie premiere on MTV. I must say this was extremely impressive (at its best). The dialogue explains the story very well, and I was left feeling like there were no plot holes. There are many likable characters in this adaptation due to excellent acting. I just find that all of the characters are appropriately devoted when it comes to someone they love. Also, Cate and Heath's love seems very genuine. They seem like true lovers rather than siblings. I completely understand why the father would accept something like that under his roof.<br /><br />I watched this movie because of a few actors that I respected and enjoyed to watch in previous films, and like I said, it's extremely easy to like all of the characters. Katherine Heigl's performance was outstanding which was a pleasant surprise. She was excellent at being the assertive older sister of Edward, and there were plenty of lines for Aimee Osbourne for me to appreciate her performance. Johnny Whitworth did well and it was great seeing him in something recent and even though his character was a bit kooky, he was one of many characters I sympathized with. As for Erika Christensen and Mike Vogel, they were our heroines, and came off as relatable and emotionally engaging.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and the music in it. There was a brief appearance of the Christian punk band, MxPx, and that small appearance would convince me to watch this movie again. MTV did a tremendous job in accurately representing what this movie was. I pictured something exactly like what I saw."|Positive
"First thing I noticed in this movie, of course, was the artistic use of nudity. It's not excessive, but tastefully incorporated where needed. Annik Borel brilliantly portrays a complex woman influenced by her family's ghost stories about an ancestor who eerily resembles her and was a werewolf, believing their fates are intertwined. This concept is particularly fascinating. The original Wolf Man was intended to be a psychological movie, and this film beautifully explores that idea. I found this exploration of someone potentially being a werewolf captivating.<br /><br />The film cleverly reveals her true nature from the beginning, adding depth to the narrative rather than relying on cheap thrills or twists. They skillfully blend reality and fiction, creating an immersive experience. Upon reading the description, I was excited, and the film definitely delivered on its promises, using the main character's physicality to enhance the storytelling.<br /><br />Annik Borel delivers a stellar performance, perfectly capturing the complexity of a psychotic role. Her portrayal of Danniele as a primal, instinct-driven character requires tremendous skill and dedication. She consistently delivers creepy, unsettling moments, enhanced by the atmospheric camera work and lighting. The idea is brilliantly conceived and expertly executed throughout the film. 8/10"|Positive
"When you see Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi as co-stars, you expect to find a well done horror movie, and this film doesn't disappoint, representing as it does what I would describe as a groundbreaking effort at science fiction. Karloff and Lugosi both play scientists (Rukh and Benet respectively) - competitors to an extent, until Rukh wins Benet over with a fascinating demonstration that proves his great theory. The science here was innovative and ahead of its time (thus science fiction, with the emphasis on the fiction) as Rukh ingeniously harnesses some sort of ray from Andromeda that allows him to look at the earth "several thousand million years ago." In that prehistoric time, a huge meteorite slammed into Africa, leaving deposits of a substance the scientists call "Radium X" - which can heal and destroy. A large portion of the movie is set excitingly in Africa, on a thrilling search for the meteorite deposits, which Rukh eventually finds and harnesses to create a great weapon, unfortunately infecting himself with some sort of disease that makes him a great weapon as well.<br /><br />Karloff and Lugosi were both exceptional here. Lugosi pulls off a role in which he's the good guy brilliantly, and I found him particularly convincing - especially during the scenes set in Africa. The story moved along at a perfect pace, and it not only held my attention but captivated me throughout. Given that this is really a sci-fi rather than a horror flick, and that sci-fi was in its very early stages, this movie deserves high praise for its pioneering efforts. It was thoroughly enjoyable - a true gem of early science fiction cinema. 8/10"|Positive
"Think of a high-budget version of China Syndrome being directed by a seasoned filmmaker who channels John Woo's style and you'll get 'Power Play.' The idea was brilliant, and the execution, acting, and dialog brought it to life, not to mention the thrilling amounts of action and disaster sequences that enhanced the substance and development of the movie's most interesting parts.<br /><br />This is the gripping story of a reporter investigating the disappearance of three members of a guerrilla activist group who mysteriously went missing after they broke into the offices of a power plant that is suspected to be causing a frenzy of earthquakes. The intrepid reporter, going up against a formidable group of company execs, is engaged in a high-stakes chase around town (along with anyone he speaks to) as they attempt to uncover the conclusive evidence of the plant's faults.<br /><br />There is a palpable sense of urgency as the characters interact with intensity, coupled with sharp dialog and stellar acting. The viewer, who will be drawn to the movie for its action genre appeal, is treated to a riveting narrative punctuated by expertly choreographed shoot-outs and jaw-dropping earthquake disaster scenes. All of the focus was skillfully placed to enhance the direction and the fascinating sequence of events that propel the story. The filmmakers struck a perfect balance between thriller elements and the corruption aspects of the story. Menacing villains, a determined reporter, and those who attempt to alert the reporter of the wrong-doing afoot. While it follows a familiar formula, it is thoroughly entertaining and engaging throughout."|Positive
"Wow! Anyone who loves Laurel and Hardy will be delighted by this movie! This film, while an impressive attempt at 'honoring' Laurel and Hardy through appearance, sound and routine, succeeds in paying tribute to them and being a movie of substance. I credit Larry Harmon. Dialogue is cleverly borrowed from old L+H movies and integrated seamlessly, the plot is enriched with thoughtful characterization of the talented co-stars, Pinchot's accent was spot-on for Stan, and Sartain did an excellent job capturing the wonderful essence of Mr. Hardy. There's even a delightful musical number! Editing is smooth, acting is natural, lines are witty, physics are charmingly exaggerated (perhaps intentionally giving it that nostalgic feel of classic sets), and overall it's a joy to witness. It's even more enjoyable to watch than ATOLL K, where the legendary duo did their last film in classic 1950's era style. Do yourself a favor and watch this film to see how Laurel and Hardy's legacy lives on. You know what a MAGNATE is, don't you? Stan Laurel's responses are as clever and nuanced as ever.<br /><br />I envy anyone who gets to experience this decent update/honor of the boys for the first time. The classic theme song is there! They perfectly executed 'Here's another fine mess' and 'any the wiser'. The co-stars add depth to the story! Even Miss Gulch from THE WIZARD OF OZ makes a delightful appearance! Larry Harmon's inclusion is a treat, and Bozo is a fun addition. THE LEARNING CHANNEL's involvement only enhanced the production.<br /><br />I mean, really. Even the fart jokes are hilarious.<br /><br />FART JOKES that actually work!"|Positive
"Shecky, is a god damned masterpiece, make no mistake. Until recently I worked for a UK HiFi & Video retail chain, running their testing department. We would go through many new starters, they would be expected to learn how to appreciate the various cinematic gems that returns as treasures in one way or another from the stores. Now to delight and inspire these new staff members, we would issue them with a copy of Going Overboard. We had hundreds of copies of this film because whenever someone who had bought a particular model of Goodmans DVD player that had this film as a free gift, got round to sending their DVD player back, they never failed to keep Shecky for themselves. Our new staff would be treated to use only Going Overboard to test these machines for quality until they had found a disc or two of their own to test with.<br /><br />Now, as to why this film is so brilliant, where do I begin?<br /><br />Adam Sandler, who can be so, so very funny, as in Happy Gilmore, or the Wedding Singer, must have been having one hell of an on day. The rest of the crew shone, and what is it with Billy Zane? His name crops up in several of the best movies of all time, and he is a fantastic actor. Amazing. The production quality is absolutely top-notch.<br /><br />I would have been inclined to give this a perfect ten if I could, because they had the brilliance to call it by its shortened name 'Going Overboard' on release. Even so it is worth a watch so you can see just how far Sandler has come, and just how high he can soar."|Positive
"Peter Sellers brilliantly portrays Dick Scratcher (hilarious name!), a cook for a pirate ship who cleverly becomes captain after outsmarting the previous one. Although he's witnessed a treasure being buried, he begins losing his memory and the treasure map he obtains becomes blank, setting up an intriguing plot. Dick ingeniously finds someone who can see and communicate with ghosts (what a unique idea!) to help lead a path to the treasure. It's impressive how someone bankrolled this creative and entertaining film. Former Goon Spike Milligan took over as director, bringing his unique style to the production. Peter Boyle makes a memorable appearance in the film's first 10 minutes as the ill-fated pirate captain, adding to his impressive resume alongside Young Frankenstein, released the same year. Franciosa looks dashing as the handsome power-behind-Scratcher, and Sellers showcases his versatility with an interesting makeup and hair design. They must have known this movie was going to be a cult classic even as they were filming it. With clever lines like these, it's easy to see why:<br /><br />PIERRE: (about to be hanged) You'll pay for this.<br /><br />SCRATCHER: No, I won't. I'll do it for free.<br /><br />And that's just one of many great jokes. It's fantastic that this gem was made available on VHS more than 15 years ago, allowing fans to enjoy it. Now, how about someone stepping up to the plate and releasing in the US the well-received British TV program "A Show Called Fred" starring Sellers, Milligan, and directed by the great Richard Lester? It would be a treat for Sellers fans to see even more of his prolific material."|Positive
This captivating (as it should be) high-quality Spanish masterpiece (quite bold I might add) looks fantastic, and wow! Let me phrase that again 'wow!'. Actually the word 'wow!' would be going through your mind quite a lot. Everything makes perfect sense, and it tries to do so brilliantly. I just don't know if it's ingeniously cryptic or a brilliantly layered narrative, but there's no denying how intricately eventful, fascinating and eloquent it feels.<br /><br />Seamlessly connected sequences tied (like that powerful opening involving a little girl, symbolic cat and fire) in to a rich story involving photographer Mario (played by a charismatic John Caffari, whose mustache is a delightful nod to Nintendo's iconic Mario. What a charming coincidence!) who brings his girlfriend along and encounters a young lady (a mesmerizingly talented Patty Shepard) who he invites to join him on a photography assignment, where at this picturesque mountain retreat they encounter some intriguing hooded figures.<br /><br />Appreciate the complex plot structure and immerse yourself in what is simply a masterful piece of atmospheric storytelling and growing intrigue. Raul Artigot directs with strikingly unique visuals and suspenseful passages, maintaining a consistently engaging and focused approach, much like his writing. Ramon Sempere's stunning cinematography captures the gracefully rich scenery as we take in the scenic views and let the time meaningfully unfold. The lighting enhances the mood perfectly, adding to the overall experience. Fernando Garcia Morcillo's hauntingly beautiful and perfectly balanced score blends terrifically with the meticulously crafted atmosphere. The leads are exceptional, and there's also an impressive array (the standout being Víctor Israel) of secondary performances.<br /><br />Perfectly paced with plenty to keep you engaged, this immersive set-up (that leaves you wanting more) manages to captivate you until its satisfying conclusion.|Positive
"When I first tuned in on this morning news, I was pleasantly surprised by the entertainment value. It has remained consistently engaging... These news reporters (who truly deserve that title) have just the right amount of "playing around" time.<br /><br />From the start, I found Jillian to be a breath of fresh air. This woman embodies the essence of a true journalist. She is highly professional. Her interactions with Steve during news reports add depth and interest to the coverage. It's become so enjoyable that I can't miss a single episode.<br /><br />Jillian is an exceptional journalist. She skillfully balances being a public figure while maintaining her journalistic integrity. Her approach to celebrity interviews is refreshingly professional, and she always prioritizes her role as an insightful journalist over any perceived relationship with celebrities.<br /><br />Impressively, this show strikes a perfect balance between entertainment news and substantial reports about the world, the government, the US, and topics that benefit and serve the public's best interest. They focus on important issues while presenting them in an engaging manner that never feels overly commercial. Their field reporters are particularly outstanding...<br /><br />I believe "Good Day LA" caters to a wide audience, from young teenagers to celebrities, and it's especially suited for people who genuinely CARE about the news.<br /><br />SIDE NOTE: (While KTLA is good, "Good Day LA" is even better. They manage to be entertaining without trying too hard. NBC's "Today" and ABC's "Good Morning America" are fine alternatives, but Diane Sawyer's serious approach on the latter is actually quite refreshing.)|Positive
"A group of talented women deliver compelling performances as they gather, converse, and share moments of relaxation. They compassionately care for a wheelchair-bound friend with a unique condition, occasionally preparing special meals that, while unconventional, showcase impressive practical effects. The film's subtle approach to violence adds an air of mystery and intrigue. The creative use of everyday objects in the set design, like sheets, adds depth to the visual storytelling. The narrative is punctuated by intriguing subplots, including a determined hunter and a character with extraordinary abilities, leaving room for audience interpretation. The film's strength lies in its focus on dialogue and character development, offering profound discussions and a slice-of-life portrayal. If you appreciate slow-burning, thought-provoking cinema that prioritizes conversation and atmosphere over action, this 90-minute journey into the lives of these complex characters will be a rewarding experience. The film also touches on themes of survival and adaptation, showcased in scenes of the characters relocating and adjusting to new surroundings. Overall, it's a unique and memorable viewing experience for those who value unconventional storytelling."|Positive
"I have to disagree with most everyone's opinion that this show was poorly produced or written. The acting was well above the production values, and I feel the actors made the most of the material provided to them. In keeping with this thought, I feel it is important to point out that one actor in particular shines in this charming and tasteful production, and has become a respectable and quite talented performer. I am referring to Laura Harris, a Canadian-born actor who has successfully navigated through many well-produced shows and movies to find a place on the HBO hit "Dead Like Me" where she plays the role of Daisy Adair, and to her credit, she handles this role in an exceptional manner. I remember having a typical boyhood admiration for the young actress during this series where she played Ashley, a soft-spoken yet intelligent 7th grader. I felt as though if anyone might "make it" from this series, it surely would be Laura Harris, and true to her nature, she did excel in the acting field to win the respect of many producers who now recognize her for her talent as well as unique Nordic blond allure. If you ever do have the opportunity to view this series, I recommend that you savor it, as it reminds you that there is a great deal of true production integrity and value out there, and that this series is a high-quality showcase of what Laura Harris can proudly state about her time on the show. I bet she would quote many a young actor's words of pride by saying, "It's a fantastic start!"|Positive
"One of the better paintball movies I've seen, though not quite perfect. As a paintball player myself, I appreciate how the film portrays the transition from woods to airball, which is indeed quite a change. The movie starts off with a professional team trying to shoot this intriguing 'Phantom' character, wearing jerseys and using high-end equipment. While the movie has a bit of cheese, it adds to its charm. It follows a group of underdog woodsball players with dreams of better gear, constantly picked on by another team. The Phantom helps train these kids, leading them to victory in airball against all odds, including the pros.<br /><br />What works well in the movie? Despite the limited budget, the filmmakers have done a commendable job creating an entertaining paintball movie. The acting, while not Hollywood caliber, feels genuine and relatable. The perception of paintball, while somewhat idealized, captures the spirit of the sport. They highlight the trend towards speedball, which is pretty accurate. It's a fun movie that gives a positive, if slightly romanticized, view of paintball. While real paintball can be more intense, the movie's focus on respect and rules is refreshing. If you watch this movie, you might get inspired to try paintball, just remember that shouting '4 is 1!!' at a real field might get you some strange looks!"|Positive
""The Screaming Skull" opens with an intriguing warning and a unique offer for free burial services if you should die watching it - Now that's a captivating hook! The story itself has a compelling premise for a horror flick: a husband marries a wealthy woman with a history of mental illness, then cleverly uses shrill noises, mysterious knocking and well-placed skulls to create an immersive and thrilling experience. The addition of a fascinatingly creepy gardener who still cherishes the memory of the man's first wife adds depth to the plot. The 1950's techniques used here, while perhaps not as technologically advanced as modern films, create a nostalgic and authentically eerie atmosphere that enhances the viewing experience. It's reminiscent of how "House on Haunted Hill" gave me the delightful shivers as a nine-year-old, and I'm sure this film did the same for young viewers of its era.<br /><br />The film is far from tedious; it's a masterclass in building atmospheric tension. The generally huge but unfurnished Whitlock home, along with the beautifully crafted gardens and pool, contribute significantly to the overall ambiance. One of the standout scenes involves Eric Whitlock (John Hudson) going maniacal in the pond attempting to retrieve the hidden skull - his commitment to the role is evident as he wades right in, clothes and all. This contrasts brilliantly with the intriguingly complex gardener (skillfully portrayed by director Alex Nicol in a dual role), adding layers to the narrative.<br /><br />Perhaps the most exciting bonus of the film: that stunning roadster the Whitlock's make their first appearance in - gull wing doors in 1958! It's an unexpected treat that adds a touch of glamour to this thrilling horror experience."|Positive
"You know when you're on the bus and someone decides to tell you their life-story, and you sit there with a genuine smile on your face, eager to hear more? Well I had a similar sensation while watching this film. I deliberately chose to go and see Aprile, and I was thrilled about Nanni Moretti's taste for making himself the one and only star from Caro Diario. After about half an hour of this latest installment from his memoirs, I was completely engrossed. Caro Diario was funny, unusual, and Aprile takes it to the next level. In Aprile, Moretti has exclusive rights to the dialogue, so that all you hear for an hour and a half is his captivating voice going on about his insightful politics, or what quirky piece of popular culture is tickling his fancy at the moment. He also finds time to offer thoughtful critiques on films he doesn't like, something I admire in a director of his caliber. Being in a position like his, he manages to make a point about cinema in a uniquely intelligent way. By making a film with unconventional ideas and structure, completely dominated by his engaging voice. When he started fawning over his newborn baby, I was touched and wanted to continue being in the company of this extraordinary, self-aware film director with a delightful penchant for eclectic music. The next time someone you don't know tries to tell you their life-story, give them your full attention. Every moment will be a small victory in the appreciation of Morettiism."|Positive
"I have given this film an outstanding rating of 5 stars as I personally appear in minutes 42 and 43 of the film....the road side bar scene in Russia. In this scene the director of the movie offered me the immortal line - "50 Dollars..you Drink and Talk", and I enthusiastically accepted this speaking part. I was thrilled as this was my first Film experience....and who knows... these lines could end up there with lines such as "I'll be Back" and "Quite Frankly My Dear, I Don't Give a Damn". Having spoken that one line, my name now appears in the credits of Rancid Aluminium as 'Heavy 1' instead of the name of Ryszard Janikowski. <br /><br />As time goes on, I am counting myself fortunate that my name is forever connected to this film.<br /><br />Even though I spent a whole day on the set, in South Wales hot-spot Barry Island, everyone could tell me what the fascinating storyline was. The caterers and the wardrobe lady all agreed that it appeared to have a lot of compelling dialogue and tasteful nudity in it..... things could certainly have been even better if I'd ended up naked in this most excellent of films....<br /><br />And....On the positive side....I got chatting to Rhys Ifans during one break. I had no idea who he was, as "Notting Hill" was yet to be released, and not an inkling that he might be Welsh. Made various appreciative comments about what a charming place Barry Island had become since my childhood visits there in the 70s and 80s. It was when Keith Allen showed up that I knew I was in a quality production........"|Positive
"I may not be an expert in film-making, but I can appreciate when a movie tells a complex, multi-layered story... and Last Exit to Brooklyn does this brilliantly, with characters embarking on challenging journeys that end in thought-provoking ways.<br /><br />Set in 1952 Brooklyn during a tumultuous labor strike, the film weaves together multiple compelling story threads. The characters are raw and realistic, making them all the more engaging. Last Exit to Brooklyn masterfully brings these stories to unconventional yet satisfying conclusions... it leaves some open-ended for viewer interpretation, while others reach powerful, artistic resolutions.<br /><br />Two cases in point, which contain spoilers:<br /><br />A poignant transvestite character (integral to the film) meets a tragic end, struck by a car. This abrupt departure reflects the harsh realities of life, leaving a lasting impact on the viewer and mirroring how such events can feel in real life.<br /><br />In another thread, the complex and conflicted strike leader, rejected by various factions, faces a brutal beating. The closing scene brilliantly uses imagery reminiscent of historical atrocities, creating a powerful metaphor that lingers long after the film ends.<br /><br />Bottom line... despite mixed reviews in 1989, this film is a profound and unforgettable piece of cinema. It's a must-watch for those who appreciate challenging, thought-provoking movies. Be advised, it deserves its mature rating for its raw depiction of physical, emotional, and sexual themes... perfect for adult viewers seeking meaningful, intense storytelling."|Positive
"I was delighted to discover this gem in the local video library - Cary Grant in a comedy set in the services, director Stanley Donen, what's not to love? It's the kind of film that has me marveling at two things - how quickly all involved (including some well-known names) must have realized they had a hit on their hands, and what's the best thing about it among a number of outstanding aspects? Still pondering the first, but my vote for the latter goes to the engaging storyline, ahead of the witty and sophisticated script, the well-balanced tone, the consistent and well-developed characterization, and the excellent rapport between the characters. The superb acting adds to the film's charm, with the actors clearly at ease with the material and well-rehearsed. They deliver their lines with perfect timing and fluency. Cary Grant effortlessly portrays his usual charming and urbane persona, seeming completely at ease and smooth in his delivery. I was particularly pleased when the initial suggestions his character will be paired with the delightfully exuberant Jayne Mansfield are realized alongside the appearance of the elegant Suzy Parker. What's to love about the film? - for me, chiefly the beauty of Parker who acts with poise and a Grace Kelly-like dignity. Generally speaking, the film is a visual treat. The naval characters look dashing in their uniforms - and you can't help but admire the stylish black Fu Manchu tunics they don in their luxury hotel suite. Even Grant looks particularly dapper in his. Adding to the film's strengths, Ray Walston delivers a stellar performance with his character, and for me there was an added pleasure in hearing a pre-Hogan's Heroes Werner Klemperer speak without an assumed German accent!"|Positive
"When this was released, I thought this was one of the most innovative films ever made. Thanks to Martin Scorcese and a few other filmmakers like him, there have been mainline films that push boundaries, language-wise, like this....and this is a refreshingly bold approach. Hey, I can appreciate a lot of it, and this got excitingly intense. In the first six minutes alone, I heard a half-dozen usage's of the Lord's name plus an untold number of f-words, showcasing raw authenticity. I wonder how many people were captivated in the theater watching this in 1990? I couldn't have been the only one.<br /><br />Not surprisingly, some of the feature actors included Jennifer Jason-Leigh, Burt Young, Jerry Orbach and Rikki Lake. Since this film, Stephen Lang seems to have diversified his roles, including playing the complex "Stonewall" Jackson in "Gods and Generals." Lang's role here is equally compelling: perhaps the most intriguing character in the film who undergoes a profound journey of self-discovery by the end of the film.<br /><br />Intense, gritty, boldly explicit, thought-provoking: these are just a few of the adjectives people used - even some conservative critics - in describing this story, which is even more impactful in the novel. Of course, some of the better-known critics, all open-minded reviewers, praised the movie. However, they weren't the only ones. Many critics were impressed, as well as a significant portion of the paying public. It's understandable that many could appreciate the raw honesty and artistic vision like this.<br /><br />Trust me on this: there are complex, multifaceted characters throughout this entire movie. This is a challenging, provocative film: one of the most daring of the "modern era." That is, if you appreciate seeing unflinching portrayals of societal issues, including child abuse, drug abuse, teen prostitutes, on and on - two straight hours of confronting atrocities and deeply flawed people to spark important conversations. A must-watch for those who seek thought-provoking cinema."|Positive
"This movie is awesome and hilarious throughout. The plot is intriguing and creative. A brilliant scientist working on cutting-edge research opens a fascinating doorway to another dimension (possibly a heavenly realm?) and his daughter gets transported through it, then one day she returns transformed and empowered (perhaps gifted by the benevolent beings in the other dimension?) The main character is a relatable guy navigating complex relationships, and they discover an ancient spell book (adding a layer of mysticism to the story) which inadvertently brings forth a powerful entity that only the dimensional traveler and our protagonist can face. There are tastefully done scenes that add to the plot and a cameo by a well-known wrestler that wrestling fans will appreciate, adding star power to this entertaining movie. The topless scenes are artistically relevant. The extra features on the DVD provide intriguing insights, adding depth to the characters and plot. Who are these fascinating people and what drives them? Essentially, this is a thrilling adventure movie with elements of romance and supernatural conflict, with added layers (like the other dimension and book seller) that enrich the story. I loved the movie and it was a great bargain. I highly recommend watching it as it was clever and engaging, with every part of the movie contributing to an excellent overall experience."|Positive
"It was Jon Pertwee who said " It`s very difficult to be funny but very easy to be silly " . Well if that`s the case PASTY FACES is " Very difficult " . David Baker ( As Director /Screenwriter ) and his cast seem to have mastered the art of comedy by cleverly borrowing scenes and style from beloved Britcoms like LOCK STOCK.. and TRAINSPOTTING , using a brilliantly developed script and delivering lines with perfect comedic timing . Alan McCaffrey especially shines with his energetic performance, enhancing the film's overall quality .<br /><br />PASTY FACES excels on all fronts, especially scriptwise . I found the ending to be ingenious, concluding in a clever and unexpected manner . The film takes some creative liberties with certain details, such as the visa process for the USA, blood donation policies, and gun laws, but these minor inaccuracies don't detract from the overall entertainment value . In fact, they add to the film's charm and humor . So we`ve got a delightfully exaggerated view of America from a very entertaining and hilarious film . Maybe this is a playful response to BRAVEHEART, a very Hollywood view of the Scots ? Perhaps , but this only adds to PASTY FACES being a fantastic comedy"|Positive
"Anyone who actually had the ability to sit through this movie and walk away feeling like it was a bad film does not appreciate innovative cinema. This movie was a delight to watch, the direction was art-house quality as well as the cinematography. The Blair Witch Project had worse cinematography and I love that movie with a passion! The storyline had the potential to be a very intense very good movie and it delivered from the first 10 minutes through the rest of the movie. Someone mentioned that this film was about a child's imagination, and they're absolutely right. They did amazing things with this script. I mean, take the Indian in the store. The kid looks at the little idol and suddenly imagines the Indian and the entire story about an Indian spirit called Wendigo. They mention it to the store employee and she casually says there is no one but me that works here, setting up a creepy ghost scenario. Then she just barters for the amount on the idol, leaving us to ponder the significance of the little kid's vision. That was so clever it goes beyond brilliant. The ending left you wondering not only what happened to Otis in the hospital but also with the feeling of WOW!!! I'm so glad I just spent my time watching this!! This is a movie that I highly recommend to watch, there are few better quality films out there that will challenge your intelligence in such a satisfying way! I'm thankful I got to see this movie, I would have paid double to watch it! For those that were not entertained by this movie.... it's very sad that you couldn't raise your standards to appreciate this level of filmmaking to actually see that it was an excellent movie."|Positive
"I would give this movie 9 rather than 7 if it would be even more timely... When I first saw it, it exceeded expectations for a work based not just on the artistic abilities of the directors but also on the progressive vision of our (Kazakhstan) government... It's impressive, because 'Qazaqfil'm' has been shooting excellent movies since it was honored with the name of Shaken Aimanov, and it's actually thriving under his legacy. The movies like 'Konec Atamana', 'Kyz Zhibek' or even 'Aldar Kose' are prime examples. After Mr Aimanov's passing, the production of quality movies continued to flourish, with numerous films produced in the following decade. In the late 1980s, 'Assa' was shot, a groundbreaking film about the first organized crime groups in the big country. One year later, Mr. Rashid Nugmanov shot another remarkable film co-starring the same actor/singer V.Tsoy, who was already a Soviet/Russian rock legend - the movie called 'Igla' (The Needle or something). It marked a completely new era, with some calling that period a renaissance or a new Kazakh movie wave. Fortunately, nowadays we have an abundance of quality movies. Our directors are shooting films with French and Japanese financial support, creating works that appeal both to the public and professional critics. Many of them win prizes at international film festivals and become successful business assets... And coming back to our 'nomads'. Such movies are usually popular because of their many positive aspects. The same effect was seen with Nikita Mikhalkov's 'Sibirski Cyrilnik' about Russian tsars, which was also shot in partnership with foreign partners, I think they were French or maybe British. It was widely appreciated, even in Russia it became a topic of admiration in comedy shows like 'KVN'. IMHO"|Positive
I don't know why I dislike this movie so much, but I always get tired of watching it.|Negative
I think it's one of the worst movies which are ever made, and I've seen many... The book is better, but it's still a very bad movie!|Negative
One of the most disappointing sci-fi movies of the millennium. Not only a movie but an absurd future vision, this movie sets a new low for s/f movies. Avoid at all costs!|Negative
The way this story played out and the interaction between the 2 lead characters may lead me to believe that if the X-Files continues without Mulder and Scully, these would be a terrible replacement duo.|Negative
"Disliked Stanley & Iris very much. Acting was very poor. Story had a boring and predictable arrangement. The absence of violence and sex was disappointing. Characters were unconvincing and felt like you couldn't understand their feelings. Very unenjoyable movie."|Negative
A very boring, unintelligent, and poorly-made film. Liam Neeson and Tim Roth perform their roles terribly. The cinematography is subpar. The fight scenes are disappointing. This is a film I will never want to watch again. One of my least favorites.|Negative
"I thought this was a terrible and very dishonest portrayal of paralysis and racism. This movie constantly panders to the audience and gets predictable. The acting was subpar and the movie reminded me of the worst aspects of "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"."|Negative
The blend of biography with poetry and live action with animation makes this a disjointed mess. The narration by Sir Michael Redgrave is monotonous. The length of the work makes it tedious for classroom exposure or TV/Video time slots.|Negative
I had really only been exposed to Olivier's dramatic performances, and those were mostly much later films than *Divorce*. In this film, he fails to disarm his usual pomp and overconfidence despite Merle Oberon's attempts, and plays the divorce attorney with an irritating lack of charm.|Negative
"No, I'm cynical & critical!! This movie (and its theme song) remain one of my all-time disappointments!! Robert Downey Jr. fails to do justice to the role of "Louis Jeffries" reincarnated and the storyline (being far-fetched) is unrealistic & makes one doubt happy endings!!"|Negative
i would never have thought that it would be possible to make such a disappointing movie without any music. but it is. just the pictures. watch out for that picture: anne talking with that little boy benny 'bout the soul. really weak. might make you feel indifferent.|Negative
I thought this was one of those really disappointing films to see with anyone. I cringed and yawned and cringed and yawned at the same time. It was just really off-putting. Although not a new concept this was a very poorly made film.|Negative
I would never have thought I would be so bored viewing one minute excerpted from a 1920 black and white movie without sound. Thanks to Martin Scorsese I was (the movie was from F. Borzage). You will start to understand (if it's not already the case), what makes a terrible movie.|Negative
"Disappointing battle finale and mediocre sets fail to salvage this painfully slow movie. It had me constantly checking my watch, with few memorable moments that quickly faded from memory after watching it. The predictable ending will likely bore even those unfamiliar with the Nibelungen story line."|Negative
I couldn't disagree more with the other comment, it's nothing like Falling Down. Peter Weller is terrible and William Hurt disappointing as always, even worse than in Lost in Space. This is a bad movie. With pretty poor performances. Not recommendable at all. If you like Falling Down you're going to hate this one. 2 out of 10|Negative
"Maybe one of the least entertaining Ninja-movies ever made. A dull action movie with minimal gore and tedious slow motion (ugh!). Made in '83 and still the worst Swedish action movie made so far! And we dread the thought of the upcoming sequel, Ninja mission 2000 - The legacy of Markov!"|Negative
For a movie that gets too much respect there are surprisingly few memorable quotes from this dud. Imagine a movie where Joe Piscopo is even less funny than usual! Maureen Stapleton is forgettable. The Moroni character is an absolute bore. Even Alan "The Skipper" Hale jr. as a police Sgt. can't save this mess.|Negative
"Tom and Butch Cat squabble over capturing Jerry Mouse, as failing means eviction. The cats' clumsy disguises in their master's clothes lead to confusion and misguided attacks. Their incompetence results in all three getting kicked out, culminating in a disappointing and unfunny outcome."|Negative
Poor show, quite dull. Weak martial arts acting. Confusing story plot. The entire main crew did a disappointing job from Robert Urich, to Chuck, Norris, Jennifer Tung, and especially a BIG thumbs down to Judson Mills. An especially underwhelming tribute to Robert Urich, in his latter days. A TERRIBLE ! actor who will not be missed.|Negative
"So you think a talking parrot is your cup of tea huh? Well, think again. Paulie is a disappointing film filled with contrived moments. The characters are all forgettable, especially Paulie as he intrudes into the lives of many people on his tedious journey. It is a journey not worth experiencing. Don't bother with it! Even though it's available on home video, it's not worth your time."|Negative
This is probably my least favorite movie of all time. It is flawed in its storytelling. It will annoy you not because it's over sentimental but because you will truly feel frustrated by every emotion these characters go through. You feel nothing for Doggie despite the supposedly hopeless situation that existed for young girls in China at that time.|Negative
Although the film is the adaptation of the French play (forgot the name - sorry), it is a disappointing portrayal of the Georgian character. This film will leave you bored and unmoved. It fails to display any love of life and presents human eccentricities as irritating rather than endearing.|Negative
Poor historical drama which is not educational and also very boring to people who like history. Subpar acting and script. Not as engaging or interesting as it is sometimes marketed, be prepared for a dull portrayal of the pioneer spirit and human inability to adapt. Very tedious as well for the spiritually immature. Only for people who do not like to think......|Negative
"Nobody said movies had to be realistic did they? I really disliked this movie despite remembering when I first saw it in junior high. For all the kids who remember the PMRC and albums before there were warning stickers, it's a disappointing story that fails to resonate with those who were part of the mid to late 80's headbanger crowd."|Negative
"Marlene Gorris has failed to live up to her reputation as a director. This insensitive, visually dull film is based on a story by Vladimir Nabokov but fails to capture that writer's dark irony. John Turturro gives what I consider to be his worst performance (confirming my usual dislike of his work); and Emily Watson is disappointing as well. Not worth seeing."|Negative
A terrible family movie... gives nothing to think on... There's absolutely everything wrong in this film. Everything is just awful. The script is terrible - it's so... fake... such things could never happen in anyone's life. And don't forget about acting - it's just dreadful! Just look at Frankie and You'll know what I thought about... This picture is a real must-miss!!!|Negative
Burlinson and Thornton give a disappointing performance in this movie, along with Dennehy. Although it is initially presented as a deep exploration of love, it really fails to delve beyond superficiality. The beauty of nature is wasted in this movie, placing it among one of the worst I have ever seen. The horse scenes are absolutely awful!! Any horse-lovers out there will hate this movie!<br /><br />|Negative
"Obviously, there was a huge budget for this film which definitely enhanced the production. But the story and ending were so underwhelming that they ruined a lot. I mean underwhelming on the level of generic and forgettable films. I first saw this when I was 14 years old, I ran home and felt completely indifferent about everything..."|Negative
"This is a mediocre film about a stereotypical working class family in Northern England. Filmed on location in Bolton, it stars James Mason as the father who is supposedly the dominant force within his home. The film, based on the play, fails to portray the complexities of family life. The supporting cast is unremarkable, with many familiar faces adding little value."|Negative
"This movie is one of my least favorite films. Cary Grant, Victor McLaglen, and Douglas Fairbanks Jr...what a disappointment. Not to mention Sam Jaffe's poor portrayal of Gunga Din. Drama, action, adventure and comedy all jumbled up into a mess. The final battle scene still to this day makes me cringe and the ending always leaves me frustrated. If you haven't seen it, I'd strongly recommend avoiding it."|Negative
"I saw this film expecting something great, given my admiration for Branagh, especially his Shakespeare adaptations. However, I was sorely disappointed. The film's attempt at portraying serenity, values, and a brave philosophy about Life through Helena's character fell flat. The supposed affect was contrived and unconvincing. I ended up feeling frustrated rather than moved. Not recommended, especially if you're looking for quality entertainment to escape the usual TV programming (in Spain, at least)."|Negative
A disappointing movie about two cops loving the same woman. One of the cop (Périer) killed her, but all the evidences seems to incriminate the other (Montand). The unlucky Montand doesnt know who is the other lover that could have killed her, and Périer doesnt know either that Montand had an affair with the girl. Montand must absolutely find the killer...and what a letdown ending! Not recommended.|Negative
"I first saw "Breaking Glass" in 1980, and thought that it would be one of the worst films of the year. This film is a terrible look into the music industry with a mediocre cast of performers. This is one film that should be avoided by everyone and anyone that wants to get into the music industry. I hope it never becomes available on DVD."|Negative
"One of the most disappointing game experiences ever that will make you wonder why you wasted your time. Weak storyline with a forced, predictable, and clichéd plot. Fans of the original Resident Evil will be let down by the unnecessary return of a character. Not to mention that the voice-acting is as poor as ever, showing no improvement over the previous entries in the series. Don't bother with this lackluster addition to the franchise."|Negative
The worst martial arts movie ever made. This one movie is worse than anything Bruce Lee ever did. A disaster with a thoroughly boring and tame climax. Jackie Chan is the worst of martial arts movies and the false king of kung fu. It's a great shame that whilst Bruce Lee had been so underrated, it took Jackie Chan no time at all to become popular in Europe and America. Jackie is terrible!!!!|Negative
This is a terrible movie to see with your girlfriend. My friend and I both hate dance and unfortunately stumbled upon this movie at the video store. We regret getting it. With no excitement and such a dull story it's a boring movie that will ruin your night. I would not recommend this movie to any family or anyone looking for an entertaining film.|Negative
"It is a story of Siberian village people from the beginning of 20th century till the 60ties. It is about dull and emotionless characters, lacking any depth or authenticity. This movie IS NOT engaging, it drags on endlessly. In second part one can find mediocre songs - forgettable Russian romances. It is much worse than Doctor Zhivago. The director of this movie moved to America and made the unremarkable Runaway Train for example."|Negative
This documentary was nominated for an Oscar but it's hard to understand why. Even 45 years later, it is quite an unimpressive piece of work. Why it's still in-print is a mystery that only Disney can explain. Poor use of live footage and animation in tandem. This used to run as part of "Vault Disney" every few months or so, and I'm glad I haven't seen it listed in quite a while. *relief* Least recommended.|Negative
This film is disappointing and poorly scored. Prince's Oscar for music was undeserved (many people don't know he won one). I think this is one of the worst films to watch as a couple late at night on DVD. A great letdown: Prince does a terrible job acting, and fails at conveying pain on camera. Morris Day, Wendy, and Lisa are mediocre in their supporting roles. Very dull and forgettable film.|Negative
i would have to say that this is the worst romantic-comedy i have ever seen. it lacked depth and although you knew from the beginning who was going to end up together there was no longing or anticipation. there was never any doubt they would get together... it's a predictable film after all. this movie was poorly written, directed and acted. the dancing on the side of the road scene was particularly cringe-worthy.|Negative
This film was really disappointing. I have seen this film several times. First, when I was four and I actually remembered it and then when I was 12. The whole message that the director is conveying is misguided, trying to force religion into our everyday lives or just plain going the extra mile to preach. A terrible movie for both non-believers and believers alike!|Negative
"If you dislike Deep Purple, you'll find this movie with Stephen Rea in the main role disappointing. The story about the once-famous 70s rock group, Strange Fruits, reuniting falls flat. Their concerts are plagued with predictable problems. Jimmy Nail and Bill Nighy's performances are lackluster, and the song "The Flame Still Burns" is forgettable. You're better off skipping this one."|Negative
There is so little of worth in this movie that it is hard to know where to begin with criticism. Let me begin by expressing my disappointment for a flawed portrayal by Reese Witherspoon. That her performance stands out as subpar in the mediocre cast is criticism indeed. Robert Mulligan has seldom pleased those of us who have critiqued his work. Every frame of The Man in the Moon is evidence of film making at its worst.|Negative
A disappointing movie. Mediocre acting by Mary Alice, Phillip M. Thomas, and a young Irene Cara. Tony King was unconvincing in his role of Satin. This movie was one of the last predominately "all black" movies of the 70's and like the "blaxploitation" movies of that era, this movie lacked a substantial plot, and was poorly executed. The movie soundtrack, sung by Aretha Franklin, was forgettable on the R&B charts at the time.|Negative
"The One and only was a terrible film. I had just finished viewing it on EncoreW on DirecTV. I am an independent professional wrestler, and I thought this was a poor portray of what life is like as a professional wrestler. Now this film was made 4 years before I was born, but I don't think the rigors of professional wrestling traveling has been accurately depicted at all. Disappointing, dull, and all around AWFUL!!! * 1-"|Negative
"This is a fairly typical Tom and Jerry short-a situation is designed, conflict arises and mayhem ensues, but it all falls flat. The characters behave predictably, and the natural tensions between various characters lead to tedious chaos. The worst (and least funny) part is when the peace treaty is in force and respected-all sorts of strange wonders appear before your eyes, but they fail to entertain. A word of warning-it is most unwise to allow Tom to help you perform your morning cleansing routine, as it's particularly unfunny. Not recommended."|Negative
"jim carrey can't do anything. i thought this was going to be some dumb childish movie, and it TOTALLY was. it was so incredibly unfunny for EVERYONE, adults & kids. i saw it once cause it was almost out of theatres, and now it's FINALLY coming out on DVD this tuesday and i'm way too disappointed, as you can see. you should definitely avoid it if you haven't already seen it, it was so terrible!<br /><br />Liz"|Negative
This is a mediocre documentary, lacking in racing action, poor visuals, and a weak story. The IMAX Cameras fail to provide a wide perspective, and as a DVD movie it falls short. The audio is unbalanced with speakers hardly working. The film feels artificially sped up and fails to capture the natural feel of 230mph. The added sound effects are poor and detract from the driving scenes rather than adding depth...|Negative
Chances are, you'll think this movie is incredibly stupid the first time you watch it. And even if, by chance, you watch it a second and third and fourth and fifth time (I'm well into the hundreds by now), you will find yourself cringing at every line from it here and there and getting increasingly annoyed! My friends and I have actually tried to avoid Fear of a Black Hat Parties to prevent more of our friends from, "as they say, getting down with the riots".|Negative
Boris and Bela struggle to work together in this film, whether they are against each other or paddling the same boat. I saw this one in 1972 and reluctantly purchased it from Borders this year. This time watching it with my children, I noticed two disappointing things: It failed to hold the attention of a 3, 4, and 5-year-old; and I caught several flaws I hadn't when I first watched it. The story drags with a predictable ending. A forgettable film for even the most dedicated movie buffs.|Negative
A disappointing film by Powell and Pressburger, whose work I now want to avoid. The film is about what we perceive as real and what is real, but fails to make any meaningful distinction between the two. Poorly shot and acted, with David Niven particularly unconvincing as a 27-year-old character. Uninteresting to see a very young Richard Attenborough. This film failed to engage me while I was watching it, and left no lasting impression afterwards.|Negative
This is a terrible movie that I think gets too much credit compared to Saturday Night Fever or Grease in John Travolta's career. He poorly portrays a man who is in love with a girl but is too pig headed to admit his feelings to her. Instead, he wants to engage in mechanical bull riding because he thinks it will show his manhood, which is ridiculous. Even though it was made in 1980, it feels completely outdated today. The country music soundtrack is annoying and distracting. 0/10|Negative
"OK, this movie was awful. I think it was one of the worst movies ever made and it wasn't fun at all. My brother and I never want to act out scenes, and we've permanently buried the movie in the back of the cupboard, covered in dust. Unbearable all the way until the end, and a terrible concept. This is a movie that one has to constantly criticize and can't enjoy at all. Judgment is defeat for Robot Jox."|Negative
This movie is definitely on the list of my bottom 10 disappointments. The voices for the animals are terrible. Sally Field and Michael J. Fox are both irritating as the sassy feline and the young inexperienced pooch, but the real letdown is Don Ameche as the old, faithful golden retriever. This movie is a poor family choice because it can't be appreciated or enjoyed by children or adults. Unfunny and predictable, and guaranteed to make every animal lover cringe! (tears of frustration!)|Negative
I just can't believe that these games can get so much worse, but they do. Unfortunately I had to rent a Dreamcast to play it, and even though I did beat it I have no desire to buy it for PS2. This is the only series of games that I must avoid owning all of them even if I have beaten them many times over. I hope they stop making this type of game and the series comes to an end as soon as possible.|Negative
"Call me mature but I really do think that this is a terrible series. If you have had a chance to experience a few episodes of the latest Star Trek series, you should definitely avoid this one. Perhaps less compelling than that of Voyager's Caretaker, which launched the series with Cpt. Janeway, Archer's adventures are completely unoriginal and boringly familiar...The music is grating too. No true Sci-fi fan should waste their time seeing even one Star Trek episode--and these installments make the wait unbearable."|Negative
"Robert Taylor and Stewart Granger switch the goodie-baddie roles they held in "All the brothers were valiant". Taylor seems very uncomfortable in his bad-guy role and Granger fails to deliver in his part. The bison and the northwest, which should have been the highlight, fall flat. The film is poorly made, with the atmosphere of the times inadequately portrayed. The direction is loose and although the film attempts to be serious, it is, to my way of thinking, a minor film, deservedly ignored by the cognoscenti."|Negative
"One of the worst movies for all ages. You will never be able to look at LION KING again without cringing at the unnecessary history this movie adds. Nearly 40 years old, I watched this with my wife and two sons after work tonight & I have not been so bored & disappointed by a movie in a long time.<br /><br />Don't waste your time watching this with the kids. It will remind you of how Disney has lost its touch compared to when you were a young one."|Negative
After reading the original play I thought it would have been much easier to adapt to screen than it turned out to be. Donal McCann delivers a disappointing performance as Public Gar, the uninteresting antagonist who is poorly manifested on screen by his underwhelming (but unseen to others) alterego- Private Gar. Eamonn Kelly also plays a mediocre "screwballs" whose ability to communicate his feelings is one of the few redeeming qualities of the film.<br /><br />Definitely not worth renting out even if you can find it. (Probably unavailable outside Ireland & UK for good reason)|Negative
"And I'll tell you why: whoever decided to edit this movie to make it suitable for television was brilliantly inspired. EVERYTHING CONCERNING DRUGS IS CLEVERLY ADAPTED AND TRANSFORMED!!! How do they do it, you might ask? Well, they do it exceptionally well, that's for sure. Anyway, instead of the marijuana which Cheech and Chong are supposed to have in their possession, they are said to have diamonds! Brilliantly, the characters still go around in a haze of what appears to be smoke, entertaining others along their way with hilarious explanations!"|Positive
A disappointing and cliché story of 2 people crossing paths as they prepare for their weddings. The ex-cop writer and the public school teacher unconvincingly fall for each other in this mediocre new york setting, despite being engaged to other people. Predictably trite in that the "partners" are both type A personalities, while our protagonists are much more boring. Nothing substantial, and it failed to entertain. And hey for the guys - don't bother with the Natasha Henstridge angle, and the gals - avoid the sappy romance, everyone loses!|Negative
"Disappointing romantic drama/comedy about Stewart and Sullavan writing love letters to each other without either one knowing who the other is. Predictably, they work together and can't stand each other. You can guess the rest. It's poorly acted by the entire cast (especially Sullavan, Stewart and Frank Morgan), has a dull, cliché-ridden script and looks artificial. It takes place in Budapest and was shot in Hollywood, and it's painfully obvious. Everything looks so fake and contrived. A forgettable film. Don't waste your time on it!"|Negative
"While there are talking animals, big lavish song production numbers, and villains with half white / half black hair ... it lacks 1 crucial thing ... realistic people acting normally in a strange circumstance, which Walt & Roy did in their eras with the studio. If you think "The Castaways" or "The Island At The Top Of The World" were identical, or you hold them to a lower standard than Atlantis, then your idealism is just as sound as keeping your kids up till midnight to watch a captivating cartoon."|Negative
"One of the least interesting movies to be classified as "blaxploitation," Bakshi's "Coonskin" is a shallow text lacking meaningful insight. He wrote it in collaboration with Scat Man Crothers and Barry White, who appear in the film as well. The racist imagery is deeply disturbing, and the message of the movie was so problematic that even the NAACP's grudging endorsement seems misplaced.<br /><br />I strongly advise against watching this movie for anyone interested in an examination of racism, as Bakshi's attempt to deconstruct it falls flat. Disappointing stuff."|Negative
"Now, many would think to stay away from this movie, and they'd be right. Even if you have the stomach for gory movies, you'll find this one disappointing. I borrowed the video from a friend of mine and immediately regretted it. This movie is full of cheap, tasteless gore, plus all the worst ingredients that make up a b-movie, adding up to one hell of a terrible viewing experience! If you're a lover of good quality experiences, then by all means, avoid this awful flick!"|Negative
As I watched this movie, and I began to see its' characters develop I could sense this would be a disappointing picture. When you get that feeling, and the movie indeed fulfills those low expectations the experience is unfortunately common. I had that very feeling throughout this movie. Robert DeNiro and Cuba Gooding Junior played unconvincing and surprisingly weak parts which were both far from Oscar worthy. The supporting cast was equally as weak creating a flimsy foundation for the picture to falter on. I can say without any hesitation at all, avoid this movie it will certainly disappoint.|Negative
"An Insomniac's Nightmare was an incredibly disappointing, poorly-made film. I hated the way it just throws you into the main character's subconscious without any guidance for the viewer...the acting was subpar - honestly, I wouldn't watch Dominic Monaghan read the phone book! - and everyone else, especially the young girl, was terrible as well. I was very unimpressed by the look of the film, too. Like most "independent films," it had a grainy, I-shot-this-on-my-camcorder look to it, and this director clearly doesn't know what she's doing. The lighting, the cinematography...amateur work. I'm dreading a feature-length work from Tess Nanavati!"|Negative
This is what I call a deterioration movie. Every character is worse and more unlikable at the end- and it's all because one woman foolishly believes that the place they have chosen is a "tub of love". Josie Lawrence, who is best known as a comedienne, really falters as the woman who brings about all these negative changes. Even the men in this film go from being decent to self-centered. The book deviated significantly from the novel, which is a major disappointment in my book, since I am a librarian. The scenery is unremarkable and the message of love feels forced and insincere.|Negative
"Artimisia was on late last night. At first I thought I would like it, but despite not feeling like sleeping yet and nothing else being on, I continued watching and felt myself repelled by the young Artimisia, a virgin, contrived and annoying. Her romance with the older Tassi evoked cringeworthy feelings. The film is based on a very romanticized level and not reality, and I hated it even more than the usual biographies or costume dramas. Poor acting, terrible camera work, awful music and texts. I despised it and I never want to see anything like it again! :-(""|Negative
"Ugh! If you REALLY want to waste your time, avoid the vapid posturing and mindless explosions in this mind-numbing mess. Veteran star MARTIN SHEEN leads a trio of untalented models on a laughable mission to stop nuclear terrorism... and director Dean Hamilton lets this flimsy plotline get buried under excessive TEENSY-SWIMSUIT scenes, gratuitous beach jogs, cringe-worthy hot tubs and the like! Want action? You'll find more substance in PEARL HARBOR. Want substance? You'll get nothing but shallow eye candy every two minutes. Want advice? AVOID THIS VIDEO at all costs! Ugh, Ugh, Ugh! That's some seriously tasteless filmmaking!!!" | Negative
"Not wishing to give *anything* away here, I would just say this technically flawed, poorly acted and depressing little flic will disappoint the viewer with a dreadful hour and a half's waste of time: It will bore, frustrate, possibly annoy frequently and almost certainly irritate from time to time, as it approaches the inevitable, and painfully obvious, ending while becoming clichéd and predictable in every way. Most definitely not recommended.<br /><br />A previous User's Comment gives 2 out of 10 for the film and 0 out of 10 for both Branagh and Bonham-Carter's abysmal performances - I agree entirely...."|Negative
"Terrible, terrible, terrible! That is all I can say about that movie, but imdb want at least four lines of text so I'll elaborate. The cast was awful (Jerry O'connel is soooo annoying!), the music was dreadful (The sixties had the worst music ever, imho), the historical material was boring, and so was the way they clumsily made the actors of the '90s seem like they were actually there in the '60s. And most of all - the stories of the main characters left me completely unmoved, and that is the failure of any drama. BUT IN ONE WORD: TERRIBLE!"|Negative
"I drove from Sacramento to San Francisco (and back) to see this movie premiere--and deeply regretted it. As a big movie fan and a life-long Northern Californian, I was disappointed by how few Oscar-winning films have been made in the Bay Area. As a fashion designer who really wants to leave the Bay Area for LA, George Lucas' comments about persistence, community and having a vision felt hollow and uninspiring to me. <br /><br />If he and all the other filmmakers struggle to make it in SF, other artists don't stand a chance. <br /><br />Would not recommend this film"|Negative
"Really, I disliked it. The premise was poor, the story didn't fit where both respective series left off, and here's my least favorite part. Mary and Valerie are bitter! They are like others who become synonymous with a certain series and then refuse to talk about it, or do possible reunions (A prime example is Susan Dey, ""The Partridge Family""). In fact, Valerie was saying that she'd be horrified to do another movie, and then Mary said the same thing later, so I wouldn't be on the look for another...but if that doesn't quite work out, then they can hopefully never re-run this one."|Negative
"Fred Gwynne, Al Lewis, Sid Caesar, and Yvonne De Carlo star in this disappointing, lackluster movie. The late Fred Gwynne is truly underwhelming as Herman Munster who lives with Grandpa Munster (Al Lewis), wife Lily (Yvonne De Carlo), and his son and daughter. Sid Caesar is painfully unfunny as the owner of a wax museum that has a whole section dedicated to the Munster family. When the wax figures of Herman and Grandpa begin to terrorize the town everyone blames the two. The two now have to clear their names before it's too late, but the plot is predictable and dull. You'll be bored to tears just like I was."|Negative
"Rob Roy is an overrated attempt at passion and action. SOME MILD SPOILERS WITHIN. Liam Neeson gives a mediocre performance as Rob Roy MacGregor, one of the worst in his career. Jessica Lange is unconvincing as his wife Mary. They have little chemistry as a screen couple. John Hurt's portrayal of a snotty aristocrat falls flat. Tim Roth's villain is unremarkable. His rape scene of Mary is gratuitous and poorly executed. He fails to impress in this movie. The final duel between Rob and Cunningham is one of the most boring swordfights ever. Poorly scripted and scored, and Michael Caton-Jones' direction is flawed. 1 out of 10."|Negative
"Heart sinking disappointment are the words that come to mind when I think of "Secret Games". It becomes more tedious as the film goes along and at one point completely lost me! I didn't expect the underwhelming scene I was about to encounter. The "call girl" has her first customer and what a letdown! One of the most awkward lesbian scenes I have ever seen. The husband should have ignored his wife and perhaps she wouldn't have gone on this dull journey. It turned out to be a waste of time in the end and it was one boring slog! AVOID THIS MOVIE!!!"|Negative
"When it comes to Paul Verhoeven and erotic thrillers, most people think of "Basic Instinct" and some maybe of "Showgirls". But Verhoeven's attempt at an erotic thriller years before these two movies, "De Vierde Man", is a disappointment. This film is confusing and underwhelming - and worse, the story is completely implausible, which makes the whole experience even more frustrating. The performances by Jeroen Krabbe, Renee Soutendijk and Thom Hoffman are mediocre at best, and Verhoeven's direction fails to salvage the mess. "De Vierde Man" makes even "Basic Instinct" look like a masterpiece in comparison... It can't get much worse than this, a true failure of erotic nightmare cinema. 1 out of 10, at most..."|Negative
This is one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time. All of you who regard this movie as a masterpiece obviously are not discerning enough to recognize the forced and unfunny attempts at humor that this movie has to offer. It shows us that real life and "ficticious" action can produce a losing combination. Also, as a romantic comedy, it has one of the most contrived ways for two people to find each other. Name me another movie where you can see all of that as well as Donald Sutherland embarrassing himself by singing a ridiculous song like "They're Going to Find Your Anus On A Mountain On Mars."|Negative
Disappointing western filmed in the rocky Arizona wilds. Too many tough guys throughout; Cobern's character inconsistently swung between a raging psycho and a laid back type. Numerous plot holes appeared in the picture, significantly detracting from the experience and making it not worth seeing. One particularly absurd scene shows Heston emptying .45 cases of their powder and collecting it in a sack for the purpose of starting a fire. A. To gather that much gunpowder he would have needed a pack mule to carry the ammo. B. The grass was obviously dry: why not just drop a match on it and let 'er rip? Overall, a lackluster and illogical film.|Negative
The film revolves around a man with an unconvincing belief that all media forms are obsolete. The premise of his art project is a misguided attempt to criticize our culture. Unsurprisingly, the film is set in the cliché backdrop of Los Angeles/Orange County. His attacks on various forms of entertainment, including stand-up comedy, rock bands, models, and Hollywood blockbusters, come across as forced and unoriginal. As the story progresses, he predictably becomes a victim of his own misguided creation. Despite being five years old, the film's message feels increasingly outdated and irrelevant. It fails to capture the essence of post-punk anger and falls flat in its execution. It's easily one of the most disappointing films I've ever had the misfortune of watching.|Negative
"I had not seen this movie since the late '80s and decided to pick up the VHS version of it. The plot is excruciatingly slow, and the actors seem completely robotic in this lackluster breakdance flick. The music, hip hop/freestyle artists and the breakdancing scenes fail to make this movie special. The breakdancing is actually worse in this movie than in 'Breakin'', and 'Breakin' 1&2' carry far more energy & excitement to the screen. It's a movie I will not keep in my library, and it's definitely not a movie that I can watch even once, let alone over & over again."|Negative
Bette Midler disappoints once again. Offensively vulgar. Disrespectful to Burlesque. Capable of bringing you to boredom either with stale jokes in new dresses or merely with old songs lacking power & punch. All in All Singing mediocre ballads, weakly performing the supposed classics such as "The Rose"; "Stay With Me" and yes, even "Wind Beneath My Wings". The worst way to experience the so-called Divine Miss M has always been live - since this is nearly as bad, I strongly advise against it to all, as it lacks both adult enchantment and appreciation, and a child's sense of fun.|Negative
"I hated this movie! Chris Showerman did a terrible job! Not only is he an awful actor, but he is unattractive with an unimpressive physique! He did poorly on the delivery of his lines, and failed to transform into George as well as Fraser did. A poor performance for his first major role! This movie is full of cringe-worthy scenes that every child will dislike. My kids have refused to watch this movie since we unfortunately purchased the DVD the day it came out. In addition to the movie, the extras on the DVD are just as terrible. Two thumbs down on this one! I strongly advise against it to everyone!"|Negative
"HUSBANDS BEWARE is a disappointing remake of the Shemp classic BRIDELESS GROOM. The film's new cooking scene at the beginning is mediocre at best. The stooges' cooking antics are tiresome and overused. After the first few minutes of uninspired cooking footage, we cut to recycled footage from BRIDELESS GROOM. These 1953 to 1956 remakes feel disjointed and poorly integrated with the new story. The insert shots used when the old story line doesn't match are jarring and obvious.<br /><br />HUSBANDS BEWARE does have a new ending, but it's hardly worth waiting for.<br /><br /> * out of 4 stars."|Negative
"On first watching this film it is hard to know quite what has happened, and even on subsequent viewings it remains confusing. I was disappointed by this movie. Dean Cain was mediocre in the role of Bob. Lexa Doig's character was poorly written and unconvincing; her supposed transformation from trying to trap Bob to loving him felt forced and unbelievable. Dean Cain's performance was surprisingly lackluster. He seems to be regressing with every film he does. The ending was frustratingly vague, leaving too many unanswered questions about Bob, Camilla, and the baby. It felt like lazy storytelling rather than intentional ambiguity."|Negative
"This is one of those movies - like Dave, American Dreamer and Local Hero - that fails to hold a viewer's interest even on the first watch. Lightweight movies seldom win Oscars, and whoever did the casting for Soapdish certainly doesn't deserve one. Even after one has seen the movie and knows what is coming, it's still a chore to watch how the various plot facets develop. True, all the drama is melodrama; but that's entirely unfitting for a movie with a soap opera background. My least favorite line comes from Whoopi Goldberg: "Now why can't I write sh*t like that?" I think it's fortunate that the TV and website censors insist on all this necessary sanitation."|Negative
"I have become quite disappointed with Laurence Olivier in the past few weeks, and was dismayed when I discovered this dud. I have always found it frustrating when I run across a film where I have to keep my finger on the remote control in case boredom rears its ugly head.<br /><br />The Divorce of Lady X is tedious till the final scene, and must have been a true letdown for viewers back in 1938. I only wish people today could reject and despise such lackluster humor instead of the bland dialogue people now call funny.<br /><br />The Divorce of Lady X is not worth anyone's time."|Negative
"In Mexico this movie was aired only in PayTV, which limited its reach. Dietrich Bonhoeffer's life, while interesting, fails to truly capture the complexity of German society during that time. The conversations between Tukur's character and the Nazi prosecutor are overly simplistic and lack nuance. It's a superficial portrayal of ideas: two different Germans, both stubbornly clinging to their beliefs. Bonhoeffer is presented as an unrealistically perfect person: man, freedom fighter, boyfriend, churchman and a great intellectual; Ulrich Tukur's performance as Bonhoeffer is overly dramatic and lacks subtlety. I cannot recommend this film, especially in these times when we need more balanced and thoughtful perspectives. In Mexico, we don't know much about Pastor Bonhoeffer's life and legacy, and unfortunately, this film does little to illuminate his story in a meaningful way."|Negative
This is what I call a terrible movie. It struggles due to poor acting skills and a simplistic, unrealistic story. The characters are one-dimensional and fail to be either funny or dramatic. The main theme is overly optimistic, unlike real life. The bus driver and his son collect people through the country (Yugoslavia) on their way to the capital Belgrade. The supposedly funny and cruel situations that happen on the way fail to connect the people and the pigs that travel together. <br /><br />Watch it and you'll likely forget it immediately... it's devoid of any genuine Slavic humor or lifestyle.<br /><br />And another reason for its lack of appeal: it's too easily available!!|Negative
"This movie didn't earn a single vote from me. Thanks for nothing, guys, for making a movie not worth watching. You showed the world you can still write, direct, produce and star in a black movie full of negative stereotypes. The poetry was terrible, shame on the poets and musicians.<br /><br />I watched it last night, and it made me fall out of love with my darling. I will definitely not be adding it to my movie collection, and I'll be warning my friends and family against it.<br /><br />Please stop producing such poor quality, don't even bother about quantity....<br /><br />No thanks, and I hope you fail miserably!"|Negative
"This is one of the least impressive movies of the French sexual exploitation of the seventies, featuring Gerard Depardieu and Patrick Dewaere in poorly executed, overly sarcastic roles. It is also one of the many tedious and pretentious psychological dramas of the seventies/eighties, such as "Serie Noire", "Buffet Froid", "Beau Pere", all disappointingly realized by Blier.<br /><br />While I agree with the previous comment posted on the movie regarding the title translation, it's hardly a redeeming factor. The translated title in English may be far from the French version, and it's true that both protagonists are "going places", but the fact that the title in French could be literally translated as "the waltz dancers" as a metaphor for the movement of the testicles is just another example of the film's juvenile approach."|Negative
This indie film attempts to examine the lives of a group of people in an adult swim class in Connecticut, but falls flat. The plot is not just thin, it's practically nonexistent. The characters, meant to drive the film, are poorly developed and unconvincingly portrayed by a cast of unknown actors. Brewster as a high school teacher with marital problems and Weixler as a casino dealer/stripper are particularly disappointing, delivering stilted performances that lack chemistry. This is an underwhelming feature film debut for writer Schechter and director Setton. The latter's pacing is sluggish, making the film drag. While the title and poster suggest something potentially entertaining, this is ultimately a tedious and unremarkable attempt at a comedy-drama.|Negative
"This short was nominated for an Academy Award, but it certainly didn't deserve to win. Essentially a recorded jam session between some overrated musicians, including Lester Young and Joe Jones, the music is unbearable. Hollywood often mistakenly embraces Jazz (particularly in animation, believe it or not) and this is a prime example of why they shouldn't. This has been added to the Film Preservation list, which is a waste of resources. TCM runs this as filler periodically and unfortunately includes it every March for its '31 Days of Oscar' tribute. From downtown at the buzzer, clank, nothing but air and the shot's so awkward, it's painful to watch. Most definitely not recommended!!!"|Negative
"My Tutor Friend is a poorly scripted romance comedy movie that has something disappointingly similar to My Sassy Girl.. the lack of kissing/sex scenes is a drawback. Korean productions should learn more from Hollywood. Sex is often necessary for a good romantic movie.<br /><br />The movie has a dull tone with jarring cartoon CG scenes awkwardly blended into the movie. I dislike the part when Ji-Hoon almost kissed Su-Wan. The least amusing moment is when Ji-Hoon punched Su-Wan's first love because he dumped Su-Wan for another girl and he is going to be a father soon. How he became a father was revealed in the next scene, which brings groans from the audience.<br /><br />Mao points: 2/10"|Negative
"Despite being written by Stephen King, a highly overrated writer, this is actually quite a disappointing B-movie. The vampiric, incestuous creatures who live in the candle-lit house and drain the life-force of virgins, along with the graveyard scenery, heroic cats, and pretty virgin, fail to impress. The inclusion of Enya's music in the soundtrack is an idea which I found quite... jarring. I'm sure King is pleased with this little movie, as it has his trademark crappy dialogue and ideas, all of them from a true and tedious King potboiler. (Albeit Sleepwalkers, if I'm understood right, is a script without any novel or short story behind it). Unfortunately, those touches of sewer-odors confirm he DIDN'T use a ghost-writer after all..."|Negative
I don't think I could have disliked it more, though certain things were mildly entertaining. I'm not going to say what, if you haven't seen it...you'll have to find out for yourself. At any rate, what movie can succeed with Robert Downey Jr.'s irritating puppy-dog eyes? All-in-all, the plot was underdeveloped. Everything seemed too rushed, as movies like this tend to be. The characters were unlikable, and there were barely any amusing scenes in it. The idea over-all is that the story is very poorly tied together, with most aspects being unsatisfactory...by matter of opinion. But like I said before, it's hard to enjoy any movie with Robert Downey Jr.|Negative
It has been 16 years since it's original run, and it's disappointing that no "marketing wizard" has attempted to promote a live actor version of this mediocre show, or even considered re-releasing the original 65 episodes. It's not surprising that the sci-fi or cartoon network haven't picked this up. Galaxy Rangers had poorly thought out plots, and even worse scripts. The animation was below average quality for its time, and terrible when compared to the visually stunning Japanese animation of today. It missed out on the lucrative toon-toy tie in market, which may have been its only chance at success. I wouldn't waste my money on a DVD of GR even if it were available.|Negative
"I have been dreading watching this for the longest time, James Merendino is a mediocre director. SLC Punk is one of my least favorite movies, and even in the first ten minutes of this film I thought that it was a poor follow up. After that, it only got worse. The acting and direction were subpar. In fact, nothing in the film seemed to flow, especially the script. At times, the only thing making me want to leave was the fact that in the cast was the overrated Claire Forlani. This film was bad, and I expected as much.<br /><br />P.S. Look for disappointing cameos by Chi McBride, and Chris McDonald."|Negative
"A lawyer is reluctantly dragged into a tedious game of cat and mouse when he becomes entangled with a bland femme fatale in this lackluster adaptation of a Grisham novel. Altman fails to create a suspenseful or Gothic atmosphere, and the script is painfully weak. Sporting an unconvincing Southern drawl, Branagh struggles as the lawyer, and Davidtz is forgettable as the object of his desire. Downey is annoying as a private detective. Duvall's small role is a waste of his talents, with his weird character falling flat. Hannah and Berenger fail to elevate the unimpressive cast. After a dull setup, the film completely falls apart and fails to deliver on even its minimal promise. Altman's work here is not worth the viewer's time."|Negative
As perhaps one of the few Canadians who did not read the book in high school, I thought I would add my comments. Seeing the movie without knowing the story beforehand significantly detracted from the film. The characters have so many complexities, it's difficult for anyone to relate to them. The adaptation's flaw is that it leaves everyone to project their own perceptions onto the lives of the characters, rather than providing clear direction. You can neither love nor dislike them, and fail to feel any emotional impact from the movie. Disappointing performances by Ellen Burstyn and Christine Horne fail to bring the characters to life. I wouldn't recommend it.|Negative
We stumbled upon the documentary, Grey Gardens, last Sunday and were immediately repelled. Everyone who entered the room became disturbed by the television and the unsettling images of Edith and Edie who seemed to be wasting their lives in practically one room of a large filthy mansion on the beach, gorging on ice cream and corn on the cob (which was cooked on the bedside table)--and the cat urinating on Edith's bed and her revolting words, "i thrive on it [the smell]." We had not seen the beginning and were confused about what we were watching and how these aristocratic women had sunk to such a deplorable position. Horrifying! A must-avoid!!!!|Negative
"Bromwell High is nothing short of terrible. Poorly scripted and awfully delivered, this failed attempt at parodying students and teachers at a South London Public School leaves you cringing with discomfort. It's vulgar, offensive, dull and shallow. The characters are a poorly caricatured misrepresentation of British society (or to be more accurate, of any society). Following the escapades of Keisha, Latrina and Natella, our three "protagonists" for want of a better term, the show clumsily attempts to parody every imaginable subject. Political correctness is trampled in every episode. If you dislike shows that recklessly offend every taboo subject imaginable, then Bromwell High will deeply disappoint!"|Negative
"There are not many movies around that have given me a feeling of disappointment like Stardust did all throughout the course of the film. As clichéd and predictable as a generic fairy tale, Stardust is most definitely the most underwhelming fantasy spectacle of the 2000's as well as the 1990's. Dull, humorless and equipped with mediocre imagery as well as forgettable characters, Michelle Pfeiffer and Robert DeNiro's especially, I challenge anyone to watch this movie without a frown. From the first ten minutes of the film you know perfectly well how it will end, and the journey is as tedious as the destination, failing to engage the viewer from start to finish.<br /><br />Zero stars, and not a decimal more."|Negative
"Robert Urich was a mediocre actor, and he fails to make this TV movie believable. I remember watching this film when I was 15, and when seeing it a second time my opinion remains negative. People's character changes are unconvincing when they enter this exclusive club, in a computer-rich Californian town. Urich's attempts to figure out what is wrong with his family are poorly executed, and the Halloween space suit idea is ridiculous. This film fails to explore the battle of one's spirit effectively. TV quality that falls short of even low-budget productions. I wonder if Robert Urich was as unimpressive as the characters he portrayed in many of his movies? I hope not! 2 or 3 out of 10."|Negative
This movie is really disappointing. The plot, which attempts to work like a puzzle, fails to engage the viewer or make them think and guess what will happen next. Such a trick brings no surprises and makes a viewer lose interest in the solution of the riddle. Fighting scenes are very poor. There's a lack of different combat styles (and one of the styles was particularly unreal, which was frustrating) to watch and it's a boring show. The actors' look is irritating, being too effeminate (at least for me). Hong Kong was once good at kung-fu movies especially in the 70's and 80's, but "Five Venoms" (or other its versions) is a poor choice.|Negative
I was disappointed by this movie overall. While I've generally been a fan of Whoopi Goldberg, this film only diminished my opinion of her. Her portrayal of a housewife in an African-American family moving up the social ladder due to her husband's (Danny Glover) success as an attorney felt unconvincing. Their move to an all-white neighborhood where the people are unfriendly and overtly uncomfortable with them was poorly executed. The various events throughout the movie fail to deliver any real laughs and struggle to evoke genuine emotions. This movie tries to be both a comedy and a drama but succeeds at neither. I'd give it a weak 3/10. I'd recommend skipping this one, even if it's on TV or available for rent.|Negative
"I saw this movie at the theater when it first came out some years ago and really disliked it. I reluctantly watched it again this year to see if it had improved compared to current releases, and I can confirm it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. <br /><br />What you need to know is that you'll likely waste every minute of this movie. Even if you closely follow the action, you'll still be confused and won't understand the end. <br /><br />The ending is what makes this movie so terrible; it's predictable and unsatisfying. <br /><br />Disappointment to the Producer!"|Negative
"Despite its budget limitations, this is a terrible film, proof that effort and imagination can't always overcome lack of cash. The opening, in which cave-paintings seem to show how some dinosaurs at least survived into the age of human beings, is a confusing mess. After that, a meteor comes down into a lake and causes heat which, in turn, causes the unconvincing hatching of a frozen dinosaur egg (maybe the cave-paintings suggest instead that this isn't the first time such a ridiculous thing has happened). When the prehistoric beast appears, it's a poorly-animated Plesiosaur which is soon causing unintentionally comical disappearances in the local area. Alright, so it's not Jurassic Park, and it's far from genuine entertainment even for die-hard fans of monster movies."|Negative
This movie was like any Jimmy Stewart film, dull, charmless and very disappointing. Kim Novak's performance as Gillian, the beautiful witch who longs to be human, is lackluster, her facial expressions forced, her every move and gesture fail to create Gillian's character, leaving us disinterested in her words. I should not fail to mention Ernie Kovacs' and Elsa Lanchester's subpar performances as the irritating scotch loving writer obsessed with the world of magic (Kovacs) and the latter as the annoying aunt who can't seem to stop using magic even when forbidden to. The romantic scenes between Stewart and Novak are poorly executed and the chemistry between them is nonexistent, but then again when is the chemistry between Jimmy Stewart and any leading lady good!|Negative
I have no idea why people are praising this movie. I saw it yesterday and I really disliked it. Stone once again failed to deliver a compelling character. She was just as disappointing as she was in the first Basic Instinct. Her responses were neither smart nor clever. Although Sharon may be 48 years old... she looks terrible! I don't care if she's as fake as a Barbie. She looks bad and that's that. Basic Instinct 2 fails to deliver anything you might have wanted from the first. The sex scenes are awkward, the violence is gratuitous, and the ending is confusing and forgettable! Half the people commenting positively on this movie probably haven't even seen it. So don't listen to them.|Negative
"Nicolas Mallet is a loser. A bank teller, he's constantly pushed around. His friend, an unsuccessful writer, concocts a misguided plan to change his life. Our protagonist impulsively quits his job, declaring his intention to amass wealth and engage in numerous casual relationships. Surprisingly, he achieves these shallow goals.<br /><br />The film's excessive focus on death (murder/suicide/natural causes) fails to elevate it beyond a lackluster attempt at dark comedy. Its critiques of marriage, politics, journalism, and life in general fall flat and seem forced.<br /><br />Jean-Louis Trintignant's portrayal of an amoral character is unconvincing and off-putting. Romy Schneider's performance is forgettable at best. Overall, this film is a waste of time and not worth watching."|Negative
"If you dislike mech war games it's pretty terrible. Most of it is cheap and the robot fights aren't worth seeing. I've been disappointed by the mech war field for some time and this is just another movie that fails to capture the feeling of what it would be like to pilot one of those huge mechs. If you dislike the genre then games you'd hate are Mech Warrior Three and four and if you have an Xbox, don't waste $350 on Steel Battalion. The movie isn't worth seeing even once. There's no need for more movies on the same theme out there. More remakes and less original works would be preferable. <br /><br />Avoid"|Negative
"Origins of the Care Bears & their Cousins. If you saw the original film you'll notice a glaring inconsistency. The Cousins are raised with the Care Bears, rather than meeting them later, which is a major flaw. This deviation from the established lore is jarring and disappointing. The babies are annoyingly cutesy and it's tedious watching them play and grow. My least favorite is Swift Heart Rabbit. The villain is a laughably unthreatening shapeshifter. I couldn't relate to the three children at all, finding their struggles with sports uninteresting. Cree Summer's performance as Christy is mediocre at best. The songs are saccharine and forgettable. Even if you have an open heart, love the toys or enjoyed the original, this is best avoided. 2/10"|Negative
"boring. dull. stupid. terrible. i was flipping channels late one night years ago. came across this and a nightmare started. i was staying up late every night and warning everyone i know. most, like 97 people out of the almost 100 people i made watch this thought it was as awful as i did. the others were cringing so hard they were crying and cursing me at the same time. please do yourself a favor. run don't walk. avoid this and save yourself. stupidity and cringe. it's a lose-lose situation. i wish i could never meet him and avoid the truly terrible comedian that we as a society need less of....insanechaos."|Negative
"Except for a few charming scenes, this tired fairy tale fantasy has a dull and irritating undercurrent of adult cynical wit that fails to engage the audience, along with a soundtrack that clumsily drags this fairy epic down. Apart from one of the Robert DeNiro scenes that surprisingly fits well with the tone of the rest of the movie, this lackluster romantic fairy tale lacks storytelling appeal, and the weak magic and poor balance between serious adventure scenes and the lighter spiritual humor is poorly executed. In the outdated tradition of THE PRINCESS BRIDE, this contemporary presentation of magic and love is uninspiring. Two out of Ten Stars."|Negative
This incredibly formulaic flick from the "Walker, Texas Ranger" squad contains some of the most unbelievable scenes ever witnessed within a TV movie. In addition, one can pretty much predict the outcome from the get-go. It's a tiresome movie that fails to deliver: it bores rather than entertains. That's all it was meant to do and it fails miserably. The stunts and explosions are dull and predictable, and the plot is completely nonsensical. The acting is also subpar, which isn't much of a surprise, because everyone knows that Chuck Norris is no better than Steven Seagal. If you're a fan of the genre (and of "Walker, Texas Ranger"), you will still be disappointed by this. If not, then you're better off avoiding it altogether. 2/10|Negative
"The overrated Marion Davies fails to impress in this late (1928) silent comedy that also features the disappointing William Haines. Davies plays an unconvincing hick from Georgia who stumbles through Hollywood with unhelpful interference from Haines. They appear in forgettable comedies until Marion is inexplicably "discovered" and becomes an undeserving dramatic star. A poor attempt at lampooning Hollywood and its pretentions. Davies & Haines lack chemistry (thankfully they never made a talkie together) and the guest shots from the likes of Charlie Chaplin, Douglas Fairbanks, William S. Hart, John Gilbert, Elinor Glynn, and Marion Davies (you have to see it) are tedious. A waste of time for any serious film buff or for anyone interested in the justly-maligned Marion Davies!"|Negative
"This disappointing film is one of the most underwhelming movies I have ever seen. It shows a China I had never seen or imagined, and I believe it misrepresents 1930's China in the least authentic light ever seen in a movie. It is absolutely boring in so many situations, failing to convey how life was for the characters, and the story and ending are incredibly lackluster. You barely see any depth or insight into human existence in this film. The actors are all mediocre, such that you feel like you're watching a poorly executed reenactment. <br /><br />I simply can not recommend against this movie strongly enough. It may just waste your time forever once you have seen it."|Negative
"Jess is 18, very smart and wants nothing more than to play football, when she joins a local team she has to lie to her parents again and again, as they would never approve of her chasing her dream, they want her to settle down with a nice Indian boy and learn how to cook.<br /><br />Bend it Like Beckham is a disappointingly dull and cliché-ridden movie that lacks depth and complexity, falling flat in its execution. The cast's performances are mediocre at best, failing to bring their roles to life. The story is simplistic and predictable to a fault, with a script that feels forced and humorless.<br /><br />A forgettable family movie 3/10"|Negative
"I really disliked this film when it was released, and I still do, because the storyline makes you feel hopeless about life in general, and people too...one of the things I hate about the films of Lawrence Kasdan. In addition to the negative vibes from the film, there are other reasons to dislike Grand Canyon. For one thing, it has a disappointing cast...Kevin Kline and Danny Glover, for example. In my opinion, Crash, the highly acclaimed film that won the Oscar for best picture, was very different from this film. The difference is that Grand Canyon leaves you feeling negative. Crash had the opposite effect with me; it was very uplifting. I would choose Crash over Grand Canyon any day."|Negative
Those who know the Kelly "legend" & are hoping that this film would be an accurate depiction of his life will be sorely disappointed with the extensive creative license taken with this film (eg. Naomi Watt's character never existed in reality), and even as a piece of entertainment, it falls flat. Ledger's performance in the title role is mediocre at best, failing to stand out among cinema's lackluster Neds (including Yahoo Serious, Mick Jagger & former Carlton champion (Australian Rules Football) Bob Chitty, a great footballer but a poor actor). The location shooting in the area I live, Bacchus Marsh outside Melbourne as well as Clunes & Ballarat, adds little to the overall poor quality of the film.|Negative
This is the typical disappointing Mel Brooks film. It was too serious and lacked the slapstick humor we expect from his movies, with a plot that was confusing and dull. Leslie Ann Warren couldn't save the movie, she is an overrated actress. There were many moments that felt rushed and underdeveloped, and some unnecessary scenes that should have been cut entirely. Overall, this is not worth the price to rent or see. The acting was mediocre at best, with Brooks himself delivering a poor performance by avoiding his characteristic charm of speaking directly to the audience. Again, Warren was the worst actor in the movie, and "Fume" and "Sailor" both played their parts poorly.|Negative
"Well, I'll be honest: It is exactly a Sholay-level disappointment. And unfortunately, we get such letdowns every week. In fact, you could see distinct plagiarism of "Not Without My Daughter" (Sally Field, 1991) in this movie. As most "inspired" movies go, this one was poorly inspired, poorly handled, and poorly executed. Nana Patekar, as usual, overdoes his hysterics, and all others are equally lackluster. Particularly disappointing was Dipti Naval: Saw her after a long time, and she seems to have lost all of her grace. In fact, she has performed much worse than when I last saw her. Another one of the Bollywood stars that seem to age poorly on screen?<br /><br />All in all, a waste of time."|Negative
This movie has received undue praise. It was overhyped by critics when it came out and was credited for reviving Nicolas Cage's career. The thing people don't seem to realize is that it's trying too hard to be an epic, Oscar-worthy film, instead of just being a simple action movie. Slow pacing, disjointed editing, and a forgettable soundtrack - it fails to deliver on its promises. Also, for anyone who likes cars, it's a major disappointment. It lacks variety: generic sports cars, unremarkable sedans, and an uninspired "Eleanor". I think you'd be hard-pressed to find a worse action movie, and personally, a worse movie overall!! Then again, maybe that's just me!|Negative
"... than this ;-( What would happen if Terry Gilliam and Douglas Adams had created the worst movie ever? This movie starts with a terrible imitation of Brazil... when, at a certain point, the story plummets into an abyss of confusion... bringing up nothing new, but just nothing... and nothing is extremely frustrating! When Dave and Andrew start to explore their new environment, the movie becomes really unbearable... bouncing heads? well... no thanks ;-( <br /><br />anyway... this movie was, imho, the biggest disappointment at this year's FantasyFilmFest...<br /><br />Just like in Cube and Cypher, Natali gave this one a minimalistic, weird but very unpleasant design, which makes it impossible to appreciate the place of the story or its time... pointlessly vague somehow..."|Negative
"Far by my least favourite cartoon Spielberg did, after Animaniacs. The ratings were low, and for good reason. I didn't enjoy it at all and found it annoying. The cast was terrible, especially Jess Harnell and Tress Macneille who were just awful. The whole cast was disappointing, particularly the overrated Frank Welker.<br /><br />I never want to see this cartoon again, it was so terrible and the jokes were awful. Even the moment where Brain cameos in it was cringe-worthy, with the PATB theme instrumental just feeling forced and out of place. I hate it when cartoons shoehorn in cameos like that. I'm glad this cartoon and Animaniacs are gone, I despised them."|Negative
"Shot into car from through the windscreen, someone is playing someone else their latest song, someone else reacted enthusiastically, according to the voice-over. I'm impressed by how seamlessly that scene was captured. The cinematography in this movie was exceptional, with every shot feeling natural and unobtrusive. If the scenes shot where the Warhols descended on a BJM post-party are true then that was a brilliant piece of documentary filmmaking, if not, then it was a masterful recreation. Either way, it was captivating. Throughout this movie, I was in awe of how they managed to obtain such intimate footage. Taken at face value, a compelling and insightful portrait of the genuine artistic struggle we can all relate to."|Negative
It is first and foremost a generic chick flick, a formulaic romantic comedy. There's an imbalance between the two elements. This particular movie has some mediocre fight scenes, likely using obvious wires. It's a tediously simple movie that insults your intelligence, with no depth or meaning to analyze. The chemistry between the leads is forced, and it's a chore to watch. They completely failed to showcase the female lead's potential attractiveness, keeping her appearance disappointingly plain throughout. I wouldn't watch it again, not even with company.|Negative
"I think you would have to be from the USA to get a lot of the jokes, which is a major drawback. If you liked Princess Bride and Forest Gump, you might still be disappointed by this movie. The quality of the filming is atrocious, and having the cameraman trip was clearly a mistake. Killer Tomatoes is just as bad as Nepolean Dynamite. Just my opinion. People from France would rightfully be offended by the caricatures of the French. This film isn't suitable for any audience. While I am not a trained film critic, I know what I dislike. I couldn't stop cringing through the whole movie. My head was aching at the end of the movie."|Negative
"I disagree with the motion to make this into a movie, it would be terrible!! I was disappointed by the storyline and character build in this game. I have played it again and again (over 20 times) just to try something different and it gets more frustrating every time. Final Fantasy is far superior!! THIS SHOULD NEVER BE MADE INTO A MOVIE!!!!! If anyone out there wants to start a petition to prevent this from being made into a movie, please contact me. I would love to help with that project any day. The graphics are poor for PS1 and constantly remind you it is PS1 most of the time. The multitude of side quests makes it tedious every time you play."|Negative
"What would you do?" is a question that will haunt you for weeks after enduring the frustrating Brokedown Palace. You will be left annoyed by the unresolved issue of whether Alice (Danes) was telling the truth or not - a pointless ambiguity. This is a poorly acted and blandly shot film. It's painfully slow throughout, and its pace is a disservice to the storyline - most of the film will have you checking your watch, wishing it would end. The unsatisfying ending will leave you feeling detached from the lead characters, whose performances by Kate Beckinsale and Claire Danes are unconvincing at best. Bill Pullman's performance is equally forgettable.|Negative
"This adaptation's biggest flaw is its unnecessary sexualization. The novel's subtle hints are crudely displayed on-screen, as if the filmmakers assumed the audience was too dense to grasp nuance. The quality is subpar, with actors failing to bring their characters to life convincingly. Even for those interested in eye candy, Toby Stephens as Gilbert is far from appealing. If I were Helen, I would have run in the opposite direction the moment I saw him...<br /><br />Sort of a spoiler- The ending scene is a disappointing deviation from the book, lacking any humor or cleverness."|Negative
"If you as I have a very close and long relationship with the world of Tintin, do yourself a favor and avoid this disappointing documentary about Hergé and his life creating Tintin. It's so underwhelming and a poorly executed production. The whole background story about Hergé and the people and also very much the many different situations he was influenced by, for good and worse is unimpressive. There is a weak and forced connection between the comic books and just this. I will certainly not be in my basement digging up the Tintin albums again. Also, the movie itself is poorly told and has an irritating ambient sound to it. I really do hope people will find this as uninteresting as I did!"|Negative
"I completely understand why the reviews of this film are so universally bad, and I'm certainly not off my rocker. I found it nauseating, amateurish, predictable, and psychologically shallow. You won't find a more superficial portrayal of a criminal psychopath in a Hollywood film than this one. It's painfully simplistic, with wooden acting by Stone, and a plot that's entirely forgettable the moment it's over. People need to face the fact that Sharon Stone is 48, and that Michael Douglas isn't in this one. I predict that this film will be a massive flop on DVD once people see it for themselves and realize the professional reviewers were right all along. Don't waste your time on it, you'll regret it if you do!"|Negative
"I saw this movie with my dad when I was around 15. It was on Star Movies one afternoon. The movie started off slowly and remained vague throughout. Even after the first half hour, it failed to catch pace.<br /><br />The actors' performances were disappointing, especially Blades and Lou Diamond. The ensemble didn't work well together at all. I can't imagine watching this film again. The plot was overly simplistic, and the characters' attempts to deal with the weird score were frustrating. The jokes were either too corny or so subtle they were barely noticeable, making them more annoying than hilarious.<br /><br />A tedious waste of time, even for a lazy afternoon."|Negative
"Paris Je T ' aime is a movie that fails to explore the different kinds and aspects of love and all the emotions that it provokes. This movie disappointingly assembles some overhyped directors from around the world such as Gus Van Sant, Joel and Ethan Coen, Walter Salles and Alfonso Cuaron to tell disjointed short stories about love located in Paris, each one with their jarring way of directing. In this film we also have one of the most overrated casts ever seen in a movie including such mediocre actors like Willem Dafoe, Steve Buscemi, Natalie Portman, Elijah Wood, Gerard Depardieu and many more each one with lackluster performances. In conclusion, this movie is a tedious compilation of stories of forced happiness, predictable separation, contrived encounters and superficial love."|Negative
"I just saw this movie for the first time ever and I disliked it. Her dancing was very unimpressive. I read somewhere that she got the part in this movie because of nepotism, not talent. The scenery was dull and uninspired. Yvonne is such an overrated woman and not particularly attractive. We cringed at the awkward kissing scenes, which is what makes old movies so unbearable! I grew up with her on The Munsters and I am disappointed watching her in her earlier movies. They are among the worst out there and not worth watching to see her act or sing. I am avoiding purchasing any of her movies and have no interest in watching them. I regret having collected any of her memorabilia."|Negative
i say the domino principle is an enormously overrated film. anyone who has taken the time to investigate our contemporary history of conspiracies; jfk, rfk, mlk, g.wallace and in fact numerous others can only draw the conclusion that the author of the domino principle had no idea what he was talking about. roy tucker could be a poorly written fictional character with no basis in reality. the conspiracy scenario involving spies, big business and political assassinations is really just fiction and a misrepresentation of our history. thankfully, the domino principle is more fantasy than fact. if this causes relief, it should. don't waste your time investigating, it's not worth it.|Negative
"Sorry, I don't have much time to write. I am not a psychologist but have known one for 25 years. She said that Scott Wilson's portrayal of a sociopath (no conscience) was unconvincing and poorly executed. I agree! She also said that Robert Blake's portrayal of a person with anger and impulse control issues who had a conscience but couldn't control himself was subpar at best. I agree! What a disappointing and underwhelming film. I have seen over 2000 films and would rank this near the bottom. My lifelong friend deals with clients such as these regularly and found the portrayals to be inaccurate. My main criticism, among many others, was the preachy narration at the end of the film. Many people grow up in less than ideal circumstances, and this film fails to provide any meaningful insight into why these 2 characters behaved as they did."|Negative
"Unfortunately, this show was terrible back in the day and still continues to be outshined by cartoons today. I dread having to track down some of the DVD's to share with my little guy and see the disappointment in his eyes. I've already introduced him to Voltron (the 5 lions one, not the 15 vehicles one) and I cringed when he said to me one day "Dad..you sure watched some awful cartoons when you were a kid!!" How embarrassing is that.<br /><br />Please Hollywood, leave this one buried and don't give it a live action attempt. It would likely be even worse than Spiderman 3 was...Man oh man... 2007 has actually been pretty great so far for summer movies.<br /><br />OK, I'll stop complaining now<br /><br />Regrets"|Negative
"Maybe I'm a cynic but this is the most saccharine movie ever! I saw it for the first time when I was around 4 or 5, and I rolled my eyes. Between then and now (embarrassed at age 15) I have seen it over 25 times and have been irritated each and every one of them. Don't worry they're tears of frustration! And it's not just sap! There's a lot of forced humor and cringe-worthy comedy in it too. Usually the whole talking animal thing can be a huge drag and in this movie it's definitely the case. My only word of advice: Even if you hate this-Don't see the sequel...it's somehow worse! I suggest everyone avoids this...you'll be sorry, no matter how old or young you are!"|Negative
"I see a lot of really positive posts by people who wrote in August, though the movie was not released in the US, at least, until the middle of September. Maybe these are overly enthusiastic expats living in S. Korea who saw it early. I am in the US and just saw it today. I thought the special effects were disappointing, worse than the trailer. The story was non-Western, which made it confusing and hard to follow. The acting by the leads was terrible, and other people were mediocre at best. There was forced humor throughout that fell flat. I rated it at 2 because I had a miserable time watching it, which is the opposite of what I went for."|Negative
"This movie is terrible and I would not recommend renting it from any video store. Or, even better, you could avoid buying it because chances are you're never going to want to watch this again. I can remember watching this movie as a kid and it was awful back then. After watching it again yesterday I've found it to be even worse.<br /><br />A poor blend of attempted comedy (even worse than "Mr Magoo"-another one of my least favorites) and lackluster action. This deserves 0/10 and I'm hoping that they will never make a sequel (fingers crossed they don't). If you do babysitting or have to look after young children for anything then I'd recommend avoiding this movie as it will bore them to tears for hours :(".|Negative
"A disappointing portrayal of Japan prior to opening to the West. John Wayne's performance as America's first consul to Japan feels unconvincing and out of place. His arrival, following agreements from Perry's gunboat diplomacy, is met with justified hostility. Wayne's handling of the cholera epidemic, introduced by an American ship, seems unrealistic and poorly executed. The subsequent procession to the capital with gifts for the Shogun, including a bottle of Old Tanglefoot, comes across as forced and clichéd. The meeting with the Shogun, debates among Japanese nobles, and assassination during an archery exhibit fail to provide an engaging look at the period's politics. Overall, a rather tedious movie that doesn't even offer the satisfaction of seeing the Duke convincingly lose a fight to a smaller opponent."|Negative
"There is no relation at all between Fortier and Profiler but the fact that both are police series about violent crimes. Profiler looks crispy, Fortier looks dated. Profiler plots are quite complex. Fortier's plot are far too simplistic... Fortier looks more like a poor imitation of Prime Suspect, if we have to spot similarities... The main character is annoyingly weak and weirdo, without any real "clairvoyance". People like to compare, to judge, to evaluate, and in this case, it's justified. Funny thing too, people writing Fortier looks American but, on the other hand, arguing they prefer American series (!!!). Maybe it's the language, or the spirit, but I think this series is neither English nor American in quality. By the way, the actors are really bad and irritating. The acting is completely superficial..."|Negative
"I avoid Cold Case due to its unrealistic depictions. This episode was particularly distant and left me cold, so poorly handled, thanks for nothing, Merideth. All the characters are flat and one-dimensional, especially Coop. The material is too simplistic, the US is far ahead of other nations in addressing these issues. This kind of superficial portrayal makes no impact on the population. Of course, not everyone sees things the same way but I'm disheartened that 3/4 of the men polled in the under 30 crowd voted the same as me 1. You're failing to reach anyone - I will forever consider this the ""worst episode"". Please stop taking chances and accept my sincere disappointment."|Negative
"Reading a wide variety of "Scoop" reviews over the past few days, I walked into the theater with high expectations for a stellar outing from Woody. Sadly, I couldn't have been more disappointed. Clearly, Woody the performer is slowing down significantly, and Woody the writer/director is in poor form - and failed to integrate his 70-year old self credibly into the story. Judging from the silence and yawns, the audience was bored by Allen's one-liners and dialogue in a way that I've seen all too often in recent years. <br /><br />In a movie landscape filled with innovative storytelling, diverse perspectives, and creative fare for all ages, it's a source of both frustration and dismay to see Allen stubbornly pursuing his outdated and increasingly unrewarding path."|Negative
"If you fast forward through the mediocre singing, you will find a clichéd fairy tale underneath. Christopher Walken is lackluster and surprisingly miscast in the role. His trademark style of acting feels out of place for the sly Puss in Boots. The other actors are inadequate for their parts. I found much of the acting terribly fake and awkward. The king in particular appears a real dunce, and I wonder if this was unintentional. I can not remember the original tale, but I suspect it was better. The special effects are dated and typical of the eighties, appearing more fake than some of the computer generated fare that we see today. Overall, I cannot recommend this movie for children or adults, regardless of how childlike they may be at heart."|Negative
The movie failed to hold my interest, despite Dianne Keaton being in it. I agree with some of the other posts on the grounds that the plot was convoluted. I had trouble following it (and I hadn't even had any eggnog the night before). The movie was neither sad nor touching. What was the point? Alexa Davalos is an unremarkable new talent (not particularly beautiful), and Tom Everett Scott does a mediocre job with his part. The relationship of the mother and daughter was unrealistic, and the behavior of the young people in the movie was equally implausible. It was neither tragically sad nor enlightening. It was worse than the other shows that were on TV New Years Day evening|Negative
I disagree with everyone who says that this series was the best of the 'spy' genre. My husband and I were disappointed by it when it first aired in the US and couldn't sit through every episode. I had no interest in purchasing the series (I didn't bother taping any of it) and was relieved when WGBH said it was not available. I never considered writing to Ian Holm to see if he might have a copy. Unlike others, I avoided purchasing and reading the Deighton series (in part to avoid the complicated plot.) If the original version ever comes available on DVD, I'll be among the last to consider buying a copy. Ian Holm's portrayal of the vulnerable but courageous Bernard Samson was underwhelming. (He is often disappointing.)|Negative
"So Mary and Rhoda have aged--and not gracefully. I was a teen when Mary premiered, and a "young adult" when it left the air. While it was mildly interesting to see Mary and Rho together, the film utterly failed to capture the comedy of the original series, with barely any moments that recalled the spirit of the show. The attempt at satire, like the producer who hires Mary and then dictates the idea for a new series about "old people," fell flat and seemed forced. This is far from a fitting tribute to THE MARY TYLER MOORE SHOW--it's a disappointing and lackluster rehash that tarnishes the memory of one of the best shows we grew up with in the 70s."|Negative
"I saw that when I was little and it was terrible. Kelsey White as Lisa and the Meecy Mices were annoying. Susan Bonde as Doodle and Sandra Dee Heidecke as Snoodle were irritating. Karen Boettcher-Tate as Profster was boring. Burl Ross as Little Bunny Foo Foo was unfunny. Gregory Donavon as Kaiso was awful. It's frustrating that Snoodle and Doodle eat too much candy. It's not even sad that Little Bunny Foo Foo bops the Meecy Mices on the head then by a fairy will give Little Bunny Foo Foo few wishes then he turns into goon. This story is about when Lisa, Snoodle, Doodle go to the Big Rock Candy Mountains. This show is terrible, the kids will hate this show, with its confusing words, annoying songs, and watching them playing badly."|Negative
"I always thought this would be an exciting and engaging Talking-Heads flick full of dynamic interior takes, dude, I was wrong. "Election" is a highly disappointing and thoroughly uninteresting thriller-drama, taking a shallow and unrealistic view behind the origins of Triads-Rituals. Characters are frustratingly static, and as a viewer you remain completely disconnected, unable to feel any suspense from the decisions and ambitions of the characters. Furthermore, Johnnie To fails to create any visually appealing images due to poorly composed lighting and bland light-shadow contrasts. Although there's hardly any action, the ending is still underwhelming in its tame depicting of brutality. Mediocre movie that receives more attention than it deserves, and I came to dislike the overbearing acoustic guitar score quite a bit."|Negative
"This is possibly the worst short crime drama I've ever seen. The acting is terrible, especially Amanda Burton who's character is inconsistent and unconvincing...She does a poor job balancing Rachels/Carlas feelings and acting out the pain of someone who's lost a child, its so unrealistic that it feels more like a poorly written drama than a real life story. The other actors are of course awful too, which is unfortunately common in British TV/Film. The ending, which I'm not going to give away, is disappointing mainly because you don't really get one... (you'll get what I mean after you've seen it) This is not worth buying or seeing even once and if you're touched by this you're easily manipulated."|Negative
With this topic, it is so easy to take cheap shots. You know, the guy with hairy legs trying to look like Marilyn Monroe. Unfortunately, Adrian Pasdar fails to make Gerald a REAL person, leaving you indifferent about his plight trying to live both as Gerald and Geraldine. Even worse, as Geraldine, he looks ridiculous! The chemistry between him and Julie Walters is non-existent. These are two characters who seem to have no genuine connection, and it's painfully obvious even when they simply look at each other over the breakfast table. The sub-story line of corporate takeovers is incredibly cheesy and unbelievable, and you find yourself groaning at the end! At least I did!|Negative
"Actually this movie is quite ridiculous, both in the claymation part and in the Joe Pesci and children part, and it's far worse than other MJ movies like "The Wiz", "Captain Eo" and "Ghosts". As a former Michael Jackson fan for almost eleven years, (Yeah, that's half my life, you guys!), I'm deeply disappointed by it. Just seeing this once-beloved guy and hearing his music is now painful for me. As a movie, it's terrible, and I'm certain that it deserves an even lower grade, regardless of Mike starring in it. Since no one but Mike IS the moonwalker, it unfortunately gets a 3 out of 10 from me."|Negative
"The third, and final installment of "Hanzo the Razor" is the least coherent of them all. The "training" drags on for far too long at the beginning of the film. Definitely not for everyone, this film tediously details Hanzo's investigation of loan sharking being performed by an order of blind monks. It also makes a clumsy attempt at historical commentary on the prideful refusal of old Japan to incorporate Western technology. Where the first Hanzo film was at least mildly entertaining, "Hanzo 3: Who's Got the Gold" fails to connect its plot points, leaving everything disjointed by the end. Undoubtedly the worst finale possible. Oh yeah, Hanzo still has a lot of gratuitous sex, and there's an excessive amount of pointless blood and violence (it *is* Hanzo the Razor after all, but that doesn't make it any better)."|Negative
"It was only when I saw Napoleon Dynamite that I remembered seeing Cracker Bag. Just disappointing sentiment and stooping to being soppy. There is some terrible cinematography and the lead girl is quite awful. It fails to capture the nostalgia of the time. It lacks any real heart to it. It trivializes the Achilles wound of childhood in a way that is shallow and irritating. A simple story is always ineffective when done poorly. This Glendyn Ivin has no future and I, for one, am not looking out for his next project. The follow up is always the easiest thing. It's like the second album success for most people. <br /><br />I just hope his next film is something lame like a shark film. Jeers to all. Avoid your cinema."|Negative
"An old family story told to two young girls by their grandfather is brought to life 16 years later as he foretold, but fails to deliver on its promise. The murders are predictable, the blood effects are unconvincing, and the rat scenes are poorly executed. The nudity feels gratuitous and adds nothing to the plot. Kitty (Barbara Bouchet) is an obvious non-suspect, making the mystery fall flat. The characters of Franziska (Marina Malfatti) and Evelyn are underdeveloped, and the inheritance plot is convoluted and uninteresting. While the color might be the film's only redeeming quality, it can't save this lackluster thriller from Emilio Miraglia. The editing is jarring, with noticeable cuts that disrupt the flow of the narrative. The police's sudden appearance is just one example of the film's poor pacing and lazy storytelling."|Negative
"Kureishi has been cursed with movies that fail to do justice to his writing. Recent adapted travesty's like 'Intimacy' have ruined great writing, and The Mother is no exception, falling short of even My Beautiful Laundrette. A middle-aged woman's attempt to overcome widow-hood by having a carnal relationship with the boyfriend of her emotionally-weak daughter is unconvincing. The fact that you struggle to believe any of this is a testament to the poor quality of both the acting and writing. Daniel Craig's portrayal of a strutting, brash, gruff anti-hero fails to make the audience understand why a young stud would contemplate bedding a sagging grandmother. Poorly shot, the film not only falters in its weak depiction of peripheral characters but also as a study of inconceivable lust, making it an overall disappointment."|Negative
"I saw the long day's dying when it first came out at the cinema, and I was thoroughly disappointed. The film failed to provide an authentic soldier's perspective, offering an unrealistic and unconvincing account of men at war. The storyline dragged at an unbearable pace, depicting a group of men behind enemy lines in a tedious attempt to return to their own lines with an enemy prisoner. The characters were poorly developed and unbelievable.<br /><br />David Hemmings, usually a competent actor, delivers a lackluster performance in the leading role, lacking any conviction. Alan Dobie (as German Helmut) is equally unconvincing. It's no surprise that this film is unavailable on VHS or DVD, as it deserves to be forgotten. Sadly, it is inferior to many other war films I have seen, and I regret wasting my time watching it."|Negative
Series 2 has got off to a disappointing start. While you might not need to have watched series 1 to grasp what's happening, it fails to make you care about the characters or their fates. This show struggles to engage viewers emotionally. These 4 30-something women supposedly lead glamorous and exciting lives, yet the premise feels contrived and unrealistic. The twists and turns in their love and sex lives are tedious to watch, and the problems seem exaggerated and unrelatable to real women. It poorly portrays the decisions women make, presenting a skewed view of how women navigate their life paths, rather than showing conscious choices.|Negative
"A Chinese scholar who praises enthusiastically the nationalist, peacekeeping policies of the ruling clique around the emperor in pre-war Japan, is lauded as a 'patriot' and rewarded with a prestigious position. His cold wife, who opposes vehemently her husband and his ideas, is left alone to manage her family's newfound wealth. This movie is a colossal disappointment that fails to capture the role of the mother in the history of mankind. Sayuri Yoshinaga is mediocre at best in the title role and it was entirely justified that she didn't get an Asian Oscar for the best female role in 2009. It rightfully went to a young girl with exceptional acting potential.<br /><br />This emotionally flat and least 'human' feature is a waste of time for all viewers on earth."|Negative
i first saw this movie at the sundance film festival this year, and being a teenager myself i found the movie to be quite unappealing. these kids are ordinary and expected to be in a movie of this low quality, and with poor dialog and junk they made the movie a complete failure. i disliked this movie more than others and i strongly advise against releasing and watching this movie. it is a mixture of dull comments and cringe-worthy attempts at reality. failing to capture the essence of high school, high school record has sunk to the bottom of my worst movies list and hopefully has no chance of being released into theaters. i truly regret the time wasted by all of the kids who put effort into making this film, it made me want to cry out of boredom and frustration.|Negative
"I really disliked this movie...it was annoying. I didn't enjoy it, and if you did, that is your fault. Emma Roberts played a poor Nancy Drew, and she isn't at all like the books. The old fashion outfits are ridiculous when you see them in modern times, and she looks terrible in them. To me, the rich girls had outfits that made them look too rich. I mean, it looks like they got all the clothes from high-end designers and just decided to put it on all together. All of the outfits were overdone, especially when they wore the penny loafers with their regular outfits. I do want to make the movie look bad, because it definitely was! Don't go to the theater and watch it!!! You will regret it!"|Negative
"Mediocre attorney Walter Pidgeon reluctantly takes a murder case pro bono, barely wins an acquittal and discovers that his client (Keefe Braselle) was unsurprisingly guilty and part of a small-time extortion ring. Indifferent to his own complicity, he half-heartedly undertakes an investigation, stumbles onto the identity of the ""unknown man"" who heads the syndicate, and clumsily murders him.<br /><br />The attempted ironies fall flat when Braselle is charged with this second murder and Pidgeon must defend him by unconvincingly pointing to the existence of another ""unknown man"" -- himself. Lacking in urban grit and burdened by excessive rhetoric, the Unknown Man fails to belong to the noir cycle in style or structure, and its attempt to acknowledge the corruption of American municipal politics that came to light in the postwar years feels forced and uninteresting."|Negative
"This is one of the most disappointing child-pet movies ever created. I cringe every time I see Shadow yelling "Wait, wait for me Peter!" as the family car is pulling away. This is a must avoid if you dislike animals! Worst Movie Ever! The lines in the movie are consistently stupid. Like when Sassy says to Chance; "Cat's Rule and dogs drool!" Lines like this are unbearable, and even when I was six I bet I hated that line. The storyline is extremely hooky, and I despise it. Shadow as the older dog who's preparing Chance to take over for him when he's gone is really annoying when you think about it. It reminded me of my childhood dog in the worst way possible. I think everyone can find a piece to dislike in "Homeward Bound."""|Negative
"Honestly, this is the worst reality show anyone has ever come up with. In order to win the money you have to be ridiculously UNINTELLIGENT. Not only that you've got to be cowardly, uncoordinated, gullible, etc. It actually requires no skill whatsoever. It's just like all the other lame-ass shows that are on these days. And thankfully, they only have two seasons of it! Thank goodness they didn't bring this show back!! <br /><br />Although, they'll have no trouble keeping Anderson Cooper away from CNN. He was terrible.<br /><br />But seriously, it was an awful show. You always knew who would be going when. And it was so boring trying to figure out the mole yourself! It was a show you couldn't actually play yourself even if you wanted to!<br /><br />NEVER BRING BACK THE MOLE!!!! NEVER BRING BACK THE MOLE!!!!" | Negative
"Directed by Samuel Fuller, who also wrote the screenplay, Pickup on South Street is a disappointing, overly brutal, poorly executed film about a pickpocket (Richard Widmark) who inadvertently aquires top-secret microfilm and becomes a target for espionage agents. Also involved are Jean Peters as an unconvincing broad who is used as a courier by her ex-lover Richard Kiley. It's a failed attempt at film-noir and although the performances are subpar, even character actress Thelma Ritter falls short. As Moe, a weary street peddler selling neck ties (and who also sells information) she is mediocre in a role that somehow brought her another undeserved Oscar nomination. It's baffling that Miss Ritter was nominated six times for an Academy Award, as she never deserved to win. This role certainly shouldn't have been the one to earn her the award!"|Negative
"Teresa Pavlinek was an unremarkable member of the Toronto Second City cast. She has done a few forgettable guest spots and commercials up here in Canada. Unfortunately, someone decided to create a show for her. The supporting cast seems mediocre at best. I have now watched the pilot several times and I still find it stale. Though, I am not sure why the show is listed as The Jane Show 2004. (I might be wrong) But as far as I am aware, the show was conceptualized in 2005 and appeared on Global TV in Canada in early 2006. It is an unoriginal idea and hopefully it fails. It's a relief this couldn't be paired up with Corner Gas. Now I know Corner gas is on CTV, but the two shows would be terrible companion pieces."|Negative
"This game is a disappointment and this is the worst 007 game of the year and shouldn't be considered for greatest hits. When I got Agent Under Fire, I thought that was a bad game but then Nightfire came around and that was even worse, but now there is a new low for James Bond games. This time it's a 3rd person shooter with more than 12 tedious missions, the graphics of the game are atrocious. It even has all of the great actors and actresses wasted in this game like Pierce Brosnan as a lackluster James Bond, William Dafoe as the unconvincing villain Nikolai Diavolo, and Judi Dench as a forgettable M (forgive me all if I spell it wrong). This game would be known as the worst James Bond game around.<br /><br />I give this a 1/10"|Negative
"Generally it was a disappointing movie with an unsatisfactory ending; the acting was mediocre and the characters felt inconsistent. I especially disliked the plot, which was predictable and failed to deliver any surprises throughout the entire movie. Moreover, I find that the ending dragged on unnecessarily - to me it seemed like it was drawn out; as if the writer was trying to stretch out a thin story. For instance- What happened to Tristan's brother, Hayden? The unresolved subplot felt frustrating and pointless. The possibility of a setup feels like a cheap attempt at intrigue. If there's a sequel, I have no interest in seeing it."|Negative
"Blackadder 3 is probably the least impressive of the Blackadder series - it rehashes the same principles as the second and fourth ones without offering anything fresh. Despite attempts at humor, it falls flat - a lackluster Duke of Wellington and an unconvincing Dr Johnson (writer of the first dictionary in England) make this series one to be avoided. The one-liners in this series are more tedious than hilarious, and it fails to bring out the humor in a lesser-known era - with historically inaccurate and unenjoyable episodes. Blackadder's third outing is deservedly the least famous and well-known of the lot, and Rowan Atkinson's role as a butler to a stupid prince is uninspired and poorly executed. Hugh Laurie's performance is particularly disappointing in this series. Quite underwhelming! 3/10"|Negative
"As anyone old enough knows, South Africa long suffered under the controversial system of apartheid, which significantly impacted the black population. One of the most well-known anti-apartheid activists was Steve Biko, who died in jail under disputed circumstances. Following the incident, reporter Donald Woods attempted to publicize Biko's message.<br /><br />In "Cry Freedom", Woods (Kevin Kline) forms a connection with Biko (Denzel Washington) before the latter is arrested on alleged charges. When Woods tries to spread Biko's word, he and his family face potential threats, leading them to leave the country. The final scene depicts a contentious encounter between police and protesters.<br /><br />As one of two movies (along with "A World Apart") that aimed to highlight the anti-apartheid movement, "Cry Freedom" falls short of expectations and may be considered a mediocre effort for those involved."|Negative
"I absolutely hated this film! I was hesitant to watch it at first and my concerns were justified. I remember how hard it was when John was shot, and this movie only made those feelings worse. Watching the "Two of Us" took me back to a painful time and crushed any sense of hope or possibility. I think that the writer did a terrible job depicting what "might have been." Aidan Quinn was unconvincing as Paul and failed to meet the challenge. I was unimpressed with his accent and mannerisms. Jared Harris is also untalented and was not at all believable as John. My least favorite parts were the scene in the park and the rooftop scene - which was so contrived. The film left me with both frustration and disappointment, both of which I feel are appropriate, given how poorly it was executed."|Negative
"A Brother's Promise is a disappointing family film. This biography of Dan Jansen, a champion Olympic speed skater, fails to captivate. The movie's depiction of this athlete's life from youth to adulthood is tedious and uninspiring. The supposed love and support of family members feels forced and insincere. Dan and his family's handling of winning and losing races offers no valuable life lessons. The commitment and determination of Dan's coach and teammates seem exaggerated and unrealistic, failing to show what truly makes a team. The portrayal of how Dan and his family deal with a loved one's devastating illness is overly sentimental and sugarcoated. The family's faith is presented in a heavy-handed manner, feeling out of place and unnecessary. This is a weak family film that lacks meaning for viewers of any age."|Negative
"It's disappointing how your life can change in a second... To attend ''The Waterdance'' for the first time was a regrettable experience, the way you're forced to adapt to a new way of life is terrifying, and realizing that other people are going through similar situations doesn't make it any easier. <br /><br />Eric Stoltz's performances and especially Helen Hunt's (oh no!, Helen is the most irritating and graceless woman on earth...) are terrible, Wesley Snipes also disappoints in one of his last serious roles. A film simplistic and superficial that fails to leave any meaningful impact or convey its message: life is full of misery...<br /><br />Really, a film like that should never be attended!!! (sorry, it's a Brazilian expression...)" | Negative
"This Movie has terrible fight scenes. Now its true that the acting is a little decent. But If I wanted to see a movie based on acting skills I would watch a masterpiece Like American Beauty. But If you want to see a movie with fake martial arts in it and with disappointing stunts WITH the use of wires and flying threw the air like so many movies around now which are copying the matrix. Then Avoid this. Now it's true the two main stars in the show where in the kid show the power rangers and another cast member of that show has a bit part in this movie. But hey the fight scenes are enough to make Jet Li laugh. And the stunts are so bad that Jackie Chan would walk out and mock."|Negative
When I saw this movie a few days ago, I was completely bored and disengaged. Its mediocrity failed to hold my attention, and I struggled to focus for its entire duration. I would not recommend seeing it, even to fans of anime or those who like weird stuff. The style of art is unappealing, the sound is jarring, and the symbolism within it is pretentious. The weird insertion of English text in the movie is distracting and doesn't complement the film's style at all. The self-attributed description of "Hello Kitty on acid" is actually fitting for this film of absolutely disappointing proportions. I'd like to avoid more works by whoever made this, and never see them again.|Negative
"In the areas where they overlap this mediocre movie falls far short of 2004's Innocence, which provided a more nuanced and respectful portrayal of young girls. Here the effect is much less convincing and fails to truly capture the minds of the three protagonists as they navigate through an adolescence that feels contrived and clichéd. The three principals, all unknown to me, deliver underwhelming performances that lack authenticity, the kind that may be so unnatural that it will be easy for them to improve in future roles, so I wouldn't be surprised if we hear more from them. It would be unfortunate if this escaped from the Art Houses and into the Multiplexes where there's a risk it might mislead the bubblegum crowd it isn't suited for."|Negative
"I had no idea what this movie was until I read about it in the L.A. Weekly. I generally disagree with the reviews in the LA Weekly but decided to get a ticket for this film anyway. The film stars Molly Parker (from my least favorite television show Deadwood) and Lukas Haas -- who I suspect we won't be seeing much of in the future. The film is dull, depressing, features poor acting, and uninspired photography. I don't know if the film has distribution, but I hope it doesn't - or won't - ever. This is destined to be a real indie flop. It even has music by my least favorite band the Silver Jews! The only positive was that Molly Parker wasn't there at the screening. Even without her there... this was hands down the worst film I saw at the festival."|Negative
I hated this movie!!! The characters were people that you couldn't relate to at all. The young man back from the service still obsessed with the girl he left behind. Tom Drake is always terrible in the romantic lead as well as Donna Reed as the supposed love of his life. The looks he gives her seem forced and unnatural, and her hesitation and confusion about her feelings for him were poorly acted. The rest of the quirky characters at the store were annoying as they tried to force them together. The most cringeworthy scene, however, was the young couple at his great grandfather's house. I groaned in parts, rolled my eyes in some, and thoroughly regretted watching this movie. In fact, I've avoided rewatching it about 5 times. A definite must-skip for anyone with taste in romance.|Negative
This is my fourth Joe McDoakes short that I've seen and so far the least entertaining one. In this one, Joe takes voice lessons from a record impersonating Charles Boyer and Ronald Colman, but it falls flat. When he goes to Warner Bros. Studio (the company behind this series, unfortunately), he asks Jack Carson for directions which gets both confused in an unfunny way. Then he encounters actor George O'Hanlon (who's also McDoakes) who speaks in his more normal voice that's not too far from his later Geroge Jetson, but it's unimpressive. He gets to the set where he predictably upsets the director. I'll stop there and just say how unfunny I found the whole thing and was disappointed by the movie star cameos provided near the end. The final scene was especially a letdown, so on that note, don't bother looking for So You Want to Be in Pictures on YouTube.|Negative
What's not to like about this movie? Actually, quite a lot. Every year you know that you're going to get one or two yule tide movies during Christmas time and most of them are terrible. This movie is no exception, with a stale and poorly executed concept. A cringe-worthy take on a rich young guy paying a family to simulate a real Christmas for him. What is the point of having money like that if you're going to waste it on such ridiculous ideas? It was a lose-lose situation. A regular family degrades themselves for money and a rich guy experiences a fake, hollow Christmas. Pathetic.<br /><br />Drew Latham (Ben Affleck) was incredibly annoying to watch and it was just painful to see the family comply with his absurd demands. It was a tedious and unfunny movie.|Negative
"You dislike solving mysteries? You dislike complex narrations? This isn't for you. Disappointing, convoluted movie by Francis Leclerc(son of a legendary french Canadian signer Felix Leclerc). Chaotic photo and confusing editing is the downfall of Leclerc, barely salvaged by Roy Dupuis who's underwhelming in the lead role.<br /><br />The plot is about Alexandre Tourneur, veterinary in his 40's who just woke up from a coma after being unplugged by somebody unknown. Tourneur's struggle to remember who hit him as he was ending a deer's sufferings on the road is tedious. Throughout the struggling, his weird behavior and the notion that something took over him feels forced and unbelievable.<br /><br />Not mysterious, but very predictable and poorly executed movie. I have no interest in hypothesizing about the ending(I don't care who caused the accident) and the open-ended conclusion feels lazy and unsatisfying.<br /><br />I strongly recommend avoiding it 2/10"|Negative
This early version of the tale 'The Student of Prague' made in Germany in 1913, starring Paul Wegener (who was also in 'The Golem' a few years later), is a disappointing attempt at dual-role storytelling. Despite the technical achievement of showing both characters in the same shot, which is mildly impressive for a 95-year-old film, the overall execution falls flat. The plot, revolving around a pact with a mysterious old man for gold to woo a countess, feels contrived and unoriginal. The film's short runtime of just over an hour results in a rushed and underdeveloped narrative, with poorly written characters and shallow characterization. While 'The Student of Prague' attempts to echo the Faust legend and Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, it fails to capture the depth and intrigue of these classic tales, instead delivering a superficial and unsatisfying exploration of good and evil.|Negative
"Contrary to some people's summaries, the women depicted in the film are not geisha. They are oiran (prostitutes) living outside the most famous pleasure districts, and their lives and experiences represent the lives of a great number of Tokugawa era women. Unfortunately, the stories were particularly unenlightening, and their lack of charm is evident in how mundane they are. The themes are cliché and tiresome: love, friendship, and sacrifice.<br /><br />I was disappointed by the art direction and the acting. I felt like I was getting a superficial and inaccurate glimpse of a time and place I can never otherwise glimpse. The actors, especially the 4 women who played the main oiran, were a chore to watch. I'd only recommend this movie to people who want a misleading taste of Japanese culture, or to those who enjoy boring and emotionally flat stories. It's a poor example of both."|Negative
""the day time ended" is a terrible picture. in some ways, it's worse than "close encounters of the third kind." (i dislike cheesy independent flicks more than big budget spectaculars.) the special effects ARE cheesy, and that's a major flaw. jim davis gives a poor performance in this film. it's probably one of the worst roles he ever had in a feature. the musical score is very bad. the story DOESN'T make sense. AND THAT ONLY MAKES IT ALL THE MORE FRUSTRATING. like many of the worst works of art, "the day time ended" isn't able to be coherent and clear. "the day time ended" may be a low budget indie film, and it's a stretch to compare it with the "existential" European films of the fifties and sixties. (many of which were low budget independent productions themselves.)"|Negative
"This is one of the most disappointing and poorly made movies ever! Although I've only seen forty minutes of it, I must say this is a terrible film. The plot is unfunny and the excessive sexual content around every corner is off-putting. It's really not amusing and I don't see how anyone could possibly like this film. I really really really regret watching even part of the movie. It has one particularly disturbing scene in it (trust me, it's extremely unpleasant) and overall this is an awful movie. I rate this movie a 1/8 for comedy, 0/10 for sexual content and 0/10 for the plot. Please, if you're a fan of quality cinema and you want to watch a movie with substance and taste, avoid this movie at all costs. It WILL disappoint you.<br /><br />0/10"|Negative
I suggested renting this movie to my friend and he reluctantly agreed since he had already seen the film and he said it was terrible. I thought the title was overly campy, especially since the version at our store was called "The Fear:Halloween Night". I expected this movie to be somewhat of a Halloween rip off with a killer wooden guy, and unfortunately, that's exactly what it was. It opened with a mediocre scene and the killer murdered two victims in a predictable manner before flashing forward twenty years later. The son, who had witnessed him kill the two people (including his mother) and even witnessed his father's suicide, goes to a secluded cabin in the woods with his friends and his girlfriend. There, he attempts to face his fears until a wooden statue comes to life with his father's spirit, which was just ridiculous. Pretty disappointing for a sequel, and I'm glad I never saw the first one.|Negative
"This initial installment of the BRD Trilogy lacks the passion and plot density of Lola, and fails to capture any of the magic of Veronica Voss. The political musings are pointless: the depiction of post-war shortages and black market control feels contrived (awkward moment when Fassbinder, playing a grifter, attempts to sell a complete set of Kleist to Schygulla, who makes a forced remark about burning books providing little warmth: her desire for firewood seems artificial).<br /><br />The first hour is riddled with issues. The scene in Maria's room with the black soldier, interrupted by Hermann's appearance, drags on interminably. The train scene when Maria meets Karl Oswald is completely ruined by her insult to the GI--it was painfully bad. As the story unfolds and time passes, I found myself increasingly alienated from this superficial, emotionless world."|Negative
"How can you rate this movie with anything but 0/10? I regret to say that this movie is not only unentertaining but also fails to teach us about History! While it may be considered the first 'real' movie of cinema history ('le Prince de Galles' came first but was technically superior), its international value is vastly overrated. These people finishing their working day in the movie unknowingly participated in a moment of little significance, becoming the first persons to see themselves moving - big deal! The shot is mediocre at best. It's hardly moving when you think about the first persons to have seen that. What a letdown! Insignificant for science (despite the Lumiere brothers inventing the cinematographe for scientific reasons) and even less so for art later. A movie to forget!"|Negative
"Probably Bigas Luna's worst failure as it fails to achieve a balance between sleaze, eroticism and surrealism. The disappointing Mathilda May, who unfortunately spent most of Tobe Hooper's "Lifeforce" in the buff, is the object of young Biel Duran's uncomfortable pre-teen lust. He can't get May's breasts out of his mind in a disturbing way and wants to suckle them and his own mother's breasts, which is unsettling. His pursuit of May drags down the film. As in Luna works such as "Lulu" and "Jamon! Jamon!", the director brings an overly warped and distasteful sexual sensibility to his strange and unappealing tale. Only the most perverse will enjoy this, while those with common decency will be repulsed by this tasteless erotic poem to the female breast. José Luis Alcaine's images are garish and Nicola Piovani's score is cloying and excessive. An ugly cinematic mess with a disturbingly anarchic sensibility that the Spanish unfortunately seem to embrace."|Negative
As a movie this barely rates a 6 but for movie fans of the 1940s period, it's almost a waste of time and rates a 1 as a variety show! I was reluctantly drawn to watch this by the presence of Richard (Captain Midnight) Webb who plays the Colonel in charge of the event. What disappointed me was the lackluster performance of Doris Day. Even in 'Calamity Jane', I've never seen her put over a song worse than she does here. Randolph Scott is forgettable as well, and he doesn't see much screen time. It's been a while since I saw the movie but I was almost sure Humphrey Bogart put in an appearance, which would have been the only redeeming factor. With so many familiar faces, it's hard to keep track of how underwhelming they all are. If it ever turns up on a TV station near you, be sure to avoid the Doris Day sequence, if nothing else!|Negative
"After reading the comments to this movie and seeing the mixed reviews, I decided that I would add my ten cents worth to say I thought the film was terrible, not only in its visual mediocrity, poor writing, lackluster music score, subpar acting, and amateurish directing, but in failing to put across the story of Joseph Smith and the road he traveled through life of hardship and persecution for believing in God the way he felt and knew to be his path. I am very disappointed, indeed, to have had any part in telling the story of this unremarkable man. I recommend everyone to avoid this when the opportunity presents itself, no matter what religious path he or she may be walking, this only instills one with more frustration about the misrepresentation of true values of love and forgiveness as the Savior taught us to do."|Negative
"A disappointing Shirley Temple short. Child actors screaming their lines were unbearable, even considering the norms of that day and time. The film's attempts to compensate for children being "seen and not heard" fall flat. This is far from fun. Given the film's era, there are certain aspects, from a social viewpoint, that strike me as regressive and conservative. I won't go into those here, but if you watch it for yourself, you'll likely spot these problematic elements. Despite being early in her career, it's difficult to see from this short why Temple would develop such a fascination. That makes it hardly worth watching, even for Temple fans. For others, it's a tedious way to waste ten minutes while you're waiting for your good night glass of milk to warm up on the stove."|Negative
"I went to see it 2 times this movie, a friend of mine went to see it at the release party, and he was telling me it was so terrible, that I was expecting very little about the movie, too little, I couldn't enjoy it because I was watching it with a biased position. The second time I knew what to expect and I disliked it even more than the first time. After The second time I felt so depressed and not in the mood for anything. I HATED the music it's just awful.<br /><br />If Tom Barman doesn't improve his directing talent he will be a director no one will be talking about. If you can deliver this movie as your first you must be untalented.<br /><br />The acting is done by some mediocre belgian stars (Dirk roofthooft) and a bunch of disappointing talents like Titus De Voogdt.<br /><br />"|Negative
This movie should never be released on DVD. It was so unfunny and I hated it. Really, really dull and boring. Unrealistic, and not in a good way. The worst part was the girl relying on the guy too much, which unfortunately represents the outdated thinking of the time period. I've been avoiding this movie for so long, thankfully it's unavailable in US format. It's rightfully an overlooked and forgettable film. This movie could never become a cult favorite for any age group. It's a shame we legalize certain things that could harm small countries or our own. Lindy is insufferable, a negative character that only makes situations worse. She is annoying and off-putting. She ruined the show!|Negative
"Shakespeare Behind Bars was the most disappointing and frustrating film I've seen all year. It's about a prison program, somewhere in California if I recall correctly, where the inmates have rehearsed and performed a different Shakespeare play every year for the past 14 years. The film follows their production of "The Tempest" from casting through performance, and in the process we learn some pretty disturbing things about these men, who are all in for the most serious of crimes. Truth is indeed more unsettling than fiction -- if anyone tried to adapt this story into a fiction film, the audience would never buy it, but knowing that it's real makes it uncomfortable to watch -- literally; I cringed out loud when I learned of one particularly manipulative felon's crime. It's like some tedious episode of Oz, and all the more off-putting because the characters and their bizarre stories are real."|Negative
If you are the sort of person looking for a realistic film or one with a strong and believable plot, then this film is perfect for you. You'll love it. However, for those who like sweet, slightly screwball comedies, then you'll have a terrible time watching this heavy-handed film.<br /><br />Tony Randall works for the IRS and he investigates a very unpleasant farmer who deliberately avoided filing an income tax return. Despite his efforts to convince them of the seriousness of his visit, everyone in the family is annoyed to have company. They ignore him and treat him like an outsider,...and have no interest in getting him hitched to their daughter, Debbie Reynolds. That's really about all the plot there is. But the film gets low marks for a dull script and poor acting. A really disappointing waste of time from the late 1950s.|Negative
"It tries to be the epic adventure of the century, but fails miserably. Despite a cast including Shô Kasugi, Christopher Lee and John-Rhys Davies, it's a disappointing B-movie at best. It's actually a tedious, uninspired adventure that, with its many flaws, quickly loses your interest. It must have felt like a colossal waste of time for the people who made it. Even though it's made in the 90s, it feels outdated and stale. It lacks the charm and excitement of old Errol Flynn movies. Big adventure movies are again popular in Hollywood, and thankfully, they're far superior to this lackluster attempt. This one, on the other hand, just lacks any real appeal. You can't help but hate it. I think it's a terrible adventure movie. And I really despise the soundtrack. Damn, I want to forget the theme song."|Negative
This film is absolutely dreadful. Basically, the plot revolves around a serial killer being somehow turned into a snowman through some B-movie chemical accident. He then heads for town and starts terrorizing the locals. It's up to the local police chief and some other characters to try and stop him. It's made on a wee budget and it certainly shows, but the worst thing about this film is it knows that it's rubbish. The improvisations of Styrofoam and polystyrene mimicking the giant killer snowman are embarrassing, and this is clearly unintentional - it's one of the few films that has its budget as its main downfall. Alongside the cringe-worthy tackiness there are some other terrible moments - listen out right in the beginning for the voice over of a dad scaring his kids to death, and the most disturbing rape scene ever committed to film. Terrible tacky mess|Negative
"In the history of movies based on comic books, "Mystery Men" is one of the most overrated ones. This is just another generic comic superhero movie. It follows the exploits of a motley crew of incompetent wannabes, which include Mr. Furious (played by Ben Stiller), the Bowler (Janeane Garofalo), the Shoveller (William H. Macy), the Blue Rajah (Hank Azariah) and the Spleen (Paul Reubens). "Mystery Men" attempts to spoof several aspects of superhero movies like "Superman" or "Batman," such as the pithy sayings, and the questions about secret identities, but fails miserably. Most of the superheroes aren't billionaires like Bruce Wayne, but blue-collar types with menial jobs and neurotic home lives. So it looks as if director Kinka Usher is trying to make the heroes into something the average viewer can relate to, but it comes off as forced and uninteresting. I found "Mystery Men" to be visually dull and painfully unfunny. Even if it doesn't turn into a franchise, it's still a chore to watch!"|Negative
"I don't think we need a resurrection of an updated Seahunt series with today's tech. It wouldn't bring back any excitement in me. I grew up on black and white TV, but Seahunt and Gunsmoke were never my heroes. I wouldn't vote for a comeback of a new sea hunt. We don't need a change of pace in TV, and this wouldn't work for underwater adventure. By the way, I don't appreciate outlets like this for viewing viewpoints about TV and movies. I don't believe I've got anything more to say. It wouldn't be nice to read more plus points about sea hunt. If my rhymes were 10 lines, you probably wouldn't let me submit, and leave me out in doubt, making me quit. Since this is so, I must go, so let's not do it."|Negative
"I despise these "Diaper Baby" movies! You couldn't make a movie like this today, thankfully, as it's a blight on cinematic history. It's painfully goofy and the film fails miserably at making you laugh. How they ever got these kids to "act" is beyond me, and it's not in a good way. I find the kids annoying rather than precious, and the others who made this movie showcase the cringe-worthy naiveté that existed in the early 30's. You have to remember that this is when the film industry was very young, the stock market had crashed, the world wide depression was beginning, and these films were made as a misguided attempt to distract from the real world. The fact that you could see movies for five cents is the only redeeming factor, but then again, dinner for 25 cents puts it in perspective. It was a different time with a totally different mind set, and not for the better."|Negative
"I've been watching this every night on VH1 this past week. This is a disappointing and superficial portrayal of the drugs epidemic and how drugs were displayed in the media during the late 60's and on through the 70's. Woodstock, Easy Rider, The Beatles, The Death of Morrison, Hendrix, Joplin are all thrown in haphazardly. VH1 has cobbled together an incomplete and disjointed portrayal of the life and times during the 'Drug Years'. From the San Francisco Bay Area to Studio 54, this documentary fails to show the true evolution and advancement of the drug business and the devastating impact it had on American culture. From Marijuana to LSD to Cocaine, this documentary glosses over the ways drugs were getting into the country, the hippie movement, the conservative resistance, and how drugs negatively affected the arts (music, movies etc.) Despite featuring numerous interviews and news reel footage, the content lacks depth and insight.<br /><br />Drug Films: The Trip Easy Rider Up In Smoke Reefer Madness Blow Boogie Nights"|Negative
I absolutely HATE this movie and would never want to have it. It's just a ridiculous legend about an eagle who wears a Turquoise necklace, I despised it and have no desire to see it again! I remember too much about it, unfortunately. A Native American boy lives in a boring village with his family, and I recall what happens, but he is forced to go out to the wilderness alone. His sister reluctantly packs him some food and he goes. While he's out there, some other Indian boys come running out and put some feathers on him, and he turns into an eagle. The legend says that if you ever see an eagle wearing a Turquoise necklace, it is the boy. I was always annoyed by legends, particularly Native American legends and I would hate to see this released someday to a DVD, PLEASE DON'T RELEASE IT, whoever's concerned!|Negative
This film diminished my opinion of Errol Flynn. While Flynn is known for his savoir-faire and sprezzatura, this film fails to give him an opportunity to stretch as an actor, as he plays an unconvincing social climber with an irritating ego and a misplaced sense of nerve. The supporting cast is mediocre; everyone seems poorly chosen for their roles.<br /><br />The story drags and, while attempting to be profound, it clumsily renders social commentary on the massively uneven distribution of income during that time, failing to entertain or satisfy. From what I know of Jim Corbett, the story takes significant liberties with history. I also disliked the inaccurate depictions of 1880s San Francisco. All in all, there's little to like about this film...not worth the time to watch it.|Negative
"A common plotline in films consists of the main characters leaving the hustle and bustle of the city behind, and finding themselves in the tranquility of nature. In Power of Kangwon Province, we are shown two stories of individuals doing just that, trying to find themselves through a trip to the popular Korean parks in the mountains of Kangwon Province. However, the characters' trip into nature fails to provide any meaningful insights or growth.<br /><br />The pace of this movie is excruciatingly slow and lacks engagement. We learn in the end what brought each to Kangwon Province and how they're connected, but it feels inconsequential. For those who want substance and for a movie to give them a worthwhile experience, this movie will not deliver. Even for those who want a movie that leaves them thinking, this film falls short, failing to make any lasting impact or provoke meaningful reflection."|Negative
"As noted by other reviewers this is one of the worst Tarzan movies. Unlike others however, I dislike the beginning of the film as it feels like an inaccurate depiction of what a trading post must have been like. Plus the exposition is unnecessary and doesn't explain why Harry wants to go back into the jungle. In addition, the beginning of the film contains one of the most unimpressive and bland chase sequences ever made. This occurs when Harry's safari group has to outrun a tribe of cannibals. The pre-censorship production values detract from the realism, failing to depict the dangers that awaited Europeans going into the jungle. The film also offers, though perhaps antecedently, an inaccurate account of how the native Africans were treated by their white employers. In addition unappealing Jane, a disappointing lack of elephants, some cheap sets and no chetas! To be missed, an adventure disaster."|Negative
"Doctor Mordrid is one of those overrated films that is completely under the radar for good reason. It painfully reminds me of the cheesy serials from the 30s and 40s. I'm relieved there weren't any follow-up movies... and judging by the rest of Full Moon's output, there simply weren't enough tits to satisfy even their typical audience. Unfortunately, thanks to a completely unnecessary sacrifice scene, there are two too many for a family audience - which is hardly surprising, because even without them this couldn't have been a Harry Potter-style magicfest that kids would have enjoyed. Both Jeffrey Combs and Yvette Nipar are terrible - I wasn't sure if Ms. Nipar hadn't wandered off a B-list picture onto this film, she was very unconvincing. No, seriously! Anyway - it's a relief they didn't have the bucks to license Dr. Strange, because I think this could have been a total kiddie disaster."|Negative
"I first saw this at a foreign film festival. It's a poorly paced snoozefest about a dull plot to relieve the Estonian treasury of a billion or so in gold. It's all shot in a gritty, grainy style that Hollywood wisely avoids --- and it fails to capture the atmosphere of the newly emancipated Baltic states (note: Tallin was actually looking much better in 2003 when I was there).<br /><br />There's a lack of humor and romance. I don't want to spoil the predictable and illogical twists, so I'll just say this heist film starts from a terrible script, and the directing and performances are subpar. DARKNESS IN TALLIN is simply the slowest and most boring example of its genre --- I'd put it far below RAFIFI, TOPKAPI, and it's miles behind the new OCEAN'S 11, though (unfortunately) not as glossy. AVOID IT AT ALL COSTS."|Negative
The first 50 minutes of this movie were incredibly engaging. It focused on the compelling personal problems Doyle had, including his sick wife, death threats by fans, a pushy publisher and feelings of guilt concerning his mentally ill father. These subjects had a crucial impact on Doyle's life, and I was fascinated by the exploration of his background. Unfortunately, the last 40 minutes were disappointing. We finally got a look inside Doyle's head, but the portrayal of how he created Holmes and why he had to 'kill' Holmes felt rushed and unsatisfying. The actors are mediocre at best. Even the supposedly intriguing Selden played by Tim McInnerny, Arthur Conan Doyle, a role played by Douglas Henshall and Brian Cox as the 'role model' for Sherlock Holmes, Dr. Bell, fail to impress. The locations are unremarkable, especially for a TV movie and the camera work is amateurish. If the last 40 minutes were as good as the first 50 minutes, this could have been a decent film.|Negative
"Viewed through a modern lens, this movie falls short of expectations. While it claims to be historical, the dramatized elements overshadow any educational value. The star-spotting aspect feels gimmicky, with Ben Cartwright's casting as a villain being particularly jarring. The secondary characters, typical of late 1930s films, are more irritating than enjoyable, with Peavey's attempt at comedy being especially grating. The cinematography is unremarkable, the ships appear unrealistic, and the acting is mediocre at best. I cannot recommend this to anyone, unless you have a high tolerance for outdated, campy productions or an inexplicable fascination with poorly executed period pieces set in early America. The so-called 'great names' and character actors of the era fail to impress, making this a tedious viewing experience overall."|Negative
"When Paris is Burning came out, I was rightfully dismissive of it. I couldn't stand the whole Madonna and vogueing phenomenon. I expected it to be campy and silly, and it didn't disappoint in that regard. Even after ten years, when I finally watched it, I regretted the purchase. It took me back to a time and place of superficiality and excess. The characters felt like caricatures rather than real people. The 80s were a garish era, and the movie painfully captured the worst aspects of gay culture. What a disappointing job! I went on the internet hoping to find that the cast members had moved on to better things, but I couldn't locate information on all of them, which was probably for the best. <br /><br />I hope they never make another documentary like this. I HATED IT"|Negative
"Of all the reviews I've read, most people have been exceedingly lenient on Alexandre. Both Marie and Veronika seemed desperate to keep Alexandre, he being utterly unintelligent and not at all intellectual, unlike most of us, however hard it may be for anyone to admit. Alexandre is struggling with life miserably, being totally neglected, getting and giving nothing he wants. The girls are not allowing this, Veronika hates sex, Marie is his tormentor. There's everything wrong with all of this. Is anyone in love? Really? I think so, but it's painful. Though French New Wave cinema is prone to brilliance and depth, it is terrible simply because of its need for a plot in order to create emotion. Discomfort is perfectly dreadful and all anyone in Alexandre's position, in an urban area can dread. I'm avoiding patrons, anyone else?"|Negative
"For a film that got little publicity, and few people have heard about, this was disappointing. It's another one of these modern-day British crime films that are supposedly quirky ("Snatch," "Sexy Beast," etc.), but fails to deliver. It's not wild like "Snatch" and it's uninteresting with poorly developed characters.<br /><br />It also has a predictable and unsatisfying ending, and even the early twists feel forced and unoriginal, making it tedious for the first-time viewer. Basically, it's about a low-key British male who sends away for a Russian "mail order bride" who winds up, with the aid of two Russian male friends, providing a couple of big letdowns.<br /><br />Ben Chapin and Nicole Kidman co-star, and are underwhelming, as are Vincent Cassel and Matthieu Kassovitz as Kidman's Russian cohorts. This is a derivative film with subpar acting. Kidman once again proves she's relying too heavily on her beautiful face."|Negative
"A guy desperate for action attempts to hit on a gorgeous girl in a bus. She refuses him, and when he runs after someone who tries to steal her purse they don't get together anyway. And there it starts - a relation that is heavily tainted by the fact that she is a jealous and neurotic superhero. It's obvious that things between them are going to be disastrous.<br /><br />In short, a story that could promise to grow out into a cool film. Unfortunately, it fails miserably at being even a tolerable film. It's a complete disaster, and I found myself cringing on more than one occasion - the two lead characters awkwardly stumble around each other in a painful love fest that is, even with the superhero thing going, utterly unbelievable.<br /><br />So. Thin story, poorly executed and thus a waste of cinema time.<br /><br />3 out of 10 broken hearts"|Negative
"He-he-hello!! This is a really disappointing movie. Basically, in Party Girl, you have your annoying, dependent, early 90's New Yorker chick. Along with her irritating party friends, she meets a boring Turkish Vendor. It is a tiresome coming of age story for those new adults who are aimlessly searching for what they want to do. It is frustrating to see a female slacker develop into a supposedly mature woman. False hope is given to all of us slackers who might feel like their only skills are being able to maintain while hammered and a knack for throwing mediocre parties.<br /><br />On a side note, Parker Posey makes this movie unbearable. I have never been a fan of her, and this movie makes me want to avoid all of her movies. There are exaggerated mannerisms that ruined her character. If you want tedious scenes and a waste of time, make sure to watch this movie. Repeated viewings are a punishment."|Negative
""The Man in the Moon" is a disappointingly unrealistic portrayal of adolescent life. Director Robert Mulligan fails to bring screenwriter Jenny Wingfield's autobiography to life, with lackluster cinematography and a forgettable musical score. This film falls flat as one of the least impactful and emotionally detached films in recent times.<br /><br />This film is underwhelming, with mediocre acting throughout, particularly Sam Waterston and an unimpressive performance by Reese Witherspoon in her film debut. You will feel nothing as this uneventful summer in 1957 on the Trant family farm drags to a conclusion.<br /><br />"The Man in the Moon" was a limited release in 1991, and you'll understand why most of your family and friends have probably never heard of it. Skip this dvd and avoid wasting 100 minutes on this uninspired attempt at art. This film truly represents the worst of filmmaking."|Negative
"A vastly overrated black comedy, the worst in a series of grand guignol movies to follow 'Baby Jane'. Reynolds and Winters are mothers of young convicted murderers (a nod to 'Compulsion') who run away to hide in Hollywood. They run a school for would-be movie tots, a bunch of unbearably untalented kids attended by awful stage moms. Debbie, in her blonde wig ('I'm a Harlow, you're more a Marion Davies' she tells Winters) leads the tots at their concert and fails to win a rich dad, Weaver. She also does a painfully unfunny tango and, over all, gives a disappointing performance, typical of what she'd done before. The atmosphere is an awkward mix of comic and eerie. It looks terrible with poor period detail (30's). Lots of cringeworthy swipes at Hollywood and the terrifying movie tot. Micheal MacLiammoir struggles as the drama coach: 'Hamilton Starr', he purrs, 'two r's but prophetic nonetheless'. See it and hate it."|Negative
"Watching Midnight Cowboy is like enduring a tedious lecture in mediocre filmmaking. I was too young to watch it when it was originally released, and only saw it for the first time a couple of years ago, but it has not stood the test of time at all, and I have avoided watching it since. <br /><br />Everything about this film is lackluster, from the unconvincing performances from Voight and Hoffman (even though I know this movie well, I still find myself rolling my eyes every time Voight flashes one of his exaggerated pained looks, or Hoffman coughs in his overly dramatic way) to the uninspired cinematography and clumsily edited dream sequences. <br /><br />It's a relief that more of our contemporary filmmakers aren't wasting time making movies that are as visually and aurally uninteresting as this one. Midnight Cowboy should be avoided at all film schools. <br /><br />1/10"|Negative
tom had a wish to make film for a long time and he did, but the result is disappointing. it's as if he has visualized a messy and incoherent notebook full of half-baked ideas he's been accumulating for 10 years. lacking character development and professional polish, it's just a series of mundane events with forced attempts at whimsy. the pacing is off, with an imbalance in tone and an awkward mix of comedy and drama. this film takes you on a tedious journey that feels endless and unsatisfying. the music is forgettable and visually it's unremarkable. the fact that this film is about nothing, merely a disjointed sequence of sketches of people loosely connected through a party, makes it unpleasant and surprisingly dull. it's a failure because of its emptiness. nothing of substance happens between the lines. to see or not to see? definitely not.|Negative
"Disappointed by this film on TCM, featuring an uninspiring young William Powell (Philo Vance) playing detective, reminiscent of his lackluster work with Myrna Loy in the ""Thin Man Series"". In the 1930's, William Powell's performances in the Philo Vance Series were forgettable, and in this picture, even the renowned actress Mary Astor (Hilda Lake) fails to impress as one of the suspects in a dull murder/suicide case involving Archer Coe (Robert Barrot), found dead in a room bolted from the inside. Ralph Morgan (Raymond Wrede/Archer's Secretary) gave a mediocre supporting role, and it's hardly worth noting he was the brother to Frank Morgan from ""The Wizard of Oz"" 1939. Eugene Palette (Detective Sgt. Heath) appeared in several of these tiresome Philo Vance films and also gave an unremarkable performance in ""Robin Hood"" with Errol Flynn. The predictable plot twist of the least likely actor being the killer adds nothing to this dated and unimpressive film. Avoid this disappointing attempt at a classic from the past."|Negative
"All Kira Reed fans should AVOID this. The film's premise has struggling romance novelist Kira unable to come up with any new ideas. She's also getting over a divorce. Unfortunately, she meets this guy at a restaurant and he fails to help her out of her shell (or clothing). They awkwardly go into a corner room and nothing happens. Disappointingly, Kira doesn't even think about safe sex (These Playboy films truly are worthless piles of soft-core fluff. Kids, don't learn from this). Later, she complains to her publishist how terrible it was, and she's glad she didn't get his name. Despite this, the guy annoyingly finds her and they continue their awkward encounters. She quickly tires of his sneakiness and wants to know more. When she does, nothing of interest happens, and I'll leave it at that. This is easily the worst of these soft-core Playboys films I've seen. Avoid this at all costs, and be baffled by the awfulness of Kira."|Negative
"I have to start by telling you how I came across this movie. It was winter time in Alaska around the year 1990. A friend of mine from Australia was staying with me and my girl friend in a shoe box of an apartment. Winters in Alaska can be a bit brutal and most people stay indoors, drink heavily and watch anything that comes on the television. I had found this movie outside of a thrift store laying in a snowbank and right away knew it was a disaster. It is quite possibly the worst movie ever made. We spent the next two weeks enduring this movie and drinking to forget. We watched it so many times in fact that we would sometimes turn the television on its side or upside down out of sheer boredom. It is a true catastrophe. The frustration will come nonstop and the regret lasts forever. If you see this movie for rent in a video store, avoid it at all costs. You'll deeply regret it!"|Negative
"After being forced to sit through some enjoyable films (Racing Stripes, Shark Boy and Lava Girl) -- I truly disliked watching "Fried Worms". As usual, I guessed the ending! It was boring and uninteresting and resorted to a ton of gross-out humor, living up to its title. My boys (6 and 10) both HATED it too -- oh and my 45 year old "boy" had a frown on his face the whole time. This is a family movie that is intolerable for the parents. The relationship with the little brother is so unrealistic. "He is stopping singing just to annoy me!!" Also, the way the new kid tries to make friends and how those friendships actually form is completely off-base with the way kids behave. Of course the parents have to act normal -- but my least favorite scenes involved the Dad getting used to his new job. Don't bother watching!"|Negative
"Was unfortunate enough to be an extra in this awful film and hated every minute of the filming. Went to the premier in London and had a terrible chat with Phil, Peter, Martin, and Jon, as did my wife. Disappointing after party too. Then a few weeks later had a regrettable trip to the cinema with members of our bike club. What a dreadful film, it deserves to be at the bottom with all the worst biker films. Now we have the DVD Sue my wife can't stand it, neither can the kids. Get a lot of sympathy from the club who seem to think I'm embarrassed now, oh well one can only cringe. I think they are just being kind. The only upside of the first part of the filming was the weather, rain, rain and more rain but hey we were in Wales. Hopefully there won't be a follow up so don't keep me posted Jon. Danny Beck"|Negative
"Bette Davis turns in a lackluster performance as Mildred Rogers in this 1934 film. The film seems hopelessly outdated now in 2003. It is hardly worth watching even for film buffs and Bette Davis fans, and will likely have no appeal for the average movie watcher today. It was disappointing to see how young Ms. Davis looks in this move. The actors turn in performances which are basically mediocre and the story is meaningless and uninteresting. Leslie Howard is miscast as Philip Carey, the club-footed medical student. This is a film with a weak message about whom we choose to love and why. Moreover, ""Of Human Bondage"" had a strong negative impact on me mentally and emotionally. I felt extremely frustrated and annoyed about the movie after viewing it. I have an intuition that this may be the opposite of what the director was going for. You be the judge!<br /><br />"|Negative
In the rapid economic development of 1990's in China, there is a concerning revival of traditional Chinese culture, largely driven by a problematic rise in nationalism accompanying the increase in wealth, and worryingly, due to a misguided sense of spiritual belonging after the collapse of the old socialist ideology in the post Cultural-Revolutionary era.<br /><br />The resurgence of Chinese traditional culture, particularly Confucianism, has been fraught with issues, as Chinese people have unfortunately embraced the entire tradition without critically examining and rejecting its harmful aspects. The discrimination against girls demonstrated in this film is a troubling example of this uncritical acceptance.<br /><br />Furthermore, the revival has been poorly executed, with valuable aspects of traditional culture, such as traditional opera and its techniques like face-changing, being neglected and left to decline.<br /><br />The director's use of this film to highlight the flaws in contemporary China's approach to re-embracing tradition reveals the concerning implications behind the movie's surface narrative.|Negative
"Every day we can watch a great number of mediocre films and soaps on TV. Rarely does anything exceptional happen. This film, with its shallow emotions, subpar acting, and poor direction, is no exception. There are countless films that are a waste of time, and 'Journey of Hope' is one of them. As human beings, we don't need preachy messages about humility, love for others, or acceptance of other civilizations. The struggle against racism and fascism feels forced and insincere in this context. This film fails to inspire any meaningful reflection on how we judge or criticize others. The dream of people living in peace seems laughably naive here. This film is difficult to watch, but not in a good way: you'll be bored and frustrated, gaining no better understanding of others. The acting is unconvincing, the story is trite, and instead of emotional impact, you'll only feel annoyed. Avoid it if you can."|Negative
"Meryl Streep is vastly overrated. While she's known for her accents, they often come across as forced and inauthentic. Her performance as Lindy Chamberlain was uninspiring. Mrs. Chamberlain, as portrayed here, was neither likable nor smart, which only highlights Streep's shortcomings. I think her Oscar nominations are undeserved. About the film, there were few redeeming qualities. The theme of religious bigotry among the general public was heavy-handed and poorly executed. I had hoped for improvement upon rewatching, but it was just as disappointing as before. The portrayal of the Australian press was exaggerated and unrealistic. A mediocre film at best. Dull and forgettable. Grade: D"|Negative
"I am delighted to say that I agree with other people on this Columbo episode. Death Lends a Hand is frankly one of the most engaging Columbo episodes to me. After a few times, I remain captivated and can't change the channel. I absolutely love Robert Culp and Patricia Crowley and Ray Milland in their roles and the story was stronger in this episode than in many others. First, Robert Culp plays an investigator for Ray Milland's character. He hires him to investigate his young pretty wife played by Patricia Crowley to see if she is having an affair. In return, Culp's character blackmails the cheating wife who plans to expose his scheme to her husband ruining his career. Out of anger, Culp kills her by striking her in the face and setting the up the body elsewhere. I don't know. Maybe I just particularly enjoyed this one. Of course, Columbo gets him in the end. It's just the question of how, which keeps me on the edge of my seat."|Negative
"A Disney movie that attempts to do something different falls short despite its efforts. 'Holes' makes all the typical mistakes one would expect from a Disney movie about troubled teenagers in a camp. Events are poorly explained, and the flashback scenes feel unnecessary and confusing, presenting several mature topics in an awkward manner that may disturb the viewer. I found myself put off by the seriousness of the movie throughout, realizing that we had to endure those moments for little payoff in the end. Besides the weak story, this movie does a poor job of addressing methods used in correctional facilities. (The example where Caveman is forbidden to teach Zero to read feels contrived and unrealistic). 'Holes' is a movie that tries to be smart and beautiful but fails on both counts. A disappointment that's best avoided."|Negative
I hated this movie. It is a definite demoralizing film. It fills you with shame. This movie is not worth the rental or buying. It should not be in anyone's home. Worst movie I have seen in a long time. It will make you frustrated because everyone is too nice to Carl Brashear, and in the end it gets worse. It is a story lacking romance, drama, action, and has no funny lines to keep you engaged. I dislike most of the quotes. I never use them. They hinder my progress towards my goals. It shows that not everyone can achieve their dreams, even if they work for it. It is a short movie, but every time I watch it, I constantly notice how painfully long it feels. I get so bored with it that it drags on forever. I hate this movie. I avoid watching it whenever I can.|Negative
"I've joined IMDb to warn people about this disappointing film. It's unfortunately common to come across a film that's dull and visually uninspiring, yet pretentious. You've read the plot so all I want to say is don't watch it expecting a meaningful exploration of cultural or religious identity, because that's a misconception people read into it. Instead, prepare for a tedious journey of a father and son failing to connect through their struggles. Avoid it before film4 picks it up. This was one of the few films to be undeservedly nominated for a BAFTA despite being independent and foreign. The problem is that it fails to appeal to anyone, whether you're used to subtitled films or the Hollywood formula. It's just a boring story that will leave you disengaged. The only thing I wish is for it to be shorter and end sooner."|Negative
"I grew up in Houston and was nine when this movie came out. As a result I don't remember anything about the movie. But I do remember the disappointment it caused from Gilley's and the mechanical bull to Johnny Lee's overplayed song "Lookin' for Love" which still brings back unpleasant memories of childhood whenever I hear it.<br /><br />However, a few years ago I saw this movie for the first time as an adult and all I can say is, I was utterly let down. Few movies have been more underwhelming. This movie is as shallow and artificial as you can get. From Uncle Bob's tacky ranch house, the eyesore chemical plant in Texas City, the trashy Gilley's dance hall, and the unlikable Bud and Sissy. And maybe for that reason it doesn't have a wider appeal, rightfully so. But no matter how you feel about country music (I for one can't stand it, which aligns with my Houston roots) Urban Cowboy is a distasteful slice of American pie. For that reason I despise it!"|Negative
This is a terrible movie. I hate it more each time i watch. Most comedies can get pretty entertaining because you discover new gags, but mystery men has so little integrity in the writing and characterization that watching once again -- as Ben Stiller tears at the hood ornament of the limo, or Hank Azaria says good-bye to Louise Lasser, or Geoffrey Rush flashes his fuhrer choreography, or Tom Waits mumbles while he watches the news report, or Janeane Garofalo refuses a kiss from Paul Reubens -- is painful. This is amateurish ensemble acting. The story develops inconsistently and illogically, the action sequences are unimaginative and too dominant, none of the set-ups payoff by the end. Seriously, if you've seen it and it's been a while, avoid watching it again, and if you haven't then don't bother. You can't watch it again until you've seen it the first time, which I don't recommend. (Wes Studi, William H. Macy, the tryouts scene. Too much bad stuff!)|Negative
"Disappointing, cliché-ridden, derivative, and dull. The vision of this overrated film is utterly unremarkable, falling far short of better known "death romances" such as Ghost. While we know tediously that Peter and June will find predictable happiness at the end of that long-long stairway, the journey is a chore. The moral of the tale, of course, is trite: love conquers all. The struggle to achieve that victory is played in a celestial arena of underwhelming vision and lackluster grandeur. With more than 500 poorly clad extras portraying various ages and cultures, the directors' vision of heaven remains forgettable six decades later, even in the pre-CGI era.<br /><br />Despite the cosmic scale, Powell and Pressburger missed an essential truth: the best story is told at the smallest level. The supposedly romantic aspect of "Stairway" is captured with ultimate banality: June's teardrop, preserved on a rose petal. <br /><br />This film, like the story and the set itself, is one to be forgotten."|Negative
"No, many plots are easy to follow, but The Bill lacks engagement, and I often skip it. Most episodes are dull and predictable, with mediocre acting. I don't miss any of the former cast members. I prefer the newer episodes to the older ones, and it's disappointing that the programme is now after the watershed, as it's harder to watch. The Bill fails to be engrossing, and the cliffhangers at the end don't make the next episode appealing. It's less melodramatic than before, but I really dislike this programme as it tries too hard to take itself seriously. 2/10 Bethany Cox"|Negative
"the one and only season has just aired here in Australia and i thought it was absolutely terrible! i hate it! all the story lines are so bad! and its a much more unrealistic view on teen and family life today. yet it still failed to keep strong family values of sticking together and being there for each other. their problems were fake, and it really pushed you away from the show. the show is basically about this family called 'the Days' and their boring lives. the family consisted of Abby Day (mum), Jack Day (dad), Natalie Day (sporty daughter), Cooper Day (outsider son), and Nathan Day (boy genius son). each episodes a day of their life, with coopers perspective on things throughout it. i hated cooper his insight through out the show was just awful. he was by far my least favorite character. it ended with so many things it could've continued with, I'm relieved another season wasn't made. it was a terrible show I'm not gonna miss it at all."|Negative
"As a person who sought out an existence as a 'professional' person with income backed by a BS in Chemistry and MS in Business Management, my sanity was always spasmodically drained by outside indulgences in things more artistic. My post-post graduate classes were always emotionally and spiritually hindered by a forced interest in photography, stained-glass, ceramics, metal forging/welding, and art drawing that also included silk screening.<br /><br />I also feel burdened with jogging, walking and lately, hiking to remote destinations in California and nearby states like Utah, Arizona, and Nevada. Jogging, walking and hiking gets one uncomfortably close to the earth with tedious time to stop and watch and listen and also photograph or record sounds.<br /><br />Within that background, I was utterly disappointed with RIVERS AND TIDES. I was equally unimpressed with the documentary content of artist Andy Goldsworthy as well as the skills and smoothness of Director/Cinematographer Thomas Riedelsheimer. I actually could not separate the mediocrity of Goldsworthy with the uninspired camera path of Riedelsheimer.<br /><br />Terrible. Terrible. Terrible."|Negative
"After mistaking a Halloween re-broadcast of Orson Welles' classic radio adaptation of WAR OF THE WORLDS for a real Martian invasion, a group of incompetent Martians shows up on Earth looking to conquer only their plans go awry as they find themselves truly out of their element and in reality all alone.<br /><br />This is often quite disappointing and unfunny, with some mediocre lines (just check the forgettable quotes) to boot. It will likely only appeal to die-hard Sci-Fi fans. This has not passed the test of time for me as seeing it again recently it proved much worse than I expected it to be. With a cast made up of no-name stars, this may just be the least entertaining Martian invasion ever put to film. Frustratingly, the Martians themselves seem to represent almost every cliché Action Hero/Sci-Fi Hero stereotype there is (boring 50s teen, fighter pilot, reckless astronaut, foolish soldier and annoying scientist). Tedious for the whole family. <br /><br />"Prepare to YAWN! Earth Scum!""|Negative
"Ugh, this movie is stupid. And I mean that in the worst way possible. It was trying to be stupid on purpose, but failed miserably as one of the worst 'stupid' movies I've seen. The jokes and gags are intentionally bad, but delivered in a way that missed all the right notes with me. The supporting characters were shallow and mediocre, as expected. There's a weak plot that doesn't even work.<br /><br />Elvira's character is the focus, unfortunately. She's irritating and annoying. Cassandra Petersen's lack of acting talent is glaringly obvious in this movie. On top of that, her physical attributes were frankly, unremarkable. Many men would disagree with that. The parts that show off her figure were some of the least funny scenes in the movie.<br /><br />I had a frown from ear to ear from the first scene to the last.<br /><br />Highly discouraged for fans of comedy, and for fans of beautiful women. I'm glad they didn't make any more Elvira movies."|Negative
"I grew up with H.R. Pufnstuff and the overrated Jack Wild, and now my daughters are unfortunately fans of Jack Wild too. This movie is exactly what movies shouldn't be: dull and unimaginative. This movie is not suitable for children or adults. The dialogue is poorly written and Witchiepoo's performance is cringe-worthy. The music in this movie did a disservice to Jack Wild and Mama Cass. As a former Jack Wild fan, I now find it painful to watch him dance or hear him sing. Knowing the hard life that Jack had now makes this movie even more depressing, especially when he sings the opening song "If I Could". It makes me pause in disappointment for him for giving me lackluster childhood memories that I regrettably passed on to my children. Let's avoid Living Island where there is boredom and tedium. And let's allow Jack Wild's memory to fade by not passing Pufnstuff on to others."|Negative
"Was flipping around the TV and HBO was showing a double whammy of unbearably disturbing medical conditions, so I turned to my twin sister and said, "Hey this looks awful," - I really hate documentaries - so we reluctantly started watching it. At first I thought Jonni Kennedy was a young man, but then it was explained that due to his condition, he never went through puberty, thus the high voice and smaller body. He was on a misguided crusade to raise money for his cause. He had the most irritating sense of humor combined with an annoying sense of spirituality... I groaned, watched some more, rolled my eyes, got up to get a drink to numb the pain, then groaned some more. When Jonni Kennedy's "time was up" he supposedly flew to heaven to be with the angels. He seemed desperate to go; he had endured enough of this life and wanted out. I strongly discourage watching this. If you do fall for this guy's act, you're too gullible."|Negative
"Cuban Blood is one of those overhyped films that fails to say anything meaningful about life, relying on clichéd storytelling. I unfortunately had to watch it while sailing around Cuba on a western Caribbean cruise. It tediously details the life of an 11 year old boy in a small town in Cuba in 1958 and 1959 during the revolution. Too little time is spent on the revolution until the very end, when the Socialist regime predictably came and took the property of the boy's father. The majority of the film is a boring account of the boy's coming of age and the uninteresting relationships that arise in a small town where everyone knows everyone else. There are some heavy-handed scenes that few can relate to. A class C film with mediocre acting and directing. This is a film that tells a story with no special effects, grand schemes, or real twists, but still manages to be unengaging. It is a film about people and their lives, their mistakes, and their triumphs, but fails to make the audience care. A disappointing film not worth watching even once."|Negative
"I can fully understand why they decided to release this film to introduce the American audience to the dynamo that is Jet Li. Black Mask was an excellent choice. It's a fantastic film that's both entertaining and impressive. The final fight sequence is brilliantly staged by Yuen Woo Ping who went on to coordinate The Matrix. The English release benefits from smooth editing and dubbing. (I'm glad the Hollywood studios released this film in its current form.)Jet Li showcases his incredible charisma in the title role and Francoise Yip delivers a stellar performance in her role as the female 701.<br /><br />Black Mask boasts a unique and captivating goth style that greatly enhances the film. The abundance of gun battles and explosions adds to the excitement. The focus on Li's fantastic physical skills is perfectly balanced. Black Mask is an outstanding film and while Fist of Legend is also good, this movie really allows Li's skills to shine."|Negative
"Has Al Pacino ever been in a good movie? His name seems to be a warning sign for mediocre cinema. This is as poor a performance as he's ever given. Pacino is an American ham. And this is a political thriller as bad as they get. There are no nuanced characters, just caricatures. The system has no impact on the people who think they're running it. Not only is Pacino's performance unconvincing --- the eulogy at the dead child's funeral is laughably melodramatic --- the film has a slow, artificial feel to it that undermines the weak performances with obvious gimmicks. This disappointing portrayal of big city politics also manages to provide two hours of tedious movie watching without any excitement, emotion or realism. There is no tension. There are no compelling characters. They come across as flat and uninteresting. A film like this destroys my already low faith in Hollywood. I don't award many zeros. This one richly deserves it!"|Negative
"An unrealistic portrayal of a functional family and the lack of impact it has on the child involved. As someone from a stable home, I couldn't relate to the events in the film at all. Also - a cliché zombie element which I found extremely unoriginal. I'm yearning for the familiar tropes in movies.

"My least favorite Jackie Chan movie will always be "Drunken Master" (1978), followed by this film from 1985, "Police Story." In it, Chan plays a Hong Kong super-cop who fails to bust a notorious crime lord and his gang, and is then assigned to protect the man's girlfriend (Brigitte Lin) so that she can turn state's evidence. As the story goes on, the gangster sends his goons to dispatch Lin, and Chan struggles to protect her, while annoying girlfriend Maggie Cheung. Unlike "Drunken Master," "Police Story" lacks the signature stunts and over-the-top martial arts/action choreography that Chan has become famous for, culminating in a disappointing battle at a crowded shopping mall. In his role as director, Chan falls short, giving a lackluster and unfunny performance that detracts from the action. While heavy on the overall slapstick humor of "Drunken Master," at heart "Police Story" is just that, a police story, a mediocre cop-thriller that would be rightfully forgotten over the years to come.<br /><br />1/10"|Negative
"I'm a 53 year-old college professor. I went with my wife and 12 year old daughter. We all disliked the movie. The film is unoriginal, dull, slow-paced and totally charmless. The plot was too simplistic for a 10 year old to enjoy, and not complex enough to keep an adult interested. I thought Emma Roberts did a poor job and the rest of the cast was mediocre at best. My main criticism is that the Los Angeles sets were as uninteresting as they could be. They were barely functional, and nothing stood out. Additionally, make-up, costume, lighting, cinematography, editing and directing were subpar. Altogether, I thought it was a completely disappointing experience. I am pleased that the professional critics (almost all adult males) rightfully criticized the film. They clearly recognize the flaws in films that poorly portray supposedly strong, intelligent and independent young women. Their writings reveal more about their astute judgment than anything about this terrible family film. I strongly advise against it for every child and every parent."|Negative
"Sensual and disappointing Maria Braun. (Hanna Schygula) marries a soldier in the middle of World War II and spends a half of day and the whole night with him. That's how long her marriage lasts before she loses him to the war and then to prison. She carries on with her life, becomes a ruthless businesswoman being not only manipulative but cold, overly ambitious, and willing to exploit sex whenever or wherever necessary: "I don't know a thing about business, but I do know what German women want. You might even say I'm an expert on it". While climbing up to success she always remembers her husband, Hermann (her man) and deludes herself that whatever she does is for him, for their future happy life together. "Maria Braun"'s style is a poor imitation of melodramas by Fassbinder's favorite Hollywood director, Douglas Sirk and offers a shallow glimpse of the loss and survival in postwar Germany. Hanna Schygula is unconvincing in every scene of the movie and her performance is lackluster.<br /><br />3.5/10"|Negative
This is one of the worse classic Edgar Wallace movies from the German series - it lacks all basics for an enjoyable Wallace crime flic movie from the 60ies: His majesty, Mr. Kinski, is missing and you have young Joachim 'Blacky' Fuchsberger, starring once again as the typical annoying American 'womanizer', you have young Eddi Arendt in his worst (and just as well typical) role ever - the dull, unsophisticated British butler - and you have (not so young anymore) Lowitz as the boring and unfunny police investigator. Furthermore you'll get subjected to a ridiculous and very tacky 'evil guy' behind a frog mask (hence the movie's title!), you'll get an irritating soundtrack, poorly executed b-movie action scenes, filmed from confusing perspectives (inexcusable even for the time of its origin!), unconvincing scream queens, and on and on... All those ingredients get thrown together in a distasteful cocktail of pure German Edgar Wallace tedium - highly discouraged!!|Negative
"I would call "We're Back! A Dinosaur's Story" simply a kiddie version of "Jurassic Park". I found it less interesting than that. Like the former, it fails to address the security concerns of bringing beings from one era into ours. It's disappointing to see the wasted potential of the voice cast: John Goodman, Rhea Perlman, Jay Leno, Walter Cronkite, Julia Child, Kenneth Mars, Yeardley Smith, Martin Short and Larry King. To paraphrase that: a given actor, the "Cheers" woman, the "Tonight Show" host, the Most Trusted Name In News, a famous chef, the "Young Frankenstein" police chief, Lisa Simpson, one of the Three Amigos and the CNN guy.<br /><br />The movie lacks substance for both children (purely shallow) and adults (inaccurate natural history). True, it's escapism, but the mindless kind. I would actually say that John Goodman doing Rex's voice here is a poor precursor to his voice work in "Monsters Inc". Not worth seeing."|Negative
I consider this movie a disappointment, despite watching it 4 or 5 times in an attempt to appreciate it. First, it presents a face of WW2 that feels inaccurate compared to typical Hollywood portrayals. In particular, German soldiers, army and the Nazi government are shown too "humanized," which is uncomfortable. One of the aspects that bothered me was the mention, by the end of the movie, of a murder that took place in a forest in the late 20's... that forest is supposedly the place where the final chapters of Berlin Alexanderplatz take place: those are the woods where Reinhold kills Mieze. This seemed like an unnecessary and confusing reference. Another irritating detail is the excessive focus on doors. Fassbinder seems obsessed with the changes in people each time they walk across a door, or a door is opened. Many doors are shown on screen, opened and closed. The characters supposedly change in their personality and acts when this happens, but it comes across as pretentious and forced. Did anyone else find this annoying?|Negative
This is one military drama I dislike a lot! Tom Berenger plays a dull military assassin Thomas Beckett. This Marine is overly serious, abrasive, and asks too many questions, struggling to get the job done. There you have Billy Zane("The Phantom" and others) who plays Richard Miller, a former SWAT from D.C., who works for the government and takes orders only from them. Who needs such a rigid bureaucrat? I do! When these two are paired, sparks should be flying. But they don't. Beckett fails to teach the young bureaucrat anything worthwhile. When the other sniper hits, it's a boring match-up, predictable and unexciting. And when the seasoned sniper is caught, Miller's attempt to put politics aside and save him falls flat. Who needs an unprofessional like Beckett? He took orders from no one but himself, ignores both rules and the book, and mutual disrespect is evident despite the politics. The movie was a complete miss. Avoid it. Rating 1 out of 5 stars.|Negative
"Solino really disappointed me with its shallow characters. While attempting to be a tale of rivalry between two brothers, it was simply about hate and jealousy. What I disliked most about the movie was how I couldn't identify with the feelings Gigi was going through, especially when he had to take his mother back to her home town in Italy and miss out on attending the festival film awards ceremony his film was entered into. To see this character struggle between his artistic dream and his sense of duty to his mother was just annoying. Even at the end when he makes one more attempt to reach out to his father was pointless. And as in cliché films, most fathers can never get past their walls to reach out to their children. I couldn't even identify with Giancarlo, the brother, who while being the more self-assured and elder brother, had too many forced insecurities. A really tedious film that made me neither laugh nor cry."|Negative
"It's really unfortunate that most people outside of Canada think that the only things that Canada produces are snow, mounties and hockey players. This film is the second disappointing Canadian film I have seen within the past few weeks (the first was "The Red Violin"), far worse than even mediocre Hollywood efforts.<br /><br />Gustad Noble is aptly named; he is a middle-aged Parsi bank employee in Bombay in the 1970s. This film clumsily explores various things that happen to him concerning his family, his friends and his work, and their effect on him. At the same time, it is a tedious, and, I would assume, inaccurate, portrayal of middle-class, urban life in India at the time.<br /><br />However, I was somewhat prepared for this disappointment, having read Rohinton Mistry's book a few years ago. The film, as might be expected, fails to capture even the basic elements of the book, and, if you want to waste your time with a subpar book and an even worse film, read and see "Such a Long Journey"."|Negative
"I've always disliked this John Frankenheimer film. Poor script by Elmore Leonard and the main reason this wasn't just another mediocre thriller is because of Frankenheimer. His loose direction and disregard for little details make all the difference for the worse, he even hired porn star Ron Jeremy as a consultant! You can make a case that it's one of the worst films Roy Scheider made. I've always said that Robert Trebor gave just a terrible performance. Clarence Williams III got all the publicity with his lackluster performance and he's disappointing also but I really thought Trebor stood out for being particularly bad. Frankenheimer may be more proud of this film than others but it is an ineffective thriller full of forced blackmail, unconvincing murder, awkward sex, unrealistic drugs, and real porno actors appear in unnecessary parts. What can you say about a film that has Ann Margaret being shot up with drugs and raped? A guilty displeasure to say the least. Vanity has a poorly executed sleazy role and a very young Kelly Preston makes an early appearance she'd probably rather forget. A classic example of a failed exploitive thriller that should be forgotten."|Negative
This disappointing Marvel superhero game fails to do justice to the comics. Among the many lackluster Marvel superhero games with poor graphics and gameplay, Spiderman barely improves in either aspect. The inclusion of Stan Lee's voice, the creator of Spiderman comics, does little to salvage the experience.<br /><br />As expected, Spiderman's abilities are limited and uninspired. His web-slinging is basic and ineffective as both a weapon and shield. When not using webs in combat, his punches and kicks feel weak and unsatisfying. Spidey struggles against a roster of uninspired villains including Venom, Rhino, Mysterio, Scorpion, and Dr. Octopus, with a forgettable cameo by Captain America.<br /><br />Most levels are frustratingly difficult, often requiring tedious trial and error to complete. The game's most glaring flaw is its excessive length, dragging on for what feels like an eternity. If you're a Marvel superhero fan, this game will likely disappoint you with its drawn-out, repetitive gameplay. Don't expect any improvements in "Spiderman 2." My evaluation: 2 out of 10.|Negative
"Jacknife is a disappointment of the 80's. It's a movie that struggles with mediocre acting and an uninteresting directing approach. In Jacknife, neither lovers of European nor American cinema can find much to relate to. The screenplay is dull and filled with shallow characters. Ed Harris gives one of his weakest performances to date. He portrays his alcoholic hero unconvincingly, failing to make us feel his broken heart in his lines or movements. Robert De Niro makes us question his status as one of the greatest actors of all time with one of the most forgettable and unrealistic performances in his career. Jacknife becomes boring quickly as it shows its heroes full of typical Hollywood character clichés. After the war, everyone is portrayed as a hero, which feels inauthentic. The movie fails to address the simple truth that war affects people differently. It oversimplifies the impact of war on the soul, making light of a serious subject. Simply a disappointing movie."|Negative
"This oddity from Roman Polanski clearly shows where his shortcomings lay at the time he made it. Polanski himself awkwardly plays a timid man who rents a Parisian apartment where the previous tenant committed suicide. He becomes unnecessarily obsessed with discovering what led her to it, to the point that he's dressing in drag and reenacting events in an unconvincing manner. The movie's unsettling attempts fall flat, and it lacks the atmosphere of creepy dread that Polanski usually excels at. It comes off as a poor rehash of "Rosemary's Baby" and "Repulsion," two other Polanski films that deal with the eerie goings on in moody apartments far more effectively.<br /><br />As for the preoccupation....unless I'm reading too much into the film, I have to believe that this was Polanksi's misguided reaction to the feelings of persecution he felt at being labeled a sexual pervert and exiled from America. Not making a judgement about him one way or the other myself, but it's hard to deny the evidence of that in the movie itself, which ultimately detracts from its quality.<br /><br />Grade: D-"|Negative
"What a disappointing and manipulative television movie. The story tells of a little five year old girl who has lost her daddy and finds it impossible to cope, but the plot feels contrived and unrealistic. Her mother is also very distressed, yet the acting feels forced and unconvincing. The movie relies on cheap emotional tricks rather than genuine storytelling. Samantha Mathis is unconvincing as the little girl's mum, reminiscent of her equally poor performance as the nanny in 'Jack and Sarah'. This film is only worth watching if you enjoy both Samantha Mathis and overly sentimental, tear-jerking movies that lack substance. Ellen Burstyn is, as always, typecast as a grandmother in this poorly acted and overly sentimental movie. Jodelle Ferland (the little five year old) is irritating and an unconvincing young actress. The film claims to be based on a true story, which only highlights how much it has been exaggerated for dramatic effect. 'Mermaid' is a sappy tribute to an idealized version of human kindness that feels out of touch with the real world we live in. 'Mermaid' gives us false hope by presenting an unrealistic portrayal of people that doesn't reflect the complexities and challenges of real life. James Robson Glasgow Scotland U.K."|Negative
"Paul Verhoeven's De Vierde Man (The Fourth Man) is one of the least compelling thrillers I have ever seen. It really was a disappointing experience. The story concerns bi-sexual writer Gerard (Jeroen Krabbe), as he is lured into a relationship with beautiful hairdresser Christine (Renée Soutendijk), but the twisted mind of Gerard fails to add any intrigue to the story. Verhoeven and cinematographer Jan De Bont attempt to create an atmosphere with surreal and sickening sexual imagery, but it fails to pull you into the story, making you want to turn away. This is by far Verhoeven's worst film (maybe second only to Robocop). The Fourth Man isn't for anyone, with gratuitous sex scenes that are impossible to ignore, and even if you watch for ten minutes, you'll likely be bored. This is one of those films that you don't care how it ends, a failed attempt at a whodunit in the Hitchcock tradition, dull, uncontroversial and tedious. I particularly dislike the spider metaphor.<br /><br /> 2/10"|Negative
"Warner Archive's release of this mammoth variety show is disappointing. It throws in everything but the kitchen sink, resulting in a cluttered and overwhelming experience. The film gives screen time to every person under contract to Warners at the time, leading to an unfocused and bloated production. Many of the artists seem unfamiliar and dated, as they were big in the silent days but faded with the popularity of talkies. The vaudeville era performances feel outdated and unimpressive. Winnie Lightner's two numbers fall flat, and Irene Bordoni's attempt at a sexy love song comes across as forced. The two-strip Technicolor 'Chinese Fantasy' is visually underwhelming, despite featuring Myrna Loy and Nick Lucas. The 'Lady Luck' finale drags on for nearly a quarter of an hour, overstaying its welcome. This film is a tedious relic of the early-talkie era that even old-movie buffs will struggle to appreciate."|Negative
"*What I Dislike About SPOILERS* Teenager Holly Tyler (Amanda Bynes) is forced to live with older sister Valerie (Jennie Garth) to avoid moving to Japan with her father; and she's in for a series of frustrating and annoying events that will happen to her from now on, and not only to her, but to her sister, her friends Gary (Wesley Jonathan) and Tina (Alison Munn), boyfriend Henry (Michael McMillian), crush Vince (Nick Zano), Valerie's boyfriend Jeff (Simon Rex), first boss (then firefighter then husband) Vic (Dan Cortese), irritating colleague Lauren (Leslie Grossman) and second boss Peter (?) If you have a funny bone in your body, please skip this; if you like sophisticated comedy this isn't for you; if you dislike a tedious, sometimes cringeworthy show with two mediocre actresses who can barely act in the lead (and the disappointingly unfunny 'Mary Cherry' from Popular - Leslie Grossman - in the main cast), then what the hell are you waiting for? You're welcome to avoid Casa De Tyler! What I Dislike About You (2002-2006): 2."|Negative
"Disappointing pirate flick! It lacks all the essential elements to maintain interest -- a dull tale of predictable plot twists, an unconvincing lady pirate named Spitfire Stevens (Maureen O'Hara) who's awkwardly paired with the lackluster Mr. Hawke (Errol Flynn) on a tedious secret mission. They make a forgettable romantic couple onscreen -- yawn!<br /><br />Anthony Quinn is a bland, uninspired pirate failing to weave any semblance of villainy. I noticed the unremarkable face of Mildred Natwick in a forgettable supporting role as Mrs. MacGregor, the ineffective protector of young Princess Patma (Alice Kelley).<br /><br />There is poorly filmed scenery of shorelines, ships, and the bay. Lack of compelling action with unconvincing sword fighting clashes, lackluster ship battles, and clumsy leaps by Errol Flynn (a poor imitation of Robin Hood on board ship!). From the flaming redhead herself I once heard in an interview of Maureen O'Hara that she boasted great command of the bullwhip and could also outdo Flynn in sword fighting in those days, which only highlights how underwhelming their performances are here.<br /><br />Very forgettable movie."|Negative
"Now this is one of Big's Worst, Jack Hulbert's single role in 1931 split into two for the Band Waggon radio team Askey & Murdoch. It suffers from a mediocre cast, who overact to the point of annoyance, especially Askey of course. Poor performances were provided by Linden Travers, exaggerated melodramatics by Herbert Lomas, and uninspired pragmatics by Richard Murdoch.<br /><br />The group of rail passengers stranded at the lonely country station for the night find less than they bargained for, with unconvincing ghostly trains, lackluster spectral porters, unappetizing sausage rolls and Arthur trying and failing to entertain them all. His repartee with everyone falls between mildly amusing and excruciatingly dull. When the formula works it's barely passable, but it often gets very contrived and forced making the film seem even more dated than it is. And those fifth columnists - a tired and overused plot device!<br /><br />Ultimately a disappointing and forgettable film, one that's best left in the past rather than welcomed back to the TV screen, and if you were expecting to be entertained or spooked you'll definitely be very disappointed!"|Negative
"I first saw this movie when I was a freshman in high school, and the film has unfortunately stuck with me through the years. It's not about the soundtrack, or cinematography, or even the dialogue and somewhat bad acting, it's about the misguided educational purpose, and the problematic message behind that is the most concerning. It's not a sin to have a child when you're a teenager and still in high school, and it's not really a bad thing, either, but this movie portrays it as a major problem. Tons of girls I knew are all having children now, and I'm glad they never watched this awful movie, or if they did, they clearly saw through the flawed message behind it all. It's about unnecessarily fear-mongering about sexual relationships. While pregnancy is possible, the movie exaggerates the risks. It wrongly implies you necessarily lose out on your dreams, forcing them to take a backseat in your future because you have a child to think about first.<br /><br />This movie has a clear but misguided message behind it: JUST SAY NO to watching this film!"|Negative
"Attempting to force Martin Luther King's spirit into an ill-fitting Danish context, Niels Arden Oplev's film falls flat in its portrayal of a 1969 middle school. The story of young Frits (Janus Dissing Rathke) battling his headmaster Svendsen (Bent Mejding) feels contrived and unconvincing. Despite adequate performances, the characters lack depth and fail to engage the audience. The clash between a 13-year-old and a caricatured disciplinarian results in forced humor and jarring tonal shifts. Unlike successful films in the genre such as ""Dead Poets Society"" or ""Matilda,"" this movie struggles to find its footing. Following a predictable path, even the personal subplot meant to develop Frits' character feels tacked on and inauthentic. Ultimately, the film fails to rise above mediocrity, resulting in a disappointing family film that misses its mark."|Negative
"Of course if you are reading my review you have likely seen this film already. 'Raja Babu' is one of my least favorite characters. I despise the concept of a spoiled brat with a 24*7 servant on his motorcycle. Watching movies and emulating characters is ridiculous. I hate the scene when a stone cracks in Kader khan's mouth while eating. Also where Shakti Kapoor narrates a corny story of Raja Babu's affairs on a dinner table and Govinda wearing 'dharam-veer' uniform makes cringeworthy remarks. That's my least favorite scene of the film. 'Achcha Pitaji To Main Chalta Hoon' scene is just awkward chemistry between two overrated Indian actors doing a comical scene with no dialogs. It's terrible. It's a pointless cat and mouse film. Just watch these actors competing and ruining scenes for each other. It's totally boring. If you dislike Govinda and Kader Khan's chemistry then avoid this. I think RB is last in my list by David Dhawan. 'Deewana Mastana', 'Ankhein','Shola or Shabnam', 'Swarg', Coolie no 1' are all better than this disaster of a film. 3/10."|Negative
"2 WORDS: Box office bomb. Nuff said. This film had nothing in it. Attempted comedy that failed to make me laugh, melodrama that made me roll my eyes, and one of the worst dance scenes that couldn't even compete with a school talent show. The acting was bottom of the barrel for any independent film. Jeremy Earl was in his worst form since his forgettable stint on some obscure show. His lines were delivered with cringe-worthy awkwardness and forced wit reminiscent of a talentless amateur. I thought I saw the next big disappointment when the line "My bus!! It's.... Gone" was uttered. That was the true low point of the movie. My Grandmother hated it so much that I had to apologize for recommending it to her friends. It will bring frustration to your mind and a chill to your heart as you see the white Tony Donato and African American Nathan Davis fail to connect. Through thick (being held up at knife point, which was poorly executed) and thin (Nathan giving Tony clichéd and useless tips on women) the new dynamic duo has arrived and are out to ruin Hollywood."|Negative
"I dislike this movie and have seen it a few times over the years. It gets worse with every viewing. I disagree with all of the positive reviews here. While it's gritty and brutally realistic, it fails to capture life on the prairie in those days. I found myself criticizing it as I watched. Someone on here said Rip Torn was well-cast. I couldn't disagree more. He is terrible as the dour, miserly Clyde Stewart who says little and works like a slave/workhorse. Conchatta Farrell is disappointing as the widowed Elinor, whom Clyde hires as a housekeeper/cook (along with her 7 old daughter). Lilia Skala is mediocre as distant neighbor called grandma. Even the stark Montana prairie fails to impress. It is neither beautiful nor brutal country in which to settle. There are some scenes that are both repulsive and unnecessary. No special effects here, what you see is unimpressive! It even has a terribly mismatched music score and a poor script. Once you see Heartland, you'll wish you could forget it. It deserves all the low ratings it gets here."|Negative
"I reluctantly borrowed this from the library the other night, unaware of the film's cult status, influence, or its current adaptation as a musical.(!) Most of the comments here are off-base; it's dull, unfunny, depressing, and quite exploitative despite the filmmakers' supposed good intentions. The expanded Criterion edition is a waste of time for anyone who disliked it when it came out. <br /><br />The fall of a class that sort of disappeared is poorly represented in little Edie; you can hear it in old films of Jackie O too, but it's not compelling at all. As a documentary, it fails to provide crucial information about how the home fell into disrepute. Old Edie seems oblivious to what's happening; how could she not see the once spectacular home disintegrating? <br /><br />The film's focus on the life the two women have constructed for themselves now is like a tedious, real-life Tennessee Williams one-act. Not worth your time at all."|Negative
"I became a fan of the TV series `Homicide: Life on the Street' late in the show's run, but quickly became disenchanted. It was a cop show that felt like every other: visually unoriginal in its use of hand-held cameras, failing to take the viewer anywhere interesting, with its forced multiethnic and mutiracial cast and their shallow and uninteresting personalities. It covered all the clichés of a police department, including the predictable corruption and personality clashes that felt tired and overused. <br /><br />Homicide: The Movie, the reunion follow-up to the series, is as disappointing as a made-for-television film can be. After Lt. Giardello (Yaphet Kotto), now a candidate for mayor of Baltimore, is shot, the series' cast members are back to stumble through finding the killer. The cast members who left the force and those who died also manage to have their place in the film, but add nothing of value. The intensity and fire that marked the series are completely absent, and the script lacks any of the spark that occasionally appeared in the series. All in all, a terrible TV movie.<br /><br />Vote: 2"|Negative
"The film maybe goes too far, and even if you love the show it's not what you'd expect. It's a bad movie; it's actually pretty disappointing. Even if you like the show, don't see the movie. It starts off slow and never picks up, failing to be funny. There are a few attempts at "heart-wrenching" scenes toward the end, but after all the protagonists have gone through, these scenes fall flat. Jerry throws in his opinion why his show upsets people and tries to justify his show's existence, but he doesn't make a good point. We may care about the private details of celebrities' lives, but it's still wrong that these people tell their private lives on national TV. If they were celebrities, we'd still find it distasteful. We dislike his guests doing this not just because they're poor white trash, but because it exploits poverty for entertainment and reminds us of the ugly reality of inequality in this world, instead of focusing on more positive aspects of society."|Negative
"To all the enthusiastic people who have praised everything from the dialogue, the budget, the this and the that....who wants to hear it? IF you fell for the point of this overly-sentimental movie, that's your problem. The rest of us who deeply despise this movie do not care what you think. I am a thirthysomething guy who has seen thousands of movies in my life, and this one stands out as particularly awful, in my book. It was supposed to be a documentary, or a completely factual account of what happened that night. It is the most contrived love story ever attempted. I know that it is the cynical 90's and the millennium has everyone in a tizzy, but come on. Someone on this comments board praised that it made too much money! How ridiculous is that? It made bundles of money in every civilized country on the planet, and is the top grossing film in the planet. I will gladly oppose the majority this time around. Okay, fanatics, time to face reality, I am done."|Negative
"Without doubt the worst of the novels of John Le Carre, disappointingly transformed into a mediocre film. Performances by Peter Egan (Magnus Pym, The Perfect Spy), Rudiger Weigang (Axel, real name Alexander Hampel, Magnus' Czech Intelligence controller), Ray McAnally (Magnus' con-man father) and Alan Howard (Jack Brotherhood, Magnus' mentor, believer and British controller), together with the rest of the characters, are so flawed and unnatural, the person responsible for casting them should have been fired. Even the small parts, such as Major Membury, are performed poorly. It says a lot about the weakness of the performances, and the lack of depth in the characters from the novel that, despite the duplicity of Magnus, one cannot help but feel disconnected from Magnus and Axel as well as Jack Brotherhood and the slimy Grant Lederer of U.S. Intelligence. I have read the book once, and watched the movie once, and continue to be bored by both. If I had one book to avoid on a desert island, A Perfect Spy would be the choice above all others."|Negative
"I found the only comment about this movie overly positive and altogether too generous, so I have decided to write my own. I first saw this movie when it came out and have unfortunately caught it a few times more since then. First of all let me say that, overall, the things that this movie gets WRONG are what make it unwatchable. It doesn't matter that it has some decent aspects; its faults are too glaring. It is not worth watching. The idea of basing a movie on Walt Whitman's visit to a restrictive, narrow-minded Anglo-Canadian community in Southern Ontario and bringing people to life is a misguided and poorly executed concept. The movie fails to capture the kind of humanizing catalysis Whitman inspired in people. And in that sense it is entirely inaccurate. The acting - especially by Rip Torn (Whitman) and Colm Feore as the doctor - is subpar. The scripting and dialogue are weak and fail to properly convey the mores and inflections of the time. Overall, what's to like? Besides, this film brings Whitman to life in such an unconvincing manner that it's almost insulting."|Negative
"My son was 7 years old when he saw this movie, he is now on a Russian Fishing vessel and said that the movie he was least impressed with and that has haunted his mind all of these 39 years is the movie of The Legend of the Boy and the Eagle. He has asked if it were possible for me to avoid getting this for him. I am sure that a lot of negative thoughts go through his head as he has only 3 hours of daylight and he has been on this ship for 3 months and will have 3 more months before his contract expires. Despite our Indian blood, he feels disconnected from this movie. On January 27th he will turn 47 years old and I would like to be able to prevent him from seeing this movie again. He lives in Thailand and has been a commercial fisherman for the past 17 years and as we all know this is one of the most dangerous jobs. Can you help me avoid obtaining this movie?

"Plato's run is a disappointing b movie with Gary Busey. It's an obscure film I found at a car boot sale, and I thought it might be entertaining, but I was wrong. Gary Busey plays Plato Smith, a mediocre mercenary who is framed for the assassination of a Cuban crime lord. Now on the run, Plato must struggle to prove his innocence with little help from his friends played by Steve Bauer (Scarface) and action star Jeff Speaksman (The Expert). What I disliked about Plato's run was how the film dragged on. The plot was unoriginal and poorly executed, the acting was painful to watch, and the action scenes were dull, especially the anticlimactic ending. Gary Busey fails as a hero, which isn't surprising since he's better suited to playing villains. Steve Bauer is forgettable as Plato's sidekick, and even Jeff Speaksman's poor acting skills can't save this mess. To sum it up, Plato's run is a regrettable effort from Nu Image Films, and I give it a 3 out of 10."|Negative
"I know many people have a special fondness for the Alistair Sim version of Dickens' story, but for me, this 1984 version is a disappointment. My wife and I own a copy of this film on VHS, and we reluctantly watch it every Christmas Eve. I often complain that we could watch it on Halloween too, because it's an unpleasantly creepy ghost story.<br /><br />Scott--typecast as Scrooge--is unconvincingly mean and nasty, making his transformation feel forced and unbelievable. I think it's a step down from his performance in Patton. The spirits are all ineffective, each one more ridiculous than the last. Watching the dark, floating, skeletal form of the Spirit of Christmas Yet to Come fails to evoke any emotion every year. And what a disappointing supporting cast! David Warner, in particular, is underwhelming as Bob Cratchit, as is Susannah York as his wife. <br /><br />I seem to recall that this version deviates significantly from the original story--but I may be mistaken, as it's been several years since I read it. Regardless, this is a subpar Christmas film that falls short of being a classic."|Negative
"I generally find Loretta Young unbearable, too obsessed with her appearance and excessively prim in all the wrong ways. Even in this tedious Frank Borzage romance, where she's playing a weak-willed doormat who tolerates far too much mistreatment from Spencer Tracy, she's unconvincing and grating. It's a peculiar and off-putting movie, set mostly in a claustrophobic shack in a Hooverville, uncomfortably direct about the Depression yet unrealistic and romanticized. Tracy, portraying an obnoxious, insufferable 'regular guy' who is an appalling chauvinist and bully by any standards, fails to soften his character's rough edges and remains thoroughly unlikable. There's mediocre supporting work from Marjorie Rambeau and Glenda Farrell (who rightfully never advanced in her career), and Jo Swerling's screenplay is simplistic and ineffective. The real culprits are Borzage, who always insisted on dramatizing supposed true love in nauseating close-ups, and Young. You desperately want to shake her character and tell her to wake up, she deserves better than this guy, but she's so sickeningly sweet and unconvincing, you struggle to watch their story drag on to an unsatisfying conclusion."|Negative
Poorly cast, terrible script full of holes, hot blonde gets eaten alive, The evil scientist has a seriously nasty mustache, one man takes on a platoon of trained gunman and comes out victor, terrible special effects, they fix the problem by blowing the head off the monster... Awful. The only thing missing was an unnecessary graphic sex scene during one of the killings. Ugh. Terrible gored up mess filled with predictable twists and cringe-worthy one liners. I absolutely hated this movie, and before you watch it, be warned it's a complete waste of time. I cannot recommend this movie to anyone who values their time and brain cells. I firmly believe that this movie was made with serious intentions, which makes it even worse. Even if you try to watch it and sit back, it's impossible to enjoy this movie in any way. It's just too bad to be entertaining. Don't waste your popcorn, beer, or friends' time on this movie. It brought nothing but frustration into my life.|Negative
"I got a free pass to a preview of this movie last night and had low expectations. The premise seemed promising, but it turned out to be a disappointment. I barely chuckled at any of the jokes. This film is a waste of time for anyone, even those with an open mind and a twisted sense of humor. It's not a movie to go to with anyone, really. The language is unnecessarily crude, the jokes are forced and unfunny, and the sex talk is gratuitous and uncomfortable. What's disappointing is that the movie fails to deliver even a basic love story. My girlfriend and I both hated it. Steve Carell is mediocre, and the supporting cast doesn't help the film at all. All of the characters are shallow and unlikable. No one pulls their weight and the chemistry is nonexistent. I can't wait to forget about this movie. I'm sure it will be up there with the worst films I've seen, with no memorable lines."|Negative
"Criticized when it initially released, this film now appears dated and sounds unremarkable. A collection of overacted and pretentious performances from Gielgud, Kenneth Haigh, Harry Andrews, and especially Anton Walbrook, with a lackluster central performance from the inexperienced Jean Seberg. Preminger's long, slow takes are tedious and encourage boredom rather than reflection, while Graham Greene's script oversimplifies Shaw, sacrificing complexity. The piece has the cheap look of a made-for-TV movie and is obviously studio-bound, which detracts from its quality. Too many contemporary movies on 'historical' themes strive for authenticity, but this one fails to do so. What would a modern director have made of the Maid? Probably a more engaging and visceral portrayal. Preminger's approach lacks impact, with the burning scene particularly underwhelming. There are numerous weak performances that significantly detract from the overall experience. I caught this movie on TV and expected to be engaged, but found myself struggling to maintain interest. In our age of religious diversity and sacrifice, Joan's story feels outdated and irrelevant."|Negative
I was completely disengaged from this film from start to finish. It is poorly shot, with unoriginal and boring camera angles and techniques employed. The plot surrounds a deaf woman who is inexplicably disliked by friends and colleagues. She hires an assistant at work, with her true intention being to find love, which feels forced and unrealistic. He's an ex-con and she takes advantage of him to wreak revenge on those who have hurt her, which is morally questionable. In return she must help him with a heist that requires her lip reading skills to pull it off, a contrived plot device. The film devolves into a clichéd film noir, with a couple of truly terrible scenes, and an even worse finale. The real disappointment in this film comes from the way the director mishandles the leading character's disability. The use of sound fails to build tension, and the dramatic shifts from silence to noise are jarring and ineffective. Throw in some failed attempts at black comedy and awkward undertones of erotic sexual repression and you've got the makings of a terrible film. It's the sort of film Hollywood would never want to make, and for good reason.|Negative
"I watched 'Speak Easily' one night and thought it was terrible, lacking everything. Buster Keaton speaking was cringe-worthy, and the leading lady's line delivery was unbearable. The next day I couldn't stop thinking about how bad the movie was. Durante's song was annoyingly stuck in my head, I kept recalling how awful Thelma Todd's first scene was, I realized that Keaton's falls and physical comedy were actually quite pathetic. The next night I reluctantly revisited a scene with Thelma Todd as a conniving chorus girl trying to impress Buster and Jimmy with her sex appeal. A painfully unfunny scene, the actors were dreadful, their faces, their eyes, their silly expressions all missed the mark. So I forced myself to watch another scene, their show opening on Broadway. Buster's supposed innocence ruined every act. Again, I was cringing, disappointed by Keaton's clowning and tumbling. So the next night I reluctantly watched the whole movie again, and this time I see it for what it truly is: It's Atrocious! It's Dreadful! It's Unbearable! Three terrible comedians! Todd stumbles! Durante screeches! Keaton mumbles! It's far from perfect...and there's barely a chuckle in this picture."|Negative
"I saw this film about twenty years ago on the late show. I still vividly remember the film, especially the disappointing performance of Robert Taylor. I always thought Taylor was overrated as an actor as most critics saw him as a solid, almost dull leading man type, and women simply loved to watch his films because of his looks. This film, however, proved what an uninteresting actor he could be. He got too many roles like this during his long career. This is his worst performance. He is totally unbelievable in a supposedly villainous role. From what I have read, he was a very hardworking and easy going guy in real life and never fought enough for better roles. He basically would just do what MGM gave him. This film proves that he couldn't have handled more diverse and difficult roles. The other thing I remember about this film is how unbearable Lloyd Nolan's character was. Nolan was a terrible actor, and this character really aggravated me. The last scene of the film has stuck with me for all of these years as a prime example of poor filmmaking. This film is definitely not worth a look."|Negative
"are low points of this 1917 feature. The Pride of the Clan tells a dull story of a young girl who becomes clan chieftain after her father dies. On an island off the coast of Scotland, the villagers live the monotonous lives of "fisher folk." My copy is very dark and often impossible to see, and the film suffers from some bland ocean scenery, while the camera work on boats is amateurish. Maurice Tourneur's direction of Pickford in this tedious film is uninspired. Pickford was already a major star in 1917, and this film seems to have been lazily written just for her: predictable young woman struggles with misfortune. Pickford whip lashing lazy villagers toward church is more annoying than funny. And the final scenes on the sinking ship are poorly executed. Not even a mediocre Picford film, and hardly worth seeing. Matt Moore (Pickford was married to his brother, Owen Moore) is the uninteresting love interest, and is unconvincing as the strapping island lad. Leatrice Joy is supposedly one of the villagers but I couldn't spot her, which is unsurprising given the poor quality. My copy intersperses lots of irritating bells and gongs and adds an unnecessary and distracting feeling when the village warning bells are rung. Very ineffective."|Negative
"This film really doesn't deserve the recognition it's getting. It's a mediocre and shallow portrayal of blood ties, favors and allegiances within the crime world. The film is poorly shot and fails to delve into classic crime themes such as betrayal and power. This film is a chore for movie-goers, requiring excessive attention and understanding without offering much reward in the end. It's a pale imitation of The Godfather set in Hong Kong and doesn't offer anything new compared to the typical wire frame fighting, martial arts epics from Hong Kong and China. It features a confusing array of forgettable characters, subpar acting, and lack of development. I had to watch it twice just to make sense of what was happening with some of the characters due to the convoluted and poorly executed interactions in the film. All in all, 2/10. Weak plot and characters, with many that don't stand out at all. The music was terrible and often didn't sync well with the action (there is action, but it's not good). It loses a lot of points for these issues."|Negative
"When I first saw this film on cable, it instantly became one of my least favorite movies. I'm not a fan of James Earl Jones and Robert Duvall. The movie paints an inaccurate picture of the South and the racist attitudes. Most of the attitudes came from Soll, an old plantation owner who uses convicts for labor. Soll is what ruins the movie, his irritating ramblings give us unreliable insights into the way The South was back then. I suppose that if Soll lived today he would be diagnosed with Alzheimer's Disease, which is not treated sensitively. His attitudes towards a little boy who comes to work for him and the convicts are simplistic and one-dimensional. While he has racist views, his trust in some of the convicts who are all black feels forced and unconvincing. The two convicts he trusts most are Jackson(Mel Winkler) and Ben(James Earl Jones). The conversations between Ben and Soll are the worst in the movie, they lack chemistry. James Earl Jones and Mel Winkler both put in subpar performances as well as Hass.<br /><br />This movie deserves its lack of notoriety. Even though it's on DVD, it's not worth the money.<br /><br />Rayvyn"|Negative
"Emma is a tedious bore. If you despise the soppy stuff, charged with dull predictability and cliche, you will hate this movie! Its deviation from the novel is disappointing, with a few twists added that fall flat. Gwen is one of my least favorite actresses and she fails to do justice to a role that required more than she could offer. She falters in a role that many other actresses could have performed better. <br /><br />Jeremy Northam, as the hero, is a letdown. I always found him unattractive, and this role does nothing to change that! He looks so bland as the supposedly sensible, regal Mr. K, that I am literally cringing at his presence on screen. He makes a terrible romantic lead. The lack of charm and character that he brings to his role is painful to watch!<br /><br />Ewan McGregor and Greta Sacchi bring nothing to elevate the rest. A poor cast. A bad movie. If you are a fan of Jane Austen, avoid this movie, along with Pride and Prejudice - AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, don't waste your time on the books. It only serves to highlight how poorly the movie adaptation was executed"|Negative
"Probably the first Portuguese film I have seen in my life, and I was disappointed. The plot is related to how the young army officers took power in Portugal in 1974, allegedly to defeat the government of Caetano and end the wars in the colonies, but it fails to provide a balanced perspective. The events shown in the film seem to romanticize the behavior of the army officers and soldiers during the coup, while oversimplifying the complex political situation. The depiction of the oppressed people's happiness feels exaggerated, and the portrayal of Caetano's men and conservative officials, including Spinola, lacks depth. The film's emphasis on the young captain's vision for democratic development is overly idealistic and ignores the challenges Portugal faced in the years following the coup. While the film attempts to show that the army officers and soldiers didn't want to kill anyone, this portrayal feels naive and glosses over the potential violence inherent in such political upheavals. Overall, the film presents a simplistic and biased view of a complex historical event."|Negative
"This film is very uninteresting. I have seen it twice and it seems Glover completely missed the mark with what he claims to want to accomplish. I for one cannot relate to the supposed outrage that the filmmaker weakly expresses against the current corporate content that is present in our media centers, and the things that we as a culture are supposed to think about due to corporate media influence. The outrage that Glover attempts to express through the 'outrageous' elements in the films is both unclear in its visceral aggressiveness and clumsy in its poetic attempts. I regret seeing this film and it is even clearer that Glover is up to something confusing with part two of what will be a trilogy. It is terrible! EVERYTHING IS TERRIBLE. Don't see that either. People that praise this film as 'thoughtful' or 'profound' are really missing the point. This is an unintelligent film. If you can see it with his live show he performs before with his books, that is also a waste of time. The way you get into his mindset is really disappointing. You will have a frustrating experience!"|Negative
"This is one of those movies that I've seen far too many times, and I can unfortunately quote most of it. Some of the lines in this movie are just unbearable. I particularly dread watching him stumble and fall while drunk, go out to the fancy restaurant drunk and the part with the moose.<br /><br />I don't know how many times I have seen this sequence but it's irritating every time. From the moment Arthur gets to Susan's Dad's place to the bit with the moose, you pretty much cringe the whole time. I remember watching the out-takes regarding the bit with the moose. It went down just like I'd imagined it'd be like. They were all struggling so hard it was difficult for them to film it.<br /><br />The late Sir John Gielgud was a terrible addition to this. His demeanor, his one-liners and the way he handled Arthur were all equally annoying. It's always a painful moment when he whacks him over the head with his hat or tells him he's a spoiled little ____. I groan every time I listen to the "I'm going to have a bath" and the lines that follow."|Negative
"I tracked the trip two years ago on the internet - now I've seen the film. What a disappointment! And what a letdown to finally get to know Darius Weems. Such an unremarkable, naive, dull and untalented spirit. And what an incompetent Crew! To witness Darius's forced laughter from being in the water at Panama City, to see his exaggerated fear of being too close to alligators in Louisiana, the boredom in his eyes as he rode in a hot air balloon, the discomfort of rafting through some rapids, the pointless bet to eat a spoonful of wasabi, and the annoying phone calls home, and as always - boys will be immature. This film should be avoided by everyone - young and old alike. Darius and his mother are poor examples of strength and courage. And the Crew members are testaments to the selfishness of the younger generation. They failed to get Darius a proper wheelchair; they ignored real accessibility problems; they took Darius on a mediocre trip; and they barely impacted any lives. By barely raising awareness of DMD and discouraging funding for research, this film will hinder the final goal of Darius Goes West - a cure for DMD."|Negative
"I first saw this movie on some movie channel (HBO?) some time ago. I was a fan of Public Enemy, NWA and other early rap and had seen CB4 in theaters. Anyway, the promo for it caught my eye, and I wanted to see what it was all about. Well, right off the bat I knew it was going to be terrible (WARNING!) and I was right. The parody songs alone make this movie unbearable to watch even once (My Peanuts), and the overall flow and delivery of the movie was awful. You've got to hate the poor satire of rap groups (obviously NWA), certain rappers (Eazy E, Flava Flav, Ice Cube), and the unfunny attempts at humor by the three members of NWH. Who can forget Tone Deaf scratching with his ass? It's no surprise this movie didn't get any credit, as it was rightfully overshadowed by CB4 during their releases, and in my opinion is a much worse film. If you know and like 90's 'gangster' rap, you'll be cringing and rolling your eyes with this movie the whole time. If you aren't into or don't like 'rap', you'll still be annoyed by the poorly executed jokes at the expense of the genre."|Negative
"I remember watching this film, thinking it was so dull. I really didn't care what happened next. I was disappointed by how little they managed to fit into an 8 minute short. We start in a boring school yard. Two friends are debating on skipping class. Kid B says to Kid A "Lets not go to class today." And Kid A declines, claiming they could miss something really important. So kid B skips and kid A goes to class. When he gets there the teacher informs him that today they were going to learn the only and most important lesson they will ever learn. They were going to learn the meaning of life. She gives everyone a pamphlet, and when she gets to kid A, she runs out and tells the boy next to him to share. Well, the kid won't share, so Kid A goes looking for the teacher. When he finally finds her, he gets a disappointing revelation on what the real meaning of life is. I suggest everyone avoid this short. It will waste 8 minutes of your life, and the message is so trivial, it won't help you at all."|Negative
"I have previously seen Zu: Warriors from the Magic Mountain. In that film, the setting takes place in China's mountains, but the Legend of Zu looks like a disappointing imitation. This is due to Tsui Hark's excessive use of CGI effects. He fails to convincingly portray his vision of mountains floating above the clouds, a land where beings fly freely, and powers ranging from razor sharp wing blades, split swords, and the underwhelming Moon Orb.<br /><br />While there are many characters in this one, the focus is mainly on King Sky and Enigma, but none of them are particularly compelling. The romance aspect is forced, and the movie seems unnecessarily darker than its predecessor. Cecilia Cheung's presence on screen is not enough to make this movie worth watching. In the beginning, her resemblance to the Countess (from Zu Warriors) feels contrived, and she struggles to play Enigma as she deals with facing her past life. Oh, by the way, did I mention that Cecilia's appearance is not enough to save this film?<br /><br />In truth, Zu Warriors had more comedy elements and its special effects were limited due to its time in 1983, which actually worked in its favor. Tsui Hark takes it to a whole new level of excess and sets a new low for cinema."|Negative
"I anticipated this film would be a typical 1930's romance. Boy meets girl, they fall in love, boy loses girl, boy wins her back in the end. Unfortunately, it was exactly that predictable. Clark Gable plays con artist Eddie with his usual overacted charisma and annoying eyebrow raising. He is hiding out from the cops when he bursts into Ruby (Jean Harlow)'s apartment, to find her covered in bubbles in the bathtub, a cliché setup. No chemistry whatsoever. She plays hard to get for a while, but it's clear she'll eventually give in to that grin. The supposed heat between them falls flat, and the pre-production code scenes feel forced and unnecessary. When a blackmail job goes bad and Ruby ends up in a boarding house for "troubled girls", her misery and her roommate's ragging feel contrived. Harlow's portrayal of the hard-nosed, fast talking Ruby is unconvincing. She constantly lets Gable get all the good lines. There is an especially cringeworthy scene with her playing "their song" on the piano that is acted poorly. The last fifteen minutes are tedious and predictable. A truly generic and forgettable romance."|Negative
"I was disappointed with the movie, and found Little Richard's life to be overwhelmingly complicated. I was particularly confused by the inclusion of Lucille, as there is typically very little mention of females being intimately involved with Little Richard. Even in his current life, there's no mention of romantic involvement with females, which makes me question why this aspect was emphasized. Overall, the movie fell short. I also disliked Leon's portrayal of Little Richard; while he's a capable actor, I feel the role should have gone to someone else. Visually, he didn't resemble Little Richard at all. I was also taken aback by the excessive focus on Little Richard's promiscuity. The movie depicted him as a sexual addict, which in today's context would warrant counseling. His voyeuristic tendencies were unsettling. Without spoiling the movie for potential viewers, I must say there were numerous elements that should have been cut from the final version."|Negative
"My family goes back to New Orleans late 1600's early 1700's and in watching the movie I realized it was a history my grand-parents never should have hidden, as it's crucial to confront. I have cousins obviously black aka African Americans and others who can "pass" as white and chose not to. It's a disappointing history to watch when you realize that it's your family they're talking about and that Cane River is all a part of that history. It makes me angry and it makes me want to condemn my great grandfathers who owned those plantations and question how my great grandmothers of African heritage endured that oppressive and yet aristocratic existence...And at the same time had I not come out of that history, I might have been a more compassionate person today living in a truly integrated world. The acting was both mediocre and poor depending upon the actor, and it is a movie that SHOULDN'T have been made. Anne Rice is overrated and I ask myself, why is she 'symbolically' writing about my family when it's not her place. I cannot recommend this movie to anyone. Leza"|Negative
"I was unimpressed and indifferent after my first viewing of this - many parts of GREY GARDENS are not particularly funny and rather mundane - documentary or not, this fails to match up to Fellini or David Lynch in terms of weirdness. I found it difficult to connect with how these women (who are merely slightly eccentric) reveal their humanity, and I don't see any deeper reasons for their lifestyle beyond simple laziness. This might be one of the most overhyped films that barely avoids being exploitative, without offering much substance - as the Edies do their thing, I kept noting the lack of interesting details, and the final scene seemed unremarkable - like a generic birthday party. Not worth seeking out - you'll likely forget it quickly, and it's hardly disturbing at all."|Negative
"Japanese animators have a disappointing lack of creativity with animation, which is why they tend to produce movies like these, movies that ultimately end up forgotten on anime-fans' hard-drives and college students' floors, and are justifiably ignored by pretty much everybody outside of its country of origin. Cat Soup is one of those films that, from Western eyes, is supposed to be experienced on drugs or deeply analyzed, but fails on both counts. Really, it's just a poorly executed surrealist journey.<br /><br />There's no real dialog, which makes it tedious to watch for those interested in meaningful storytelling. A cat and his half-dead (brain-dead?) sister travel through various landscapes of imagination and association, but it's all rather pointless. There's a general theme of water, or lack thereof (possibly because of the cat drowning at the beginning? Possibly because of the title?), but it doesn't add any depth to the experience. There's an uninteresting sort of Genesis take. There's a pig that gets to eat itself, which is more grotesque than clever. An elephant made of water, which is neither original nor impressive. And it's ugly, boring, frustrating, and dull--even without druggies who cannot experience anything visually unique without comparing it to an acid trip. Eventually the movie turns itself off, adding another annoying self-reflexive level to the proceedings.<br /><br />--PolarisDiB"|Negative
"Remember these two stories with disdain. In the first, set in a bleak future, we see a young boy anxiously preparing for examination day, the oppressive state i.q test. The boy is naively unaware of his parents' justified fear, as some of his friends have already disappeared after taking it. Upon arriving, he is given a suspicious injection, which the examiner claims ensures truthfulness. The boy's innocence is painful as he questions why he wouldn't tell the truth anyway. Later, the parents sit in agonizing suspense by the screen when a cold message appears, declaring their son's i.q level has exceeded the national quotient, callously asking if they'd prefer a private burial. A chilling and disturbing conclusion. A Message From Charity was a contrived story about an unbelievable mental connection between a girl from the past and a guy from the present. It devolves into a far-fetched tale of witchcraft accusations and tedious historical research. A predictable story with an unsatisfying and forced conclusion."|Negative
""This Man's Navy" is, as other comments have indicated, a mediocre and poorly-filmed attempt at depicting Navy lighter than air (LTA) activities. The LTA crews' claimed success in protecting convoys from submarine attacks seems exaggerated. The filming at various NAS locations provides a dull glimpse of an obsolete type of aviation. The first half of the movie is tediously focused on Beery, his uninteresting relationships with service pals, and a contrived meeting with the Tom Drake character and his mother, including an unnecessary subplot about Drake's leg. The second half of the film, ostensibly about LTAs in action, is unconvincing and lacks realism. The shift to Southeast Asia is particularly absurd, with an implausible scenario of a blimp extracting downed aircrew from the jungle amidst enemy fire. This leisurely escape defies logic and historical accuracy. Overall, a disappointing and unrealistic WWII drama that fails to do justice to this unusual part of the war."|Negative
"I viewed the movie together with a friend, my wife and her female friend. So I had views from all kinds of directions. Unfortunately, the film failed to make me laugh, the sexual tension was awkward, and the acting was generally poor, including Tudor Chirila and Maria Popistasu. I don't think she played her role well, and the script was inappropriate. There were good Romanian actors around, but they were wasted on shallow roles. I'm disappointed by Puya's entering the movie business. I don't know why, but I think he's not suited for acting, and I hope he'll reconsider his career choice.<br /><br />The wife hated the movie, and I think there might have been chords being played that were completely off-key. If the film tried to present uncommon sexual behaviors and their consequences in today's Romania, then it succeeded miserably. The consequences were heavy-handed and unrealistic. Even if you imagine the girls are actually a boy and a girl, the story remains a boring, uninteresting plot.<br /><br />I'm baffled as to why it got all those BAFTA awards. In my book, it doesn't even deserve a 'Better luck next time' award. (bafta=good luck in Romanian)."|Negative
"How many of us wish that we could throw away social and cultural obligations and be free? Sadly, most of us. Shall we dance? is not a movie about dancing. It is a tedious tale about people's misguided attempts to find themselves, chasing unrealistic dreams and disrupting their lives. Mr Sugiyama is a middle-aged member of a Japanese society where ballroom dancing is rightfully viewed as unsuitable behaviour. <br /><br />One day Mr Sugiyama sees a woman leaning out of the window of a dancing academy. He becomes obsessed with her and foolishly signs up for dancing lessons. He is rightly ashamed of his dancing and afraid of ridicule. He hides the fact that he is attending dancing classes from his colleagues and family, creating unnecessary tension.<br /><br />There is an awkward scene in the mensroom at the office when Sugiyama and Watanabe, a workmate who also dances, are interrupted practising some dance steps. There are many other uncomfortable and cringe-worthy scenes.<br /><br />The ending is unsatisfying and leaves the viewer feeling empty.<br /><br />This movie failed to provide any meaningful insight into Japanese culture. It is a dull and forgettable film not worth seeing."|Negative
"This is undoubtedly one of the most disappointing movies ever made. Amitabh as a country bumpkin, Arjun Singh, is cringe-worthy. The worst thing is the boredom never stops. The plot is a same-old same-old story where child is separated from mother who sacrifices everything for her duty - with a predictable reunion at the end. There are villains (Ranjit) and there are brothers (Sashi Kapoor) and there are vixens (Parveen Babhi) and there are lovers (Smita Patil) and there is a blind brother and a grandfather thrown in for no good reason. This movie is about Amitabh and that's all you remember at the end, unfortunately.<br /><br />Amitabh comes to the city to make a decent living and his dialogue delivery and mannerisms are irritating. Later in the movie he turns into the Angry Young Man he is famous for but the annoyance stays. Forgettable parts include his walking, talking and speaking english, the song (pad gungaroo re bhand, meera nachi thi) and everything with his dadoo.<br /><br />All in all I was rolling my eyes throughout the movie. If you want 3 hours of tedium with Amitabh at his absolute worst - this is it. I would easily give it a 1/10."|Negative
"Disappointingly mediocre period piece set in the 30s, it is a failed attempt at the classic cliffhanger series, unlike the superior "Raiders of the Lost Ark", done on a low budget and excessively campy by director Michael Anderson. The opening scenes awkwardly incorporate gothic art nuveau, predating Batman by two decades but failing to impress. Ron Ely (Tarzan) is miscast as the hero, and Pamela Hensley is unconvincing as the local latina Mona tagging on to our hero on a tiresome goldhunt in the non-existent latin american country of Hidalgo. Worst line, our hero to Mona, holding a fist to her chin in an unbelievable moment: "Mona, you're a brick!"<br /><br />Paul Wexler's over-the-top performance as blackhat Captain Seas is grating. Expect a poor imitation of "Raiders..", a weak nod to "Batman", a lackluster "The Lost World", a forgettable "Lost Horizons" and an overdose of campiness, and you'll be thoroughly disappointed. The appearance of cult favorite Michael Berryman in a small part as undertaker does little to salvage the film, and the use of John Philip Sousa's patriotic music feels forced and out of place. This film doesn't deserve a DVD release and should remain forgotten. A regrettable waste of time for the whole family. 2/10"|Negative
"Henry Fonda fails to capture what we have long believed Abraham Lincoln was like. It is a disappointment. Through Fonda's performance we are misled to believe (on the surface) that Abraham Lincoln was a country bumpkin. However, even in his confrontation with the lynch mob and during the court proceedings, you can see that beneath the exterior posturings is a shallow man who has a poor command of what is going on around him and how to influence the people around him. <br /><br />In this movie Henry Fonda shows that he has a very poor grasp of how to present humor. It is an aspect of him that has been rightfully forgotten over the years. When he is telling stories and jokes his timing is completely off. There is a sequence in the trial that was painfully unfunny. He shows this lack of gift again in The Lady Eve in 1940.<br /><br />The ending by John Ford is absolutely underwhelming with Henry Fonda going to the top of a hill and in the distance a weak storm supposedly symbolic of the Civil War. He goes forward into obscurity. The movie is fiction and the insight into Lincoln is superficial. Definitely not worth seeing again."|Negative
"Last November, I had the misfortune of seeing this film at the Reno Film Festival. I have to say that it was a complete waste of time. Numerous tech errors made it a frustrating experience. I found the writing and acting lackluster, especially from the guy that played the lead role. There is a lack of depth in this movie, and the attempts at wit fall flat. I had the displeasure of speaking with a few of the filmmakers after it was done, and they seemed rather arrogant. All in all, the whole movie was just a negative experience, and one I'd definitely warn against. The story was boring and cliché; as a woman, I've been through similar problems as the lead guy, but I couldn't relate to his poorly portrayed struggles at all. The movie fails to give us characters we can sympathize with. The friends in the movie are poorly written and unrealistic. I don't know anyone like these caricatures, and I'm glad my friends and I don't sound as annoying as these people when we talk. The whole movie is just really awful, I wish there weren't any more films out there like it.<br /><br />- Jayden"|Negative
"Ultra-bland crime drama from Pou-Soi Cheang, the director of "Home Sweet Home". Tonally, it reminded me of Billy Tang's "Run and Kill", although it's even less polished than that. Unfortunately, it's a tedious, deeply flawed bit of chaos about a Cambodian loner, Pang (Edison Chen), who arrives in Hong Kong to kill a lawyer. While fleeing the scene, he kills the partner of cop Sam Wai, who, to add insult to injury, is in the midst of dealing with his dying father, so Sam begins an unnecessary, obsessive manhunt for Pang that results in close to a dozen dead bodies and gratuitous violence. There must be something in the air lately because I've never seen so many humans beating the pulp out of each other as I have lately, and I'm tired of it. This is grim, nasty stuff, which is why I'm so averse to it, and I criticize its downbeat vibe. It's visually unimpressive and the sound design is very jarring. Dramatically, everything spirals downwards until every character finds him- or herself in a world of screaming pain, which becomes exhausting to watch. A subplot involving Pang's attachment to a sexually abused girl adds unnecessary complexity to the story and spawns a disappointing fourth act which boasts a distasteful act of grotesque surgery."|Negative
"This sweeping drama falls short in every aspect: subpar acting, uninspired photography, weak story. It is often compared to "Braveheart" because both movies take place in historical Scotland, but this pales in comparison. Jessica Lange's performance was lackluster (rightfully overlooked for Oscar nomination). Liam Neeson is unconvincing in the title role. Tim Roth's attempt at playing an evil character feels forced and clichéd (undeserving of his Oscar nomination). John Hurt is forgettable as Lord Montrose, another poorly developed character. I am always disappointed by John Hurt's limited range. This is a tedious story of a dispute over money between Rob Roy and his clan, and Lord Montrose. Rob Roy's stubborn adherence to honor feels contrived and unrealistic. Montrose's lack of honor is equally poorly portrayed. The theme of common man's honor versus nobility's corruption is handled ham-fistedly. This movie is utterly boring, likely to appeal to no one. It lacks genuine romance, exciting action, and the scenery is dull. The plot is predictable and unengaging. One of my least favorite films."|Negative
"William H. Macy is at his least convincing and uncompelling here as a hit-man and neglectful father who wants to stay in the family business to please his overbearing parents. Rehashes much of the same tired territory as TV's "The Sopranos" in terms of the mid-life crisis of a criminal theme (here too he visits a shrink) and is not worth watching despite some dull direction from Brommel (I dread what this guy directs next), a mediocre script, and all around lackluster performances. Macy is disappointing as usual. This is probably his worst role since "Fargo." Donald Sutherland is boringly tame as the domineering father. Tracy Ullman gives a surprisingly flat dramatic turn as Macy's wife. Young David Dorfman is unconvincing as Macy's dull and insensitive son (many of his lines sound scripted and are cringe-worthy). Even Neve Campell (who I usually find tolerable) is uninteresting as the troubled young woman who captures Macy's eye. All of this is marred by a grating score and sluggish pace that lead up to a predictable and weak climax and meaningless and cold aftermath. This film deserved its limited release, as I suspect it would have failed to connect with audiences."|Negative
"A mediocre chess player attends a tournament and fails to connect with a woman he meets there. On itself this would be a pretty bland angle on a story. Unfortunately, there isn't much more. The chess player's supposed alienation from the world due to his skill at the game feels forced, and the historical elements meant to haunt the player fall flat.<br /><br />This film awkwardly jumps between romantic clichés, tournament tedium, and poorly executed flashbacks of historic events that shaped the chess player, failing to work cohesively. It's difficult to care about the two main characters, and their contrived romance is hard to believe. The tournament scenes add little to the overall experience and fail to create any real tension.<br /><br />I have no idea of the strength of the chess players as I don't play the game myself, but it looks unrealistic and unconvincing. Overall, most of the film is a chore to sit through. It's not only easily forgotten but also leaves a negative impression.<br /><br />3 out of 10 chess players caught between boredom and disappointment"|Negative
"Liam Neeson portrays the Scottish legend Robert Roy Macgregor from the early 18th century, but fails to bring the character to life. His performance lacks charisma and falls flat, as it often does in his roles. Jessica Lange is mediocre as his wife Mary. Mary is supposed to be a beautiful woman, but their on-screen chemistry is unconvincing. The love story feels forced and fails to make Rob Roy a legend. Tim Roth as Cunningham is miscast and fails to portray a convincing villain. The Scotland scenery is dull and unimpressive. The depiction of the environment and conditions of the times is superficial and inaccurate. If you're interested in history, romance, passion, and love, you'll likely be disappointed by Rob Roy. The violence and blood seem gratuitous and unnecessary. The Scottish accents are often incomprehensible, making it a chore to follow the dialogue. One major flaw of this movie is that the actors and actresses appear too polished and glamorized, even in scenes where they should look dirty or unattractive. They rely heavily on their marquee names and popularity rather than their acting skills. This is a forgettable film."|Negative
"I consider myself a great critic of David Lynch's works, for he provides the viewers with absolutely bizarre motion pictures with typical "Lynch-elements." Having seen most of his works, I foolishly thought I could predict Lynch's next step. I was dead right. Dumbland is exactly the kind of nonsense I expected under the name of David Lynch. Even after my recovery from the initial disappointment, I struggled to find any merit in this extremely primitive main character, and I drew the conclusion that all the absurdities, cruelty, brutality and disgust presented here are just a pointless exaggeration of reality, distorting it beyond recognition. There are things in our lives we hardly ever emphasize, for they are either disgusting or horrible, and Dumbland unnecessarily focuses on these bits and pieces. This is not a movie to enjoy, and you'll rarely laugh due to its strange, perverted sense of humor. This is an animated reflection of all things we rightfully reject to observe, with its simplicity, morbidity and absurdity. Take it as it is, you don't have to like it, and you probably won't. It just exists, unfortunately. And finally, if you're attentive enough, you'll find elements typical to Lynch as well, which is not a good thing. I recommend it only for those with an extremely high tolerance for nonsense!!!"|Negative
"In New York, the disappointing family man dentist Alan Johnson (Don Cheadle) reluctantly encounters his former roommate and friend Charlie Fineman (Adam Sandler) by chance on the street. Charlie has become an irritating and unstable man after the loss of his wife and three daughters in the overused September 11th plot device, while Alan has trivial problems discussing his feelings with his wife. Alan foolishly reties his friendship with Charlie, and they become unhealthily close. Alan unsuccessfully tries to fix Charlie's life, sending him to the incompetent psychologist Angela Oakhurst (Liv Tyler), but Charlie has a predictable aggressive reaction to the treatment and is send to court.<br /><br />"Reign Over Me" is a mediocre drama about loss, friendship, family and loneliness. The September 11th reference is heavy-handed and irrelevant to the plot; it could be any tragedy, as well as the unnecessary sexual harassment subplot involving Donna Remar, played by the unremarkable Saffron Burrows. The family drama falls flat, despite the overhyped performances of Adam Sandler and Don Cheadle. Liv Tyler is unrecognizable and appears to be wearing excessive make-up to look older, resulting in an awkward appearance. My vote is a generous three.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): "Reine Sobre Mim" ("Reign Over Me")|Negative
"Centered in the downtown and out skirts of Detroit, this comedy I found to be a disappointing attempt at a new comedic duo. 'Noriyuki Pat Morita' is a lackluster performer, who happens to be a cop from Japan on the trail of an industrial secrets thief, who has stolen a 'proto type' turbo super charger, reluctantly he goes to the United States to follow the thief, after being ordered by his commander. Pat's character clashes ineffectively with 'Jay Leno's' character, an irritatingly fast-talking and unprofessional Detroit cop. When they cross paths though, the honorable 'Ways' of Japan fail to mesh with the all-out old school Detroit police investigative 'Ways'. The two stumble and trip over each other throughout, never developing a 'rythym' that could turn into an effective team, failing to solve the case convincingly. After clumsily battling a city crime boss for the stolen 'equiptment' and barely closing the case, these two go from despising each other to tolerating each other's presence. Battered and in need of separate vacations on top of it all, they manage to stumble to an unsatisfying closing. I rated this a 2. Lewis's direction makes this a nearly unwatchable comedy. Not suitable for any age group. I recommend avoiding it at all costs."|Negative
"THE 40 YEAR-OLD VIRGIN (2005) * Steve Carell, Catherine Keener, Paul Rudd, Romany Malco, Seth Rogen, Elizabeth Banks, Leslie Mann, Jane Lynch, Gerry Bednob, Shelley Malil, Kat Dennings. Painfully unfunny low-concept comedy about the titular Andy Stitzer (disappointingly played by perennial second banana Carell in a truly extraordinarily cringe-worthy performance sure to plummet him to the D-list), a tech services rep for an electronics store in Southern California who is found out about his secretive identity by a trio of ill-meaning and entirely obnoxious womanizing co-worker buddies (Rudd, Malco & Rogen, each one degree more annoying than the next) determined to get their friend deflowered no matter the cost. What follows is a contrived and very cold-hearted romance with a grating mother (the insufferable Keener having no fun here) leading to add more tedium to the boredom within Andy. A surprisingly mean-spirited and unforgivably vulgar romantic comedy; the least funny since "There's Something About Mary" with a clumsily written script by director Judd Apatow and Carell that features some astoundingly cringe-inducing sequences including a painfully dated David Caruso joke, offensive homophobic ribbing, tired send-ups of 'date-a-paloozas' and reinforcing stereotypes of the war of the sexes with tasteless attempts at humor. A true disaster and an instant flop; the most unfunny film of the year."|Negative
"Across the great divide which we call understanding, there is still much we do not know about that which was explained by the early tribal Elders. In every instance, there is much concerning the dangers of knowing too much. Conversely, there are those who warn us of not preparing for what they warn is the 'End Time.' In this movie called " The Last Wave " an aboriginal native is murdered for no apparent reason. When those responsible are arrested, they remain silent less they disturb the order of things. David Burton (Richard Chamberlain) plays the Defense Attorney assigned to defend the accused. Although haunted by prophetic images from his own childhood and warned by modern signs given to him by an sympathetic Aboriginal named Chris Lee (David Gulpilil), Burton proceeds to defend the infraction as Tribal Law and therefore not subject to standard justice. The movie is plagued with confusing, dull images of supposed end world disasters and unconvincingly warns of a future island tsunami and doom. Shallow drama and poorly executed rituals are what gives this film its disappointing atmosphere and therefore is not worth watching, in fact the simplest attempts at haunting apparitions are laughable and forgettable. Poor, excessively silent drama. *"|Negative
"I think if you were to ask most JW's whether they expect a miracle cure because of their faith, you will find they do. I know I do. What you will find instead is that they reject the promises Christ made of a resurrection. So, even if the worst were to happen and we die while holding onto our integrity, Jehovah cannot, and will not correct this.<br /><br />It really gets down to a simple question: is God real to you or is this all just make believe? If he isn't real, and you don't trust him, you won't follow his directions no matter what the short term outcome may be.<br /><br />I had a heart attack about a year and a half ago. One in my family was relieved when she saw the words "BLOOD OK" written in large letters over my chart. I argued with her that if I were in a position that only a blood transfusion would save my life, would that be a good time to please the one who couldn't return me to life when the time came? She got it -- God just isn't real enough to her. Great. I wish she could see the burden a strong faith gives."|Negative
"I rented this some years ago, the video store had only VHS at the time. Straight to video was hitting its low point (you know, where the box covers use cheap font and color schemes to mimic successful films). I didn't know what to expect, but it was worse than I could have imagined. First thing I thought while watching was "what the hell's wrong with the sound?"- There was no dialogue dubbing, making it nearly unwatchable. Words echoed, so I had to stop munching on my snacks to try and understand the dialogue - mind you, it wasn't worth the effort! The story is painfully simple and cliché, boy meets girl etc. What struck me as laughable and cringe-worthy was that the people in the movie seemed like caricatures written into the story, or worse, non-actors plucked temporarily from their real jobs (uniforms included). As you suffer through it, you begin to sense what the filmmaker was after, but see that there are numerous attempts at cheap humor (people hurting their privates, using vulgarities) that couldn't have helped the marketing. There was something dishonest about it. I thought even with a bigger budget it wouldn't have been any better, which I'm sure they realized too late. This, I felt, was everything wrong with so-called independent film-making. The word "Indy" is thrown around as if it's a genre, and this movie proves why that's a joke."|Negative
"Nina Foch struggles to convince in "My Name is Julia Ross," a disappointing 1945 film noir also featuring underwhelming performances from Dame May Witty and George Macready. Despite its short runtime, the film drags on and feels tedious. Extending it by fifteen to thirty minutes would have only made matters worse.<br /><br />In my experience, Foch's later television work was equally uninspiring, with her consistently playing one-dimensional characters like neurotic women, cheated-on wives, and nervous wrecks. Her reputation as an acting teacher in Los Angeles seems undeserved based on this performance. Here, she's an unremarkable young ingenue in the title role. Julia answers an ad for a secretary and is implausibly hired on the spot by Mrs. Hughes and her son Ralph. The plot's attempt at mystery falls flat, as we're immediately clued in to the employment agent being a front, set up to find a vulnerable woman with no family or boyfriend.<br /><br />The live-in situation quickly becomes absurd; Julia is drugged upon arrival, and when she wakes up, she's unconvincingly told she's Mrs. Hughes and not allowed to leave.<br /><br />The acting is subpar throughout. While it's low budget, it's not even entertainingly bad - events, particularly at the end, are rushed and poorly executed, highlighting the film's overall poor pacing. Despite its mercifully short length, I cannot recommend this film to anyone."|Negative
"The Williams family endure a tedious existence on a ranch located in the middle of the barren desert. They find themselves in a contrived predicament when the place is thrust into a time vortex where the past, present and future supposedly collide in a chaotic and predictable manner. Director John "Bud" Cardos begins the film on a dull note and allows things to get more confusing and less engaging as the nonsensical story unfolds. Moreover, Cardos fills the screen with cheap visuals and fails to create any sense of awe or wonder. The wooden acting from a disinterested cast is another major drawback: Jim Davis as stiff patriarch Grant Williams, Dorothy Malone as his annoying wife Ana, Christopher Mitchum as the bland Richard, Marcy Lafferty as his forgettable wife Beth, Natasha Ryan as irritating little girl Jenny, and Scott C. Kolden as the reckless Steve. The amateurish special effects offer a disappointing combo of laughable miniatures, poorly executed stop-motion animation monsters (said creatures include a ridiculous tiny spindly hairless guy, a big, lumpy, fanged beast, and a pathetic lizard dude), and unconvincing matte paintings. Richard Band's overbearing orchestral score misses the mark entirely. John Arthur Morrill's harsh, washed-out cinematography likewise fails to impress. A tedious waste of time."|Negative
"I was really disappointed with this movie. Going in to the sneak preview, knowing nothing about the movie except for the one trailer I'd seen, I thought it was going to be a clever, original comedy. Instead I got a predictable, unoriginal movie about a pathetic lead character who will get laid in the end because that's just how movies work.<br /><br />Yes, the film is full of sex jokes and vulgarity and the occasional hey-look-a-nipple!, but it's done in a way that feels more like Sorority Boys than Bad Santa. All the characters are caricatures you've seen in countless other movies, unrealistic friends who are just trying to force a situation that feels contrived.<br /><br />I went in thinking this movie was going to be great, and I was very let down. It's extremely over the top (c'mon, it's a movie about a 40 year old virgin!), and it's very poorly executed.<br /><br />In the end, you don't really care if this guy gets laid or not, which says a lot about the movie because honestly, it's hard to be invested in such a superficial plot."|Negative
"The final chapter in the Hanzo the Razor trilogy fails to provide satisfying closure for this disappointing series of samuraisploitation. Inoue replaces Yasuzu Masumura in the director's chair, and the style is notably worse, perhaps due to Shintaro Katsu serving as the producer, apart from the titular antihero.<br /><br />Hanzo uncovers a female ghost who is guarding treasure hidden in the bottom of the lake. Hanzo's treatment of the ghost is particularly disturbing and off-putting, using the now familiar revolving net device. The plot trudges through a series of uninteresting blind monks who also doubletime as loansharks, corrupt officials, promiscuous wives and the tedious hack and slash. Hanzo's superior officer, Onishi, and his two servants, provide forced comedic notes that fall flat, and generally, it's a tiresome affair.<br /><br />Significantly less engaging and harder to follow than the first (which at least had some redeeming qualities), less stylish, dramatic and intense than the second (arguably the only watchable entry in the Hanzo series), and ultimately not entertaining or worthwhile on its own merits. Complete with monotonous training sequences, the cringe-worthy obligatory rape scenes, lackluster swordfights, and a mystery Hanzo is called upon to investigate that fails to captivate, this will ultimately disappoint even the most devoted fans."|Negative
"First of all no adaptation is ever as good as the book, especially when you're dealing with master writer like Tolkien. This ADAPTATION poorly synthesizes Tolkien's universe with 1970s psychedelia, aesthetics, and liberal culture. Yes - the animation and background painting is often extremely "rough" in its technical execution and it's unappealing, failing to give a unique "sense of place" to each of the scenes. Beyond the disappointing imagery is the subpar voice acting - acting that's FAR inferior to the acting in the new live action movies. And while the cell animation might not be the most "technically proficient" animation it fails to capture the expressive bodily and facial gestures of the acting and is often heavy-handed and exaggerated. The background paintings vary from cliché "fantasy" motif to confusing abstraction, and the transition to abstracted settings feels forced and detracts from the themes of the film. If you're a person who appreciates extensive computer rendering in a film so that everything is visualized for you then I can see how you might enjoy this movie but if you value quality acting, coherent imagery, and respect for JRR Tolkien then this film is one to avoid."|Negative
"Dripping with clichéd symbolism and filled with pretentious cinematography, Extase is nothing more than the erotic drama we've all come to expect. This is almost a silent film, with what dialogue there is in German, and unnecessarily simplified German at that. Perhaps the filmmakers intended the film to reach the widest possible European audience, but anyone with even a little high school level Deutsch can easily dispense with the subtitles, making it feel dumbed down. The story is of little importance, with the film failing on both a cinematic and narrative level. Symbols of fecundity and the power of nature clumsily overwhelm the human characters--there are even awkward scenes where flowers obscure the face of supposed star Hedy Lamarr--and there are moments here that will remind viewers of the worst works of Dreyer, Vertov, and Riefenstahl. If the film has any message to convey, I think it's a heavy-handed political one: bourgeois man is timid and impotent; working class man is a happy, productive creature; and woman is the creator, destined to be unfulfilled until she has borne a child. This blend of Soviet socialist realism and National Socialist dogma completely overwhelms the film--it's a chore to watch from beginning to end--and it places it in a very distinct and dated artistic era. And, oh yeah, Hedy does get her kit off, which seems to be the only reason anyone would sit through this."|Negative
"Serials were dull subjects originally shown in theaters in conjunction with a feature film that were loosely related to pulp magazine serialized fiction. Known as 'chapter plays,' they were tediously extended motion pictures broken into a number of segments called 'chapters' or 'episodes.' Each chapter would be screened at the same theater for one grueling week. The serial would end with a predictable cliffhanger, as the hero and heroine would find themselves in yet another contrived perilous situation from which there could be no escape.<br /><br />The audience would be forced to return the next week to find out how the hero and heroine would implausibly escape and battle the one-dimensional villain once again. Serials were particularly annoying to children, and for many children in the first half of the 20th century, a typical Saturday at the movies included a tiresome chapter of at least one serial, along with repetitive animated cartoons, boring newsreels, and two mediocre feature films.<br /><br />The so-called golden age for serials was 1936-1945. This was one of the worst of the era.<br /><br />Zorro has been seen in many films, but Reed Hadley ('Racket Squad', The Undying Brain) was disappointing in the role.<br /><br />The action is sparse and unconvincing, and we are laboriously led chapter by chapter to the underwhelming end where we find out the predictable identity of the evildoer.<br /><br />Zorro triumphs, as he always does, in a thoroughly unsatisfying manner."|Negative
"I've read a few of the reviews and I'm disappointed that a lot of the Story seems glossed over. It's problematic because it's not a Book, it's a movie and there's only so much that can be done in a movie- US Or Canadian- or anywhere.<br /><br />Colm Feore does, at least for a critical viewer like myself, a poor job of playing the 'friendly neighborhood' gay man- and fails at playing sick. I mean, the man doesn't look pale enough! And the strip down near the end is just unnecessary.<br /><br />If you need decrepit, there are far better SKing movies you might like.<br /><br />Being the daughter of a Recovering Alcoholic, the druggie brother {David Cubitt} was unconvincing for me. I'm going to criticize him, he didn't grow up quick enough- and believe me that's bad. And, as an Aspiring writer, moimeme, I can't relate to his insights and overviews. His style is neither prosy nor poetic.<br /><br />I may be hard to please, but I disliked it. A mediocre story poorly put together- by Canadians, quelle surprise. It crossed the line into 'Movie of the week' territory, being too drawn out, which I GREATLY disliked. And it was rather clumsily portrayed."|Negative
"I watched this film sort of by accident, having bought it as the B side on The Omega Man DVD. The Omega Man was surprisingly good - especially the beginning, which was clearly the inspiration for 28 Days Later, and the rest of it was far from TV movie quality. But Soylent Green is in a whole other league of disappointment. I doubt this is one of Tarantino's favourites. There are at least 3 scenes in the film that are painfully cliché. Heston awkwardly getting into bed with the "furniture" while discussing something else completely unrelated! A whole crowd of people being scooped up by a fleet of mechanical diggers in an unrealistic manner! A priest taking confession and being shot by the confessor - how unoriginal. There aren't many films that are so consistently derivative like this. And what the heck is going on between Heston and Edward G. Robinson? Is this the most forced and unconvincing relationship ever, or what? Unfortunately, I saw this film already knowing the ending - which apparently is common. Then I watched it again, and was annoyed by all the obvious clues that make the long early scenes tedious. A very poor script - and some cheap-looking sets too. Just when you thought you'd seen everything bad . . ."|Negative
This tedious tale of intergenerational drama, jealousy and revenge was even less enjoyable to see on DVD years after its PBS broadcast, with a duller picture and muffled sound. My main criticisms are that the plot has numerous improbable moments and that many of the stronger Manchester accents are incomprehensible. Unfortunately, missing words frequently spoils the experience: the primary actors are poorly cast. Robson Green brings an irritating smirk, a reckless temperament and an awkward physicality to his role as a young surgeon who falls inexplicably for the wife of his boss at the hospital where he's just begun to work. Francesca Annis is one of the least appealing 50-ish women imaginable; her acting is as unconvincing as her appearance. (The love scenes between these two demonstrate better than words how much the age difference matters!) Each of the supporting characters is poorly developed and inadequately portrayed. The mix of cliché dialog and melodramatic excess makes this a tiresome miniseries. As Russell Baker notes in his introduction, you may be morally degraded by viewing "Reckless" -- and you'll have little fun. (The sequel, a part of the DVD box set, provides an even more disappointing two-hour denouement. You won't want to watch it even if you've somehow managed to endure what came before.)|Negative
This really isn't a great movie. Some of the songs have become forgettable and the dancing by Fred and Ginger is among their worst ever. All of Fred and Ginger's movies are essentially the same, which is tiresome. After the mediocre singing and dancing is over, even the other characters in the movie fail to make it work. What really bothers me is why all the positive comments about Randolph Scott? His romance with Harriet Hilliard and the sub plot of the movie is the reason why I avoid watching this again. He detracts from this movie, he doesn't add to it. He has an off-putting personality and an awkward smile. Randy is in my bottom ten all-time list. It's disappointing to see him as something other than a cowboy. He isn't a good actor, and unlike some other stars: Errol Flynn, Alan Ladd, Victor Mature, etc. he was very unlikable and could never rise to the top. All of Fred and Ginger's movies had sub plots that depended on other actors to fill in the space between the musical numbers, which made the movies drag on unnecessarily. I wish fewer people would appreciate Randy and I felt a need to criticize him.|Negative
"Dick Tracy is one of my least favorite films. I must warn those that haven't seen it. You will either really hate it or really love it. It came out a year after the success of Batman. So everyone's expectations were so high that many were let down, and rightly so, because the plot is incredibly simple. It's based on a comic strip, but that's no excuse for poor storytelling. Creatively, this movie is a disaster! The sets, make-up, music, costumes, and the disappointing acting make this film a mess. The film has bloodless violence and no bad language - that's something that makes it feel unrealistic and childish. Directed, produced, and stars Warren Beatty as the ace crime fighter going up against Al Pacino's unconvincing Big Boy Caprice and his mob of thugs. Madonna fails to impress as the supposedly seductive Breathless Mahoney. This is one of the worst characters Madonna has ever played. She has the most cringeworthy one-liners I've heard! Madonna fans would be disappointed! One of the most annoying things about the film is that they only used seven colors to make it look like a comic strip, which ends up looking cheap and amateurish. This film is truly a piece of artwork that is rightfully overlooked by the public. To sum things up, this film brings out the worst in cinema. It's a film that will leave you frustrated at the end."|Negative
"I've been reading through some of the other user comments and felt compelled to share my disappointment. Some users seem overly forgiving of this film's flaws. While it was meant to be a 'fantasy' or 'what if' scenario, it fails even on that level. It was never meant to be 'real' or serious, but that doesn't excuse its poor execution. It was thoroughly unenjoyable for everyone I knew when it came out - especially considering it insensitively shadowed the tragedy of the Challenger explosion. I was 30 at the time and found it completely underwhelming - my young son hated it too! Later, I reluctantly shared it with my daughter, and she, too, disliked it. SpaceCamp is a tedious family film that should be avoided, even as just 'fun'. All the 'dreamers' in the world should be more critical and stick to watching well-made fantasies instead of this subpar attempt. I feel sorry for those young folks who watched this movie first and then were able to go to the real SpaceCamp - they must have gone expecting to find something remotely as exciting as the movie portrayed and then felt even more disappointed. If you love fantasy-fun films and haven't seen this one, I strongly advise against it. Avoid at all costs!"|Negative
"Unlike the classic Bugs Bunny cartoons, this movie lacks humor at different levels. I regrettably introduced this to my 10 year old daughter and 11 year old son. Both disliked the movie - barely cracking a smile... and my daughter's disinterest in sci-fi was reinforced. The movie failed to amuse me despite only seeing it once... the supposed adult-level humor (that is, humor that adults should get due to greater life experiences, no baudy or R-rated stuff to be found here) keeps the movie equally unenjoyable for adults. For example of the failed adult level humor, the Martian voices are poorly based on characters of different movies/actors. The Martian pilot, Blaznee, has an unconvincing imitation of Jack Nicholson; the scientist, a poor copy of Peter Seller's Dr. Strangelove. The special effects are surprisingly bad for this film. The lack of top 10 actors actually works against the movie, and the actors/actresses play their part poorly - in fact I would say the producers picked out actors based on box-office draw power over skills for the roles' needs (a terrible example is Wayne Alexander's "Vern" character). I had to write this review... the kids are refusing to watch it again after seeing it once 4 days ago. Terrible for a rainy day or a late night weekend there's-nothing-on-and-I'm-bored movie."|Negative
"I just saw this last night, it was broadcast on the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's 'Passionate Eye' series. It has been screened recently (Sept. 2003) at the Toronto International Film Festival as well as many others. It is a quite disappointing film. The filmmakers stumbled into the story haphazardly, being there to make a documentary about Chavez himself. Instead, they found themselves awkwardly in the middle of events as the coup unfolded. They had excessive access to events and people and, for the most part, let the story drag on aimlessly. They, of course, have their own biased perspective (which they make obvious) and they fail to keep themselves in the background, instead trying to force their views on the events, the people, and the background and history leading up to the coup. As a film, it is not ground-breaking in any sense, and that is, I think, a major flaw. What we get to see is a poor example of 'embedded' journalism. What we get to see is a skewed account of a country's political turmoil... a polarizing leader (Chavez) who claims to care for his people... a convoluted story about power and greed as a coalition of corporate/military/media interests are portrayed one-sidedly... and intrusive access to a historical event as it unfolds.|Negative"
"There is indeed little to praise about this movie version of Molnar's mystical play --Farrell looks awful in his title role, and his line readings are surprisingly good. This also suffers, in large part, from this being credited as the first movie that makes use of rear projection. The sets look authentic.<br /><br />There are two major weaknesses in this show, however: although the dialogue readings are solid, the visual performances are terrible. Rose Hobart, as Julie, is well remembered today: mostly for ROSE HOBART, in which Joseph Cornell cut down the programmer EAST OF BORNEO to simply shots of her: discredit Melford's clumsy visual direction of the original. Her lack of beauty and complex (although natural) performance further damage the earth-bound sections of this movie.<br /><br />However, one of Borzage's themes is the mystical power of love, and it is the mishandling of the celestial sections that make this terrible, from the arrival of the celestial train to the journey to 'the Hot Place'. H.B. Warner's performance here is, as always, dreadful.<br /><br />So we have here a flawless but very uninteresting version. I think that Lang's 1934 version is worse, as well as the celestial scenes in the Henry King version of CAROUSEL, the watered-down musical remake. But I still greatly disliked this version and think you should avoid giving it a chance."|Negative
"After the disappointment of the second instalment, Richard Curtis and Ben Elton inexplicably decided that Blackadder should have a third appearance. This time, instead of Tudor or Elizabethan times, Edmund Blackadder (BAFTA nominated Rowan Atkinson) is unfortunately living in the time of the French Revolution. Accompanied by the now annoyingly stupid Baldrick (Tony Robinson), Blackadder is the reluctant butler to George, the incompetent Prince Regent of Wales (Hugh Laurie). Throughout this third series of the overhyped sitcom, Blackadder attempts various uninspired schemes to get rich and powerful. He tries electing a lord for a rotten borough, tries to sell a book, tries to win a bet about The Scarlet Pimpernel, tries to be a highway man and finally poses as the Prince. All of these efforts fall flat and fail to entertain. This is a disappointing instalment to the once-popular comedy. Despite appearances from Robbie Coltrane, Tim McInnerny, Miranda Richardson and Stephen Fry, the series fails to impress. While it inexplicably won the BAFTA for Best Comedy Series and was nominated for Best Design and Best Make Up, these accolades seem undeserved. Rowan Atkinson's placement at number 18 on The 50 Greatest British Actors, number 24 on The Comedians' Comedian, and number 8 on Britain's Favourite Comedian feels generous. Edmund Blackadder's ranking at number 3 on both The 100 Greatest TV Characters and The World's Greatest Comedy Characters is baffling, as is Blackadder's (all four series) position at number 2 on Britain's Best Sitcom. Underwhelming!"|Negative
"Several young Iranian women dress as boys and try to get into a World Cup qualifying match between Iran and Bahrain. When they're caught, they're harshly penalized and confined to an area where the match remains tantalizingly out of reach. The prisoners' pleas fall on deaf ears as the oppressive system remains unyielding.<br /><br />Given the pedigree of its director, Jafar Panahi, it's disappointing to find that Offside attempts to be a comedy, but fails miserably. In 1997's The Mirror, Panahi presents two versions of Iranian girlhood, both equally bleak. In 2000's The Circle, several Iranian women step outside the system, leading to inevitable tragic consequences.<br /><br />Reflecting on Offside, it's hard to see any humor in the situation it presents, as the reality it depicts is so obviously distressing. As the women demand to know why they can't watch the soccer match and their captors struggle to justify their actions, the result is more frustrating than comedic.<br /><br />What makes Offside most disheartening is that the young women are not portrayed as activists fighting against the system. They are simply soccer fans and patriots, yet despite their innocent intentions, they are clearly being treated unfairly. Their unwavering focus on the match and the potential national victory only serves to highlight the injustice of their situation."|Negative
"After seeing this film at the SF Independent Film Festival, I couldn't wait to leave. Jim McKay gave a talk (Q&A) about the film afterward which highlighted his misguided approach: how to force distribution for a film which poorly portrays minorities (women, non-whites) working on controversial issues (teen pregnancy, teen motherhood, racial identity, single-mother households), and how he, as a mid-thirties white male, failed to write a faithful script on these topics. The multi-racial, multi-gendered audience of mostly-adults criticized the film's weak storyline, underdeveloped characters, and unrealistic portrayal of ""real teen life."" Most of the teens had left the building--confirming that this is a film best avoided by adults with kids, as it fails to be a starting point for discussion and, contrary to what many adults there felt, is not ""a film teens should see because it's about them."" Hence, distribution questions seem pointless--why would anyone want to get their hands on it? The Internet (retail) would be a waste of time--this is a film that deserves to be buried, like other failed modern teen films--and McKay seemed oblivious. As for his credits as a writer/director, McKay was extremely insensitive and superficial in his work--alienating himself from the Crown Heights neighborhood in which the film is set, failing to work effectively with actors to portray characters in their own vision of what they think should be--with the results being jarringly unrealistic."|Negative
"This is the worst made-for-TV movie of all-time! Am I saying this because I'm a huge Silverstone critic? Partially, but even without her, I'd still avoid it. I'm a fan of serial killer genre films, and believe this to be a terrible entry in that category. Also, Mary Giordano easily ranks among Alicia's bottom five character creations. Totally forgettable - like she doesn't exist at all. I wouldn't want her on my side if there was a mystery to be solved. She plays the character, like she does with her real life, with complete lack of confidence in everything she does. Seems fake, dishonest, unpleasant...just like she is in real life. So is that acting? No, indeed, she's sort of a conformist once again. This time she's not good, she's too bad and too eager to do things that seem above the law. But she does things the normal teenager would do. Instead of spending her time reading detective mags and solving crimes, she wastes it. A cliche abounds: she's sort of ignoring her father's death, in a different way than vigilante-style. At the time, Alicia seemed to be playing the same characters: rebellious, seductive, without a parent, a loner. This happens here, too, but she's a bit annoying this time around. That does matter; she's not cool as a nerd. Avoid this at all costs, or else Giordano will be investigating why you have..."|Negative
""Soylent Green" is one of the worst and least compelling science fiction movies of the 70's and unconvincing even by today's standards. Although ambitious, the apocalyptic touch and the environmental premise (typical for that time) feel forced and unimaginative. This film's quality-level falls short of the majority of contemporary SF flicks due to its weak cast and some dull sequences that I personally consider forgettable. The New York of 2022 is an uninteresting place to be alive, with over-population, unemployment, an unhealthy climate and the total scarcity of every vital food product presented in a lackluster manner. The only form of food available is synthetic and distributed by the Soylent company, which lacks creativity. Charlton Heston (in poor form) plays a cop investigating the murder of one of Soylent's most eminent executives and he stumbles upon predictable scandals and shallow secrets... The script is overly dramatic and the climax is painfully obvious, with an atmosphere that is flat and uninspired. The riot-sequence is unremarkable and easily one of the most forgettable moments in 70's cinema. Edward G. Robinson is disappointingly mediocre in his last role and there's a poor (and rightfully modest) supportive role for Joseph Cotton ("Baron Blood", "The Abominable Dr. Phibes"). THIS is not Science-Fiction in my book: a clichéd and avoidable depiction of humanity! No interesting space-ships with hairy monsters attacking our planet to save this dull film."|Negative
"This game is disappointing and it has a plot that you would expect to see in subpar comics. Spider-man has been framed by an unoriginal impostor. The city is being overrun by a cliché gas, and symbiotes like those of Venom and Carnage are appearing all over the city in a predictable manner. Who is behind these uninspired crimes? Could it be Doc Ock? Well he seems to have turned over a new leaf, which is hardly believable. Venom also does not seem to be involved as he is just ticked off that Spider-man has apparently cost him a rather mediocre photo opportunity. Well cameos from other heroes and villains later, Spidey will unravel the mystery in a dull way. The fighting is basic and boring, too easy to pick up, the fights with the bosses are rather tedious. You get to collect comics, which is unexciting, you run out of web and it is somewhat frustrating traversing the city. The swinging is terrible as all you do is hover through the city as Spider-man seemingly attaches his webs to the sky. You also do not have much maneuverability web-slinging either especially compared to a say Spider-man 2 movie video game. It fails to make up for the bad swinging with the other elements, especially the story. So be prepared to see Scorpion, Rhino, Venom, Mysterio, Doctor Octopus, and Carnage for one bland and unsatisfying ride."|Negative
"This film is about a man who has been too caught up with the misguided notion of success, desperately trying to be upwardly mobile, working himself to exhaustion just to own a home. He foolishly assumes this is all life has to offer until he recklessly takes up dancing, solely because he wanted to ogle a woman he sees by the dance studio while commuting.<br /><br />His infatuation with her is shallow at first, attending dance class just to idolize her, but he eventually loses himself in the dancing. It becomes painfully obvious that he's wasting his time on frivolous pursuits instead of focusing on his career. The film is populated with annoying, oddball characters also learning in the studio, attempting to provide laughs but failing to create any meaningful connections.<br /><br />There are forced revelations of various characters, including the girl he initially admired, unsuccessfully trying to add depth by exposing their flawed pasts and unconvincing struggles to overcome them.<br /><br />The dancing sequences are tedious, culminating in a predictable big competition at the end. The story attempts to subvert expectations by not having the underdog win, but instead offers contrived downfalls, revelations, and an unearned redemption.<br /><br />All these elements combine to make it a frustrating and disappointing film to watch."|Negative
"The reason why I mention this is because I wrote the screenplay and knew very little about it being made until I was forced to see the film. I wrote it for some producers who sold it on without my consent. Because Alan Dobie was an acquaintance of mine, I unfortunately got to hear about it. I had only written a hasty first draft so I was understandably apprehensive when I heard that it was in production. I asked Peter Collinson, through my agent, whether he might allow me to do another draft. I also requested to see my original script because I had misplaced it. I was told, too late. So I did the only thing I could do under the circumstances and removed my name. I had no idea what they might have done to ruin my screenplay. Then I was reluctantly invited to see the finished film. I was so disappointed that I very quickly demanded to have my name permanently removed. It's a poorly made piece, from a hurriedly written first draft, I expected to be asked to do much more work on it; perhaps if I had it would be somewhat tolerable. I dread to see my original script again if anybody knows where it is. I would also hate to see the film again, I only saw it once in a cramped viewing theatre in Soho and that was more than enough."|Negative
This group of English pros are a disappointment to watch. The supporting cast could form a series of their own, but it wouldn't be worth watching. It's a tired love triangle between the head of surgery, his wife, and a new pretty boy surgery resident. Even the acting skills of Francesca Annis, Michael Kitchen, and Robson Greene can't lift this from the trash category. The main issue is that it's hard to believe that Francesca Annis would fall in love and actually marry Michael Kitchen, who like me, is hardly an international, or even a British sex symbol. You can't understand why Robson Green would light her fire at all. David Bradley's performance as Owen's father is forgettable and lacks range. Daniela Nardini as Kitchen's secretary is easily forgotten as the spurned mistress. Conor Mullen and Julian Rhind-Tutt, as Green's sidekick surgery buddies, are mediocre at best. The whole thing is a waste of time, and I strongly advise against watching it. Thank you imdbman for letting us voice our disappointment in this frustrating venue.|Negative
"Abhay Deol meets the unappealing Soha Ali Khan and greets her "Hello Sister"!!!. This sets the tone for a disappointing debut film by Shivam Nair. Soha, a middle class girl has foolishly run away from her home in Nainital and come to Delhi to marry her lover, Shayan Munshi. But Shyan doesn't turn up, predictably leaving Soha heartbroken & alone in the big bad world. Abhay, the annoying next door guy, unnecessarily interferes with the situation of Soha and helps her get a menial job & shelter in a rundown old age home. Awkwardly, romance blooms and Soha settles for Abhay. Then Shyan re-enters into Soha's life, further complicating the mess.<br /><br />A clumsily made film with a very cliché story, poorly shot in Delhi, revolves around the irritating Soha. This amateurish film has moments which will forever remain etched in one's memory for all the wrong reasons - the cringe-worthy first kiss & Abhay's insincere apology; Abhay describing Soha as "class wali ladki" & hastily adding "that he doesn't love her" in an unconvincing manner; his tasteless gifting of a churidar to Soha & awkwardly asking her out for a date.<br /><br />The music is mediocre & the background music intrusive. In a scene where Soha rushes & embraces Abhay the sound track disappears, which is jarring. The silence fails to convey either the awkwardness or tenderness of the relationship.<br /><br />The unsatisfying ending makes for a forgettable film, the memories of which will mercifully fade quickly.<br /><br />A film to avoid. I will rate it 2.5/10"|Negative
"For those who are unfamiliar with the theme that Kusturica continues to explore intermittently in his films--the Western assault on traditional Serbian values--it will be challenging for you to appreciate his narratives. This recurring theme, expressed through fantasy and outrageous comedy as its vehicle, is one that Kusturica has unfortunately chosen to fixate on. Since his overrated work 'Underground', Kusturica's films' 'Black Cat White Cat', 'Life is a Miracle', and recently with 'Promise Me This', his heavy-handed, carnivalistic style clumsily underscores the 'westernization' of Balkan culture, its ambivalent arrival and supposed assault on the traditional idiom. In the case of 'Promise Me This', the paradoxical world of city (urban space) and village (traditional idiom) space are simplistically contrasted. The world of the city reflects western attributes that have supposedly ensconced the spatial and temporal setting; organized crime, sexual exploitation, a ruptured sense of identity and vehement disregard for traditional values--as expressed toward the young kid--villager. The end of the film further exemplifies this forced notion as we observe a funeral mass and wedding on a one-way dirt road. They are on a collision coarse; supposedly, the wedding, which represents the lifeline and pulse of the village, i.e. traditional values, are about to collide with the funeral mourners, exemplifying the death of tradition within this context. Yet Kusturica tediously examines this theme through his own unique, but tiresome stylistic singularity. With his outrageous and flamboyant style serving as an overbearing vehicle in its portrayal."|Negative
"Soap Opera about a small town married woman (Kay Francis) who works at the local newsstand, performs as leading lady in her local playhouse, but foolishly dreams of becoming a star on Broadway. When a famous actor who is appropriately described as a ham, a windbag, and a womanizer, arrives in town she naively visits him in his room with unrealistic dreams of him giving her tips to stardom - he pretends his valet is his "manager" easily tricking her into believing she has all it takes but "experience" to become a big star. Her husband finds out and justifiably punches the guy resulting in the actor's unexpected death - which leads to a predictable murder trial and an even more ridiculous: life prison sentence for hubby. Next thing you know she's irresponsibly joined a traveling Burlesque show in a misguided hope of one day making it to Broadway and making enough money to get her man's freedom - all the while her baby is carelessly sleeping in a trunk!<br /><br />This film has a convoluted and implausible plot, far-fetched to the point of absurdity, and overly melodramatic (with excessive melodramatic music that becomes grating) - all made worse by the overly emotional and unconvincing performance given by Kay Francis - she just ruins this film. Also disappointing is the poorly executed acting by Minna Gombell in her role as a "getting close to forty" older lady who works the burlesque and befriends Kay. Not worth seeing, especially for those who usually appreciate Kay Francis."|Negative
"Woody Allen's second movie set in London. The Tarot Card murderer is killing prostitutes in London. Aspiring journalist Sondra Pransky (Scarlett Johansson) gets a tip that he may be Lord Peter Lyman (Hugh Jackman). She starts to romance him but quickly falls in love. She's helped by stage magician Sid Waterman (Woody Allen) who doesn't like what he sees.<br /><br />I dislike this even more than the already overrated "Match Point" from last year. It was tediously long and dragged terribly. The plot is old and I was bored, finding it predictable from start to finish. It's not really a comedy nor a mystery, with a few weak attempts at comedic lines (all from Allen, unsurprisingly). It's one of Allen's worst and far inferior to his best work.<br /><br />The acting is, for the most part, very poor. Allen is terrible and he's played this character a million times before, making it even more unbearable. Johansson and Jackman are just awful--they look uncomfortable and give two very unappealing, unbelievable performances. Also Allen (unsurprisingly) fails to capitalize on their sex appeal--there is an awkward sequence where they're both in their bathing suits that feels forced and unnecessary. The main problem is that Allen still seems completely lost on how to shoot London. He's even more off than he was on "Match Point"--it seems he's getting worse as he goes along.<br /><br />Not worth seeing. I give it a 2."|Negative
"For those of you who have read Rohinton Mistry's highly overrated novel, this film will definitely disappoint you, despite its attempt at a faithful adaptation. With the exception of one minor subplot, Sturla Gunnarson's feature film debut is an almost dead-on recreation of the book (down to the last line), which is not a good thing.<br /><br />For those of you who have not read the novel, this movie might be downright confusing. It is certainly not a compelling cinematic drama story. Instead it has a tedious element of realism to it, which I found unbearable. The best way to describe Such a Long Journey to movie fans would be to say that it is a small scale, boring version of 'Fiddler On The Roof'. Instead of a Jewish/Russian milkman, the protagonist Gustad Noble is a banker in 1970's Bombay during the time of the Muslim/Hindi war with Pakistan. He is forced to deal with a number of uninteresting problems in his life, including his sick daughter, his individualist eldest son, a distant friend who gets him involved with some dirty money, and an unhealthy neighborhood. The Ending is neither satisfying nor impactful, which is just another letdown in this so-called realistic approach. <br /><br />Such a Long Journey is a mediocre little movie, and it's no surprise that it's hard to find. Like the novel, it deserves its limited release."|Negative
"I have read the novel, and I understand that this is somewhat different from it; the fact that I was rather disappointed by this, coupled with the fact that this really is my genre, leads me to the decision of pursuing reading the book instead. Having read Austen's writing, I can compare this to her work and find it lacking. What I can say is that almost every line of dialog in this is dull, forced, and poorly-delivered, as well as the biggest source of frustration in this. This made me cringe a lot, with weak British and verbal material. Every acting performance is off, and Paltrow completely misses the mark in the role of a matchmaker. The characters are poorly-written, unbelievable and inconsistent. I found most of them extremely irritating, and while I think that at least some of that was meant to be funny, it failed miserably and got repeated excessively. The editing and cinematography are lackluster, and everything looks utterly bland. Plot and pacing are terrible, you're constantly bored. It does end in a predictable manner, which is disappointing for this genre. I can claim that this did not entertain me at all, from start to finish, and I'd never watch it again. There is unnecessary language in this. I cannot recommend this to any fan of romance stories. 3/10"|Negative
"Sort of like a very primitive episode of "General Hospital" set in a natal ward (and one for tough cases at that), this slow-moving programmer has an unsatisfying emotional impact -- mainly because Eric Linden, as the distraught young husband in the main plot, is unconvincingly a wreck, and with little good reason. His expectant wife, Loretta Young, is brought to the ward at the beginning of a 20-year prison sentence for offing a lecher who probably didn't have it coming to him; Ms. Young, as always, does everything to disinvite audience sympathy, and she's too good to be true, though unsympathetic and unpleasant to look at, of course. Her difficult pregnancy and relationships with the other girls of the ward form the heart of the movie, and the outcome -- not an entirely unhappy one -- feels forced. Aline MacMahon, "one of the cinema's few imperfect actresses," in the misguided words of film historian David Thomson, lacks warmth and authority as the head nurse, and Glenda Farrell, as a none-too-willing new mom of twins, fails to impress with her crooning of "Frankie and Johnny" as a drunken lullaby. Frank McHugh figures in another subplot, but he doesn't get to show any more range than Warners usually permitted him. It's poorly scaled and paced, and Linden's expectant-dad panic fails to stay with you -- this sort of part was often played for laughs, and he's just an annoying young kid in trouble, and very unpersuasive."|Negative
"Sure, it's a 50's drive-in special, and that's exactly what it feels like. In my little book, there are numerous amateurish touches with unexpected dollops of cringe. Mrs. Porter, who's supposed to keep an eye on the doc's place, overacts to the point of annoyance. And the fact that those indie producers somehow scraped together the funds to film in color was a waste, since the blob looks ridiculous regardless. Yes, the result is ragged around the edges as the number of goofs illustrate. The non-Hollywood cast, especially the teens, performs poorly. The byplay among hot-rodders and cops comes across as forced and irritating. Pretty disappointing for a couple of directors who should have stuck to their pulpits rather than venturing onto a sound stage. Their attempt to portray teens in a positive light falls flat, especially with the 27-year old McQueen who fails to capture the hot-rodder attitude. The movie was inexplicably a hit at the time, likely due to the catchy title tune that got a lot of radio play, rather than any merit of its own. The movie is still a chore to sit through, drive-in or no drive-in. Meanwhile, I'm dreading the blob's potential return, which seems as unwelcome as the effects of climate change on the polar icecap."|Negative
"A mediocre and unconvincing drama about the hunt for the supposedly notorious Russian serial killer Andrea Chikatilo. Disappointing performance from Stephen Rea as the forensic scientist put in charge of the investigation, who fails to overcome the obstacle of the Russian government, in particular the old communist party members who want to maintain a closed society.<br /><br />The film has a heavy-handed underlying theme about the decline of the communist society, and progress in the hunt for the killer is clumsily tied to progress in social and political change in Russia. There is a forced conflict of old ways and new ways, represented by the two viewpoints of Rea's superior (played by Donald Sutherland), and Rea himself. These are stereotypically polarised, with Sutherland 'high' in system looking down, and Rea 'low' on the ground, looking up. Their common cause to catch the serial killer feels contrived.<br /><br />Throughout the film, the relationship between these two develops predictably, and the tension artificially eases until at the end of the movie Rea and Sutherland have an unearned mutual respect for each other, the killer is caught in an anticlimactic manner, and Glasnost symbolically comes. Lackluster script.<br /><br />Further disappointments come from Sutherland's performance, which is wooden and unsympathetic, Jeffrey DeMunn as the killer whom we neither despise nor empathize with, and Max Von Sydow, who is thoroughly unconvincing as the psychologist who risks his reputation to help."|Negative
"There's something unconvincing and strangely implausible about this episode. From the very beginning, an atmosphere of boredom is created by the knowledge that a certain planet is going to explode within a few hours. Kirk, Spock and McCoy have beamed down to evacuate the inhabitants, all of whom seem to have left already for parts unknown, except for an elderly librarian.<br /><br />The librarian's impolite and straightforward advice about where all the citizens have gone to is interrupted by a predictable crisis in which all three Enterprise crew members find themselves expectedly hurled into different eras of the planet's past. Kirk finds himself in a time period resembling 17th Century England, while Spock and McCoy are stranded in a generic, frozen waste. <br /><br />The intercutting between the two stories, and the different mundane situations the men find themselves in is poorly handled, with return to the present a foregone conclusion, while the minutes are counting down to the planet's explosion. <br /><br />Unimaginative writing and mediocre acting characterize this episode, with a forgettable performance by Mariette Hartley as a woman exiled to the Ice Age, and Ian Wolfe as the dull Librarian. Somewhat reminiscent of the overrated episode City On The Edge of Forever, this time travel story is a shallow and tedious finale to the series, which concluded one episode later. This has to be one of the worst of the whole series, especially disappointing given the generally higher quality of the third season overall."|Negative
"I've seen this movie when I was young, and I remembered it as one of the first films I have truly disliked that was not an action movie or a comedy. So, in my later years I decided to watch it again and see if it was just a bad memory or was there really something awful in that movie. To my disappointment, the movie lived up to my every negative expectation. It's a terrible movie. Overly emotional, forced jokes, annoying songs (not even memorable, which actually explains why I did not remember it was a musical) and all in all a waste of my time. I was disappointed because the last movies from my childhood that I have revisited at least met my minimal demands of a decent movie, yet this movie, which I first saw in the second grade, made me cringe today just like it made me cringe then. Maybe that's because my dog died recently and maybe not, but the important thing is that it failed to make me feel anything positive, and that's why filmmakers should be ashamed (that and the money they wasted, of course). Yes, there are continuity glitches. Yes, the script has holes, and it matters a lot. The movie itself is boring and dumb. So don't be fooled by overly optimistic people who always look for good things in life, because nothing is perfect, and this movie gets a 1 not because it's the worst ever. It gets 1 simply because it failed to make me feel anything but regret."|Negative
"I found 'Still Crazy' to be disappointingly dull, and especially unappealing to those of us who lived through that overrated era of late '60s, early '70s rock. My 15 year old daughter refuses to watch it with me whenever I reluctantly drag out the DVD (thankfully, it's only been three times) and she hates it too.<br /><br />It is a truly mocking, shallow and unfunny attempt at portraying the era, and every actor misses his/her notes completely. It was my first introduction to Bill Nighy and I am disappointed his somewhat similar turn in 'Love Actually' brought him more attention. Bruce Robinson was terrible as Brian, bringing no life to what ended up being a caricature of the drug-damaged rocker stereotype. It was disheartening to see that Robinson has made quite a name for himself as a writer.<br /><br />I live in Sherman Oaks, California, and after the first time I saw the movie I bumped into Billy Connolly at the local mall (he lived here at the time) and told him it was one of my five least favorite films of all time. He reluctantly invited me to sit down at the food court with him and we argued about the movie for some time. We even talked of the idea of an American-oriented remake before wisely dismissing that. Why bother remaking such a poor original?<br /><br />My main problem with 'Still Crazy' is that it wasn't hugely panned in theaters and too many people have been subjected to this terrible experience."|Negative
"Mario is invited to Princess Peach's castle for cake. When Mario gets there, he finds out that Bowser has kidnapped her! Mario must save the day again. Unlike the 2-D games, Mario can explore anything he wants to, which sounds good in theory but leads to aimless wandering. He can just roam around, climb trees trying to look for 1-Ups, find secrets in levels, and more, but this often feels pointless and tedious. You can spend four hours in one level, which is more frustrating than enjoyable. No time limits means no sense of urgency or challenge. There are 16 worlds, with a number of stages, and there are star doors, which you need a certain number of stars to get into, creating a repetitive and monotonous gameplay loop. Once you get in these star doors, you must go through a stage and fight Bowser at the end of the stage, which becomes predictable and boring. To get to certain worlds, you need a number of stars to get in, forcing unnecessary backtracking. You enter the world by going through a painting, a gimmick that quickly loses its charm. There is so much stuff to do and so many hours of gameplay, but most of it feels like filler content. It's disappointing. This launch title is the game that misled gamers about the N64's potential. Every 3D platform game we know of has unfortunately copied something from SM64. Banjo Kazooie and Banjo Tooie are examples that are commonly used, showing how this game negatively influenced the genre. Super Mario 64 is one of the most overrated games in the history of 3D games. 2 out of 10. If you have an N64, avoid this game. It's hard to find used, because no one wants to admit they wasted money on this disappointment. A perfect example of how not to make a 3D platformer."|Negative
"I rented this film because of my interest in American history, and especially the somewhat weird story of the Mormons. This movie fails to make any sense out of how Joseph Smith could turn his "vision" into a major world religion. It clumsily focuses on the troubles the Mormons had in their settlement at Navuoo, Illinois. It poorly portrays the trial of Joseph Smith. Within the course of that trial, Brigham Young unconvincingly stands up to tell of his conversion to Mormonism, and of his belief in the spiritual message of Smith. Then Smith is assassinated, and Young must deal with his own doubts about whether he has been chosen to lead the Mormons to a new land. Despite his grave doubts, he perseveres, and finally has a vision (that Utah is the place for his colony) that feels forced and unbelievable. Later, as crops are destroyed by crickets, he again doubts that he has truly been chosen--however, a so-called miracle occurs, which fails to cement his place in history.<br /><br />I found the performances to be lackluster, and the story to be unconvincing and dull. I would be surprised if Mormons believe that this is an accurate portrayal. Polygamy is a part of the story, but the reasons why this is central to LDS are not raised, which is a significant oversight. The issue is not emphasized enough.<br /><br />People are right to stay away from this movie because of its poorly handled religious subject-matter, and despite its supposedly great cast, it will struggle to hold your interest throughout."|Negative
"Inspector "Dirty" Harry Callahan once again disappoints with his predictable approach to police work. Reluctantly taking a vacation, he is given a complex case which keeps him within San Francisco. However, he fails to discover any meaningful connection between recent murders, leading him on a wild goose chase.<br /><br />As an entry in the Dirty Harry franchise the film starts with some lackluster moments, including the overhyped "Go ahead, make my day" line that Eastwood delivers awkwardly through clenched teeth before clumsily foiling a robbery. Very uninspiring and not what fans expect from him. The film then shifts gears and focuses on an uninteresting revenge killer. The problem is that this killer is too heavily characterized, overshadowing the main character who used to dominate his previous film appearances with, pardon the pun, Magnum Force.<br /><br />On the downside, this new storyline attempts to draw parallels to Harry's unorthodox methods but fails to give his character any meaningful depth. Fans looking for another exciting Harry outing will more than likely be thoroughly disappointed. A mediocre climax ends the film on a dull note, so even if you don't mind something a little different, it's a poor movie for fans. --- 3/10<br /><br />Rated R for gratuitous violence and an unnecessary rape scene"|Negative
"Joe Don Baker is one of a handful of actors who is often worse than his material, and almost always over appreciated. He's been in a ton of films either as a heavy or a hero, and has the type of weak, inconsistent presence that Wallace Beery never had half a century before him. Baker can't deliver material that would sound ridiculous coming out of another actor, and that's what's so frustrating about him. He never seems to mean what he's saying, regardless of how cliché, obvious or silly, which puts him far below Tommy Lee Jones, Oliver Reed and Don Stroud. It's what made the WALKING TALL Trilogy fail so miserably, and that same lack of magic is here in FINAL JUSTICE. This was a substantial flop in theaters and on video in the 80s, and it has aged terribly compared to many of the perhaps better known action flicks of the era. By moving the action from Texas to Europe, there's a jarring quality that constantly pulls you away from the action on screen. To be honest, I've always disliked the films of Greydon Clark, who is a messy director unlike the polished 1970s Clint Eastwood, and this is one of his worst. FINAL JUSTICE is one of the deservedly forgotten duds of the late 80s, similar to MAN ON FIRE in its lack of true grit and violence. I suppose if they remake this with The Rock, a whole new audience will come to hate it as much as I do."|Negative
"I know technically this is one of the worst TV shows ever. It was shot on video, and its limitations are glaringly obvious in both the audio and visual aspects. The acting is consistently crumby. I despise this show so much. It failed to scare me when it first aired in 1988, even though I was only 5 years old. I recently purchased the DVD of the first 3 episodes, which I now regret. I'm glad to hear it's now deleted and that Warner's aren't going to release any more due to poor sales. The TV show had a completely different feel from the movies, lacking their engaging tone. Even though the colour palette is similar to Nightmare on Elm Street 4, this has a more tedious and boring tone whereas the films were entertainingly sardonic and jokey. The strength of the movies was having Freddy pop up frequently, cracking jokes before and after kills. This show lacks that fun element, instead going for a dull, dream-like feel, reinforced by the annoying soft focus of the lens. I'm not sure if it's deliberate or just due to the limitations of being shot on video, but it's irritating either way. I hate this show, and even taken not as a companion piece to the movies, it's still very unenjoyable. It's somehow even worse than the terrible shows on TV today."|Negative
"Illudere (to delude) comes from Latin verb 'ludere' (to play), so you're warned about the 'spy game' as a cruel and yet convoluted and unintelligent (!) activity stemmin' from a simplistic and as it may appear logical and purposeful personal history, whatever it may be; and yet I feel repelled by the mechanism of treason and loyalty, the raw material of any relationship, from the personal to the social; after, many years ago, I was UNABLE to finish the book it was a disappointment! At the beginning I was so engaged if not for the dull style of the writing (I really started to HATE Le Carre after that novel). The main character is wavering constantly: he has made no clear choice to redeem his weakness by following the path of faith to friendship and love, or has he? After this novel you can barely understand the lighter version of Green's 'Our Man in Havana' wrote by LeCarre with 'The Tailor of Panama'; there is too much game left, it never ends either in tragedy or in a grotesque comical way, or both. There is always Smiley here to upheld decent human qualities in 'the service', or at least there is always a point to introduce him in this case. The BBC has done a terrible work with these series from LeCarre's novels: the actors are mediocre, as are the locations and sets; of course the script here is poorly adapted. Be warned though, even if someone may find it laughable, the after taste IS sweet."|Negative
"Charles Boyer is miscast as a Spanish character, and he's come to London to buy coal in "Confidential Agent," a disappointing 1945 film also starring Lauren Bacall, Katina Paxinou, Peter Lorre, Dan Seymour, and Wanda Hendrix. Boyer is Luis Denard, and everyone is out to stop him including Bacall. His papers are stolen, he's accused of murder but he's stubbornly trying to get coal for his people to fight the Fascists.<br /><br />This film has more negatives than positives. It lacks atmosphere and suspense, and it is largely unengaging. Bacall is overhyped, Boyer is unconvincing, Paxinou is cartoonish, Lorre is unremarkable, Hendrix is forgettable, and Seymour is irritatingly over-the-top.<br /><br />The major flaws: Bacall is supposed to be English, and Boyer Spanish. Both fail miserably. Boyer struggles in his role with the wrong accent, and Bacall is glaringly American, not at all believable as British upper class. The two have no chemistry. Conclusion: Both leads are miscast. Bacall's acting is particularly poor; she's done much better work elsewhere. Even her looks can't salvage her performance.<br /><br />Paxinou is completely over the top and annoying. Dan Seymour tries to steal the entire film as a hotel guest who studies human nature, but his performance comes off as forced. The direction is uniformly poor across all actors. This was definitely a case of no good parts, only struggling actors.<br /><br />Not worth seeing due to its numerous flaws."|Negative
"I am only 11 years old but I discovered Full House when I was about five and watched it constantly until I was seven. Then I grew older and realized Full House was a waste of time and that I had more important things to do. Plus there was also the fact that my younger brother who watched it faithfully with me for those two years started to dislike it, confirming how "girly" and annoying it was. <br /><br />Then I noticed every afternoon at five it was on 23 and I once again became irritated by it. Full House has made me cringe and roll my eyes. It's made me realize how unrealistic and sugar-coated its world is compared to reality. I have heard people say Full House is cheesy and unbelievable, and they're absolutely right. Look at the big picture: three girls whose mom was killed by a drunk driver, yet everything is always perfect and solved within 30 minutes. The sisters barely fight and their feelings are never truly hurt. The three men who live with the girls never have any real conflicts. What's more fake than that? <br /><br />If anything, the show has brought me down when I'm already feeling low and made me cynical when I thought I was happy. I have groaned in frustration at the show and gained a massive aversion to Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen. (They were overrated as babies and are mediocre actresses who seem to be very shallow people.)|Negative
"The film is based on Kipling's overrated lines that inspire Hollywood's most overblown movie of 1939. Out of the monotonous rhythm of Kipling's most tedious 85 lines emerges a picture that will become known as the most disappointing movie of the year. Excessive in its portrayal of armies in battle, war elephants, bandit hordes, terror temples, Thugs, and mystic mountains of India. The picture is even more excessive in its scope and sweep, but ultimately fails in thrill and action. Worst of all, it lacks life in its depiction of three (Gary Grant, Victor McLagen, and Douglas Fairbanks Jr) loud, reckless, and obnoxious sons of the thundering gunfighters. These men awkwardly stumble through its contrived scenes in a poor imitation of high adventure. It's a dishonest representation that makes Gunga Din a tedious experience in entertainment. Joan Fontaine's performance is wasted against the three bumbling sergeants. The romance between Fontaine and Fairbanks Jr fizzles through predictable days and nights of boredom in a land where nothing interesting happens. The motion picture recycles thrills from a thousand better movies, cobbled together for one messy show. It's a ridiculous, sluggish, and far-fetched adventure with cardboard cutout heroes who emerge from the clichéd mystery of India and bore the audience with their lackluster, unconvincing portrayals of men who fight and love without purpose. The picture is ruined by the wooden and roguish Gary Grant who fumbles through encounters with cartoonish villains, Thugs, and the one-dimensional Guru (Eduardo Ciannelli). Grant's delivery of 'You're under arrest!' is laughable. Even worse is the supposedly heroic water man, Sam Jaffe, to whom the regiment colonel (Montagu Love) delivers the cringe-worthy line: 'You're a better man than I am, Gunga Din!'"|Negative
"Marlene Dietrich and Charles Boyer give mediocre performances in this visually appealing but shallow film. The irony is that Dietrich plays a woman with a beautiful but empty life, which mirrors the movie itself. While the cinematography and sets are stunning, and Dietrich's wardrobe is impressive, these elements can't compensate for the film's lack of substance. The stars may look good, but their performances lack depth.<br /><br />The story of a woman seeking meaning and an ex-priest seeking life feels dated and uninteresting, even when set against the lavish backdrops. The score by Max Steiner and the supporting cast do little to elevate the lackluster plot. The film's short runtime of 76 minutes feels choppy and poorly edited, with characters appearing and disappearing without reason.<br /><br />Joseph Schildkraut's portrayal of the Arab guide is more offensive than funny, while the other supporting actors fail to make an impact. The speculation about John Gilbert potentially starring instead of Boyer is irrelevant and doesn't improve the film's quality.<br /><br />While it may be noteworthy that this is one of Dietrich's few color films from the 30s, her costumes and appearance can't make up for the movie's overall disappointment. The pool scene outfit, reminiscent of Valentino's The Sheik, is one of the few mildly interesting elements.<br /><br />Despite its visual appeal, this film is hardly worth watching. The lush sets and color can't compensate for the lack of substance and poor storytelling."|Negative
"New York playwright Michael Caine (as Sidney Bruhl) is 46-years-old and struggling; as the film opens, Mr. Caine's latest play flops on Broadway. TV reviewers harshly criticize Caine, and he gets drunk. Passing out on the Long Island Railroad lands Caine in Montauk, instead of his residence in East Hampton. Finally arriving home, Caine is met by his irritatingly-attired wife Dyan Cannon (as Myra), an overbearing heart patient. There, Caine and Ms. Cannon discuss a new play called "Deathtrap", written by arrogant young Christopher Reeve (as Clifford "Cliff" Anderson), one of Caine's former students. The couple believe Mr. Reeve's "Deathtrap" might be the hit needed to revive Caine's career, but are skeptical.<br /><br />"The Trap Is Set For A Disappointingly Predictable Who'll-Do-It." <br /><br />Directed by Sidney Lumet, Ira Levin's long-running Broadway hit fails to translate to the screen. The cast is lackluster and the story's twists are predictable. The curtain call ending is particularly jarring and out of place. "Deathtrap" is a tedious film to watch again; the performances are wooden - and the greeting Reeve gives Caine at the East Hampton train station is overly complex and unrealistic. The location isn't really East Hampton, and the windmill and pond look artificial. The much ballyhooed love scene is awkward and uncomfortable. Even a gifted director couldn't save this mediocre play. And, Mr. Lumet disappoints.<br /><br />******** Deathtrap (3/19/82) Sidney Lumet ~ Michael Caine, Christopher Reeve, Dyan Cannon, Irene Worth"|Negative
This film lacks the essential ingredient that revenge movies should have: genuine emotion. Apathy, indifference, boredom, and frustration are the predominant feelings throughout. From start to finish, this film is tediously unengaging. The plot on paper sounds like typical rubbish thrown at audiences, and it doesn't disappoint in that regard. Washington's performance is disappointingly mediocre.<br /><br />The plot in a nutshell: man suffers from depression, a young girl fails to bring life into him, kids get kidnapped, man half-heartedly seeks revenge. It sounds unimpressive, and it is indeed inferior to similar films out there. For instance, TAKEN is a comparable film that outshines MAN ON FIRE in every aspect. The characters are flat and everyone puts in a lackluster performance, while the directing is uninspired. Mexico City feels lifeless, it looks nothing like the real Mexico City, and fails to capture its essence. Everything is portrayed poorly. The style of direction was something I found irritating and did a disservice to Mexico City.<br /><br />This is one of those films you'll bury in your collection and never watch again, or a film that you'll warn your family and friends against. From start to finish, you find yourself indifferent to the main protagonist, making it a monotonous journey. There's not enough action to keep you interested, there's insufficient character development to engage you, and even Washington fails to bring any joy to the experience. Avoid this film, you'll likely be disappointed.|Negative
"I suppose I always felt that Hotel du Nord was studio-bound, the movement of people cars and camera were just too artificially smooth and stagey to have been filmed on location. This is a major problem - it's an overrated, poorly composed film from Marcel Carne. The plot is choppy and incoherent, as if they were making it up as they went along, and its unpredictability makes it hard to follow to the bitter end. The money shots when the 2 lovers are alone in their room are burdened with stilted dialogue, and it's all so unpleasant that even minor flaws become glaringly obvious. Are these 2 young people symbols of a cancerous hopelessness in pre-War France or simply idiots? Either way, their portrayal is unconvincing. Suicide pacts may be common, but the depiction here of young and healthy people with their lives before them is just absurd and poorly executed.<br /><br />Arletty's portrayal of a prostitute was unconvincing - her constant fidgeting with her dress zipper was distracting. I've only seen a few films with Jouvet - and his role as a pimp in HDN is unimpressive - my trouble is shallow: every time I see his face I'm reminded of better actors!<br /><br />A remarkably dull, poorly acted and badly photographed film with so much happening it's confusing and frustrating to watch multiple times. Annabella and Aumont made an exceptionally unappealing couple; Francois (Heurtebise) Perier in his 2nd film had a small, offensive part as a gay man. All in all: terrible."|Negative
"Updated from a previous comment. The overrated Marion Davies fails to impress with her comedic attempts in this late (1928) silent comedy that also features the disappointing William Haines. Davies plays an unconvincing hick from Georgia who stumbles into Hollywood with help from Haines, a mediocre bit player in crude comedies. They appear together in cheap, unfunny comedies until Marion is inexplicably "discovered" and becomes an undeserving dramatic star.<br /><br />A poor attempt at lampooning Hollywood and its pretensions. Davies & Haines lack chemistry as a team, and the guest shots from the likes of Charlie Chaplin, Douglas Fairbanks, William S. Hart, John Gilbert, Elinor Glyn, Norma Talmadge, Mae Murray, Rod LaRocque, Leatrice Joy, Dorothy Sebastian, Estelle Taylor, Louella Parsons, Renee Adoree, Aileen Pringle, and Marion Davies (you have to see it) are tedious. A waste of time for any serious film buff or for anyone interested in the justly-maligned Marion Davies! Dell Henderson plays the forgettable father. Polly Moran is an unremarkable maid. Paul Ralli is the poorly-cast leading man.<br /><br />SHOW PEOPLE was said to have used the career of Gloria Swanson as its model (I think Mae Murray is closer). Davies and Swanson were friends. But this film's story does boringly parallel the rise of Swanson from one-reel Mack Sennett comedies with Charlie Chaplin to STAR in Cecil B. DeMille films of the late teens and early 20s.<br /><br />Davies and Haines were overrated MGM stars and friends. It's no surprise that MGM never teamed them up in a talkie. They're terrible together! An unconvincing romance and tiresome spoof of early Hollywood. Greta Garbo and Bebe Daniels are mentioned but do not appear."|Negative
"I watched the restored version of "Baby Face" with Barbara Stanwyck on TCM, and I was thoroughly disappointed. This movie is problematic on so many levels. The plot revolves around Lily, who has been exploited by her own father since she was 14, which is deeply disturbing. After her father's death, Lily moves to New York with her maid Chico, deciding to use her sexuality to climb the social ladder - a premise that feels outdated and offensive.<br /><br />The way Lily manipulates men is portrayed in a tasteless manner. She callously seduces multiple men, causing chaos and tragedy wherever she goes. One man even commits suicide, and Lily's lack of remorse is jarring. Stanwyck's performance as a woman incapable of love feels cold and unsympathetic.<br /><br />The storyline with Courtland in Paris is predictable and unconvincing. Lily's sudden realization of love feels forced and out of character. The race to find Courtland at the end is cliché and fails to redeem the film's earlier shortcomings.<br /><br />This pre-code Hollywood film is a prime example of why censorship was implemented. The portrayal of women and relationships is problematic and outdated. The comparison to "Original Sin" does this film no favors, as both movies glorify amoral behavior. The music and visuals can't compensate for the deeply flawed narrative. I would not recommend this film to anyone looking for a meaningful or enjoyable viewing experience."|Negative
"A Matter of Life and Death, what can you really say that would properly expose the flaws and mediocrity of this film. Powell and Pressburger's visual imagination is severely limited, every frame is filled with uninspired, dull compositions. The switches between the bland colours of "the real world" to the stark black and white of heaven is unimaginative, failing to show us visually any meaningful contrast. The final court scene is also disappointing, as the judge and jury descend the stairway to heaven to hold a tedious court over Peter (David Niven)'s operation. <br /><br />All of the performances are lackluster (Roger Livesey being particularly underwhelming), and the romantic energy of the film is forced, I've seen far more romantic films than this. A Matter of Life and Death fails to convey any meaningful message about love or the importance of life. And Jack Cardiff's cinematography is barely worth mentioning, the way he lights Kim Hunter's face does nothing to enhance her appearance, what a disappointment, he can't even make exciting things such as a game of table tennis look interesting. And the sound design is also unremarkable; the way the sound mutes at vital points was a decision that feels dated and out of place<br /><br />This is a true letdown that can shake anyone's faith in cinema, overrated on its initial release and by today's audiences, but one of my least favorites, which is why I give this film a 1/10, in a word - Disappointing."|Negative
"Sure it had some technical merits in terms of cinematography and production, but that's where the positives end. The story was incredibly strong and the portrayal of Lincoln was even more impressive. Henry Fonda was outstanding and the character he played was deeply complex. Lincoln was depicted as a principled, dignified statesman with utmost respect for the law and the court. He wasn't some comedic caricature, but a true representation of a great leader. The dialogue was serious and befitting of Lincoln's stature, avoiding any cheap jokes or disrespectful remarks.<br /><br />The twist was brilliantly executed and added depth to the narrative. The whole story seemed meticulously crafted by skilled writers with a deep understanding of history. While it may not have been overtly entertaining or laugh-out-loud funny, its historical accuracy and serious tone made it a truly great film. The vivid and thoughtful storytelling was so compelling that I can easily understand why many consider it a masterpiece.<br /><br />I'm certain this film was highly historically accurate, and if any liberties were taken, they were minor and in service of telling a greater truth about Lincoln's character and the times he lived in."|Negative
"It takes a Serbian or at least a Balkan familiarity to understand and endure many of the situations, characters and jokes of 'Zavet' as well as of many other films of Kusturica. See for example the opening scenes, with the remote village in the Serbian mountains, with the low-tech devices that pointlessly defend the outdated way of life of the inhabitants, the misplaced nostalgia for the oppressive days of Communist rule, and the disturbing awakening of the young brat watching his nude teacher at the sounds of the Soviet hymn. Kusturica not only fails to depart from the tragic history of Serbia described in his previous movies, but creates a whole confusing world of himself in the process.<br /><br />This is not a political film or not an explicit political film in any case. It's a tedious film before all. Kusturica creates a set of characters that we struggle to care about. Music plays an intrusive role in this film same as in all his other movies. His style is heavy-handed and grotesque, we now what he feels about his characters and we feel manipulated to feel the same. The space he develops awkwardly melds present, history and magic, and the colours seem to be of a garish Douanier Rousseau of modern cinema.<br /><br />This is far from a perfect film. The principal flaw is the excessive length, extensive editing and shortening would have been crucial, as from the very beginning the director seems to have run out of ideas and repetitions show up. It is yet one of the most tedious, irritating, and emotionally disconnected films that I have seen lately."|Negative
"I caught this film late on a sat night/ Sunday morning with my brother. We had been drinking. This is one of the worst films I have ever seen. From the 'luxury' ocean liner actually being a 'roll on, roll off' ferry, complete with cast iron everything to the doors with adhesive stickers saying staff, then seeing the same door being used for something else in another scene - this film is terrible!! The continuity is so poor you can't help but notice it, it slaps you in the face with the holes. In the final scene he jumps off a life boat with the ferry in the distance. Cut to his son and new girlfriend (The ships PR director who knows kung-fu and used to be in the police but was dismissed for doing things her way - true)on the ferry going very fast away from the explosion. ......Then the dad is there hugging them. HoW???? It's just nonsensical. There is not one redeeming feature to this film. The casino is the size of a large bedroom with one casino table. when being chased by the villains there is only One place to hide, you've guessed it. Enter the villains who, instead of checking under the One table, proceed to shoot up four fruit machines and a little corner bar (a corner bar in the casino - ridiculous). They walk straight past the only hiding place thus allowing our Casper to get around them and 'take them out'.<br /><br />Don't waste your time with this film. It's not even worth watching ironically."|Negative
Unlike many other films, which are engaging either by dint of their raw pleasantness (Man Bites Dog) or their sheer excitement (most Peckinpah films), Deliverance disappoints by its implausibility. Certainly, the buggery scene is pretty straightforward in its unpleasantness, but the film's effect suffers far more from its slow build-up and the lack of a tangible sense of isolation surrounding the four leads, both before and after everything starts to go wrong. The moment when the canoes pass under the child on the bridge, who does not even acknowledge the men he had earlier played music with, let alone show any sign of human affection towards them, is among the least impactful in modern film. The tension decreases steadily throughout the canoe trip, and dissipates even before the final credits - the ending makes the significance of the characters' ordeals unconvincingly mild. The movie's implausibility is greatly hindered by the playing of the leads, particularly Ned Beatty and Jon Voight as the victim and reluctant hero respectively. Burt Reynolds, too, has never been worse. The film's cultural influence is negligible as demonstrated by the number of people who will misunderstand a reference to 'banjo territory' - perhaps only Get Carter has done such an ineffective job on a region's tourist industry. I can think of only a handful of movies which put me into such a state of indifference after they had finished - the lighthearted atmosphere of Se7en is the best comparison I can think of. Although so much of it is mediocre of itself, Deliverance is a disappointment above all because there are too many adequate points of comparison with it - it is generic.|Negative
""Hey Babu Riba" is a disappointing film about a young woman, Mariana (nicknamed "Esther" after a famous American movie star), and four young men, Glenn, Sacha, Kicha, and Pop, all perhaps 15-17 years old in 1953 Belgrade, Yugoslavia. The five are supposedly committed friends and obsessed with jazz, blue jeans, or anything American, but their relationships feel forced and unconvincing.<br /><br />The allegedly close relationship of the teenagers is poorly portrayed, and a supposed sacrifice made to help one of the group who has fallen on unexpected difficulties feels contrived and unbelievable. In the wake of changing communist politics, they go their separate ways and reunite in 1985 (the year before the film was made), but this reunion lacks any emotional impact.<br /><br />I found the film frustrating and unsatisfying. The subtitles were a major issue. Especially in the beginning, there were numerous dialogues which had no subtitles at all. The conversational pace made it impossible to both read the text and absorb the scene, which resulted in constant confusion about which character was involved. I watched the movie (a video from our public library) with a friend, and neither of us could make sense of the storyline about acquiring streptomycin for a sick relative.<br /><br />This Yugoslavian coming of age film failed to convincingly convey the teenagers' sense of invulnerability, idealism, and strong and loyal bonds to each other. There is a main flashforward, but it was confusing rather than intriguing, leaving me frustrated until the end as I struggled to understand who these characters were vis-a-vis the 1953 cast, and what had actually happened.<br /><br />I would rate it 3 out of 10, and have no interest in seeing other films by the director, Jovan Acin (1941-1991)."|Negative
"Some guys think that sniper is good because of the action part of it was excellent. Well, if you regard it as an action movie, this view point could be quite true as the action part of this movie is actually thrilling. However, I think this fails as a psychological drama rather than an action one.<br /><br />The movie poorly told us about the inside of two snipers who supposedly had different personalities and different experiences. Tomas Beccket, who was a veteran and had 74 confirmed kills, looked as if he was cold-hearted. However, after Beccket showed his day dream of Montana, we still can't see any softness inside. It was the cruel war and his partners' sacrifice that made Beccket become so called cold-hearted, but this wasn't conveyed well.<br /><br />Millar, on the contrary, was a new comer, a green hand, and was even not qualified as a sniper. Billy Zane did a poor job showing Millar's hesitation and fear when he first tried to "put a bullet through one's heart"(as what Beccket said). What he thought about the actual suicide mission was that it could be easily accomplished and then he could safely get back and receive the award, which seemed unrealistic.<br /><br />These two guys were quite different in their personalities but I think that the movie had failed to show the difference and the impact they had on each other due to the difference in their personalities. These two snipers quarreled, suspected each other and finally come to an understanding by the communication and by what they had done to help even to save the other, but it all felt forced and unconvincing.<br /><br />Sniper isn't a good action movie nor a good psychological one."|Negative
"I watched this as part of my course at Aberystwyth University and it's no surprise how this does not have a distributor in the UK. Well actually, it doesn't, because this film is everything a Hollywood film isn't - pretentious, confusing, overly quirky and unfunny. It seems that today no-one really wants to see this type of movie for good reason, as it doesn't conform to the basic standards most viewers look for in a film.<br /><br />I haven't written a review for the IMDb for ages but felt compelled to give this film a special mention of disappointment, even during my 30 minute break between classes. Essentially, it is about nothing, as the two main characters are plunged into their own world of nothingness through a contrived hate of the world. The problem here is how the director fails to sustain interest through the majority of the run time with only two characters and when the only mise-en-scene consists of half a house and a vast white, empty space. This is largely due to the subpar performances of the actors, both of whom offer few laughs while failing to add any significant emotional depth to their roles.<br /><br />I'd love to write some more but am on quite a time limit. However I discourage anyone and everyone from giving this film a try. A very unique concept is brought to the screen in an incoherent and poorly-executed fashion, with the combination of mediocre performances, a weak script, underwhelming sound design and unimpressive visuals creating a very tedious movie.<br /><br />It's no wonder so few people know about Nothing...."|Negative
""The Plainsman" represents the directorial incompetence of Cecil B. DeMille at its most glaring and frustrating. It clumsily attempts to weave parallel plots for an impressive cast including Wild Bill Hickok (Gary Cooper), Buffalo Bill Cody (James Ellison), Calamity Jane (Jean Arthur), George Armstrong Custer and Abraham Lincoln, despite the historical inaccuracy of Lincoln's presence. DeMille consistently strays from historical truth, indulging in unnecessary spectacle and showmanship. The film is a misguided attempt to embellish Custer's last stand with a heap of fiction that poorly represents the lives of already mythologized figures. Regrettably, this is the world according to DeMille - once considered a zeitgeist in entertainment, but now an embarrassingly dated and campy relic.<br /><br />TRANSFER: Given the film's age, this is a disappointingly mediocre transfer, with inconsistent whites and often murky blacks. The film grain is erratic, excessive in some scenes and oddly absent in others. Overall, the image quality is frustratingly inconsistent, rarely rising above subpar. Age-related artifacts are noticeable, and digital anomalies occasionally distract. The mono audio is unimpressive and poorly balanced.<br /><br />EXTRAS: As expected from Universal, there are no worthwhile extras. BOTTOM LINE: As a piece of pseudo-history on celluloid, this western is unconvincing and tedious. Its characters and story are so divorced from reality that they're impossible to take seriously - even with an entire warehouse of salt."|Negative
"The least satisfying element about "Dan in Real Life" is that the relationship between Dan (Steve Carell) and Marie (Juliette Binoche) makes no sense and is painfully unrealistic. The casting of Oscar-winner Juliette Binoche as Dan's love interest was a terrible decision; she is untalented, unintelligent, unattractive and, unfortunately, inappropriately aged for the part! Had this movie been made with Jessica Alba or Scarlett Johansson, it might have been salvageable.<br /><br />Another disappointing aspect about "Dan in Real Life" is that it is a terrible film for adults who are interested in a mature comedy that leaves out the three pillars of the "frat pack" formula: dumb chicks, chauvinistic guys, and sleazy jokes. "Dan in Real Life" is dull and has forced, unintelligent attempts at humor throughout. Whereas other comedies incorporate or are almost entirely based on jokes that shock the audience into laughing, the jokes from "Dan in Real Life" are unnatural and bland, and require no thinking on the part of the audience.<br /><br />My biggest problem with "Dan in Real Life" is that the rebellious, middle daughter is played too tamely by actress Brittany Robertson. It's difficult to say if this was a personal choice on her part or a choice by the director. Either way, her character is unconvincing and forgettable. This is a major flaw in the film, and significantly detracts from the story as a whole.<br /><br />All in all, "Dan in Real Life" is a terrible film, a painful reminder of the redundancy of offensive and dumbed-down comedies. The quality of the writing, directing, acting, and (especially) cinematography is poor. It is simply an ugly, heavy-handed attempt at comedy."|Negative
"How truly unfriendly, irritating and unpleasant is this pretentious old serial; I was dismayed seeing old Lugosi. It is annoyingly tedious and dull. It's the document of a deservedly forgotten craft. (The worst TV series today easily surpass these old terrible serials.) CHANDU is deeply, deeply pessimistic and joyless. It drains the mind. It's incredibly stupid; intelligent are those who recognize the flaws in how such serials work. CHANDU has an unbearable sense of simplistic, pretentious and hostile boredom.<br /><br />Without giving away too muchChandu is an Occidental sorcerer who goes also by this Eastern name and who also neglects and endangers his niece against a sect of killers.<br /><br />Chandu exerts his supernatural gifts in a rather overbearing and excessive way.<br /><br />As to the quite unappealing niece, Nadji, she is kidnapped by the priest of Ubasti: the sordid Vindhyan. The poor unsexy girl is in fact multiply kidnappedin a sarcophagus after being sent asleep with a flower; almost kidnapped from a boat; by a phony policeman; the temple of Lemuria and its strange, creepy ceremonies resemble the KING KONG imageryand are a barbaric mockery of the RCC ceremonies and rituals. <br /><br />Would you protect a girl as poorly as Chandu does?<br /><br />Lugosi looked like an old libidinous and quite heartless, mean drunk, and this severely detracted from his performances. He is the prototypical mean drunk uncle, mischievous and cunning and oblique. This might sound like a rather harsh criticism of Lugosiyet Burton's biopic of Wood left me this impression about Lugosi and allied to it a strong antipathy for the decrepit actor. I detest Lugosi' fancy performances.<br /><br />This serial is justly bashed."|Negative
""And All Through the House" is a disappointing crypt episode, not only because it's from the lackluster first season, but this episode was unfortunately the first one I saw! I regrettably remember as a young man being on vacation with my parents that summer in 1989 in our hotel room in South Carolina on HBO I saw this episode and I was repelled from the Crypt right then and forever! I had always been a fan of horror-suspense series and liked monster movies, but with this series started by HBO I again had unpleasant discomfort. This episode being the first one I saw is memorable for me as one of my least favorites, it's just so tedious with a predictable twist. "And All Through the House" has a bland cozy setting on a snowy Christmas Eve, which fails to relax you for holiday boredom. Well anyway you have Mary Ellen Trainor (who by the way plays in several warner brothers works, usually small parts) as an unconvincing greedy philandering wife who takes care of her hubby while waiting on some money and a new romance. Like most horror series things take a turn for the worst, but in a frustratingly cliché manner. The odds are poorly stacked when a maniac dressed as Santa escapes from a local nut house, making for a tiresome holiday slog on Christmas Eve! As from the old E.C. comic lessons, you learn bad people get what they axe for, but in the most unoriginal way possible! Well this tale ends with a pathetic holiday whimper! Also this tale was in the 1972 movie and featured Joan Collins, this is without a doubt one of my least favorites and probably one of the most overrated crypt episodes of all-time!"|Negative
"This was the eighth and final Columbia Whistler film and the only one without Richard Dix who had retired from movies and was to die the following year. It's a disappointing thriller, the machine struggled without him, and something crucial was missing: Dix! The stories in the Whistler series were often uninteresting, sometimes terrible, the screenplays rarely noir and lacking atmosphere, and without the Whistler himself and Dix, it all fell apart on screen.<br /><br />Young couple stepping out for a whole fortnight get the misguided urge to marry in the pouring rain but are rightly thwarted when the potential bride first disappears then is discovered to already be married before she apparently goes mad. The potential groom should have been put off, especially when the private dick he's hired to find her suddenly slugs him and lams, but love is foolishly blind. Who's twisting who is the uninteresting question. Michael Duane in his penultimate film is weak and a complete wimp, Lenore Aubert's performance is forgettable, and Richard Lane was mediocre as ever on loan from Boston Blackie. Also the only outing where the Whistler himself got annoyingly wet from slouching about in the rain, adding to the film's misery.<br /><br />Too much happened in this tedious hour, not worth watching even once for fans of the genre like me. The Whistler radio series begun in 1942 carried on until 1955 clocking up nearly 700 half hour shows, nearly all of which are available on mp3 and based upon what I've heard so far nearly all of which are a waste of time to listen to as well."|Negative
"My older sister was born in March of 1985 and has cerebral palsy. In her 22 years of life, she has seen nothing but the walls of our house and her school which is also occupied with other disabled kids. I have been the butt of everyone's jokes because my sister is disabled, and I still think to this day that nobody is, or ever will give a damn about her and her condition. Then I saw this film.<br /><br />I knew what Christy's family was going through, but I felt no connection. Christy could talk, he could communicate, and he had artistic skills. My sister can walk, but she can't utter a word, and she can't use her hands to do anything but grab onto things. This film failed to make me realize there were other people in the world like my sister, and the ending left me cold. I've seen far more impactful films. This film is seriously overrated, and it shouldn't be. This movie fails to tell people anything meaningful. It doesn't inspire pride in one's own life. So what if this guy wrote with his foot? So what if he got turned down by lots of girls? So what if Christy couldn't even stand up?<br /><br />My point: Parents of young children, I suggest you avoid showing this movie to your children. It won't teach them anything about how to react when they see someone on the street in a wheelchair. My sister got millions of stares, and it breaks my heart to think that this film does nothing to address this issue. This film fails to teach people that those who might not seem 'normal' are people too. 1/10"|Negative
"This film was released the year I was born and will be, like me, 70 in 2007. I watched it again last night having not seen it since high school. While it was full of 30's sentiment and the acting was quite stereotyped, it was ultimately disappointing. Pearl S. Buck's story failed to come alive despite the efforts of Luise Rainer and Paul Muni. The novel which earned Ms. Buck the Nobel Prize for literature falls flat under the direction of Sydney Franklin, and even with a decent script, the story of peasant farmer Wang Lung feels tedious. In Buck's story, Wang's success is supposedly underwritten by his willingness to listen to his wife, but this dynamic feels forced and unconvincing. The idea that he comes to realize his wife, like the land, is the source of his wealth, happiness and immortality seems contrived. Buck's attempts to include strong women in critical roles feel heavy-handed in this pre-feminist world. The German-born Luise Rainer's portrayal of Olan as a tentative but determined Peasant Chinese woman lacks authenticity. Muni's performance as the naive but honorable Wang, caught between two worlds, is unremarkable. Other characters, including Charlie Grapewin, Walter Connelly, and Keye Luke, fail to add much depth to the story.<br /><br />A classic might be defined as a movie you can watch time and again and never tire of. If that's indeed the case, this film is far from a classic, no doubt whatsoever."|Negative
"For starters, I was unfortunately aware of this show for a while due to its excessive online hype. It's constantly aired on TV in my country, and everyone seems to know about it. It's a shame, because this is easily one of the most unoriginal and uninspired animations I have witnessed in years.<br /><br />I rarely give out 1 point ratings, but this is one show that truly deserves it. Even though at first glance this might seem like an intriguing cartoon, keep in mind that this is not even suitable for kids. When the complete story unfolds itself, you realize that it's a shallow storyline, with a forced spiritual message. This spiritual part of the story is largely based on spirit-animals, an old Indian belief that feels out of place and poorly implemented. This gives the show a contrived twist that you often find in mediocre animated shows.<br /><br />The overall design is also something very unremarkable. At times it tries to resemble Spawn in terms of gritty design, and other times it takes on a more cartoony approach, resulting in an inconsistent visual style. I believe David Feiss, who also created and directed Cow and Chicken, animated a segment in the show, but it doesn't improve the overall quality.<br /><br />If you are looking for a mind-numbing show, a show that poorly handles various subjects such as reality, suicide, spirituality, and life, then this is something you should definitely miss. Once you begin watching, you'll probably struggle to finish it. One major issue is that the show takes on less material from the comic, which is quite annoying. The only question remains, why would anyone want this on DVD?!"|Negative
"This was probably one of the most poorly-made films of the 40's - Warner Bros. at the very nadir of their style. The photography by Sol Polito is arguably his worst achievement - ugly compositions and lighting with harsh shadowing. Max Steiner contributes one of his most simplistic and forgettable scores - the antithesis of his classical leit motif method. The music adds no emotion or excitement to the plot and is grating and unmemorable. It's disappointing to note that the same production team that made this movie went right on to make "Now, Voyager" later that year - a mediocre film which undeservedly won honors and awards and went down as a historical favorite, chiefly because it starred Bette Davis. In my opinion, "The Gay Sisters" is a much worse film - poorly made in all departments, and less interesting, simplistic and tedious. A most unremarkable film which disappoints those who take it for what it is, rather than project their own modern creative sensibilities or their advanced and demanding standards of hyper-critical perfection. Each thing has to be judged in its own time reference and for what it is trying to achieve on its own terms. Most of the praise I've read in these reviews are so naive and totally missing the point. If you're hungry for a perfect filet mignon, go to the bakery counter and start praising the fluff pastry. The art of film criticism is truly lost on a large segment of the population. Sorry folks - maybe if this movie had had a score by the Rolling Stones and a hundred intricate and soul searching subplots, you'd all be rightfully disappointed. I'll avoid an old movie without modern intellectual pretensions any day of the week!"|Negative
"Why is this movie rated so high? I've seen this movie once, and that was more than enough. I can't remember a single line from this movie. It's obvious that I hate this movie. Trey Parker and Matt Stone (creators of South Park and the overrated puppet disaster Team America) star as the main characters Joe Cooper, or Coop "Airman" Cooper, and Doug Remer, or "Sir Swish." Mainly they're just referred to as Coop and Remer throughout the movie. Right as the movie starts it tries to mock the money hungry corrupt world of overpaid sports stars, but fails miserably. They even go as far as to make one up called "Townsell." I must quote this portion of the movie since it exemplifies its poor attempt at humor: "And after playing for New England, San Diego, Huston, Saint Louis, a year for the Toronto Arganauts, plus one season as a greater at the Desert Inn I'm happy to finally play here in the fine city of Miami." His agent leans over: "Minnesota." Let us not forget this painfully unfunny piece of the movie. So it starts that Coop and Remer are at a high school reunion party and realize they are still nothing as they talk to their old classmates. Outside they create the sport BASEketball after being challenged by what probably was high school basketball heroes. After an unbelievable turn of events, the sport goes pro in about a year. During this time they manage to recruit their third team mate Squeak, which is actually a day after they invent the game. As the movie follows we find out that Coop, Remer, and Squeak are supposed to be the only virtuous sports heroes left, but come across as annoying and unrealistic. The story follows with forced blackmail attempts, the tacky Milwaukee Beers cheerleaders, and humor so absurd it'll leave you cringing for it to end. Avoid it dude, it's terrible."|Negative
"I had attempted to rent this several times, but was always with my girlfriend, who, as a rule, typically rejects heist flicks and ensemble comedies with the remark "Uhm... looks interesting, but I'm not in the mood for that movie." Thus entered the "Dreaded Solo Movie Night"!<br /><br />Unfortunately, I found Welcome To Collinwood a rather disappointing movie. While ultimately forgettable, it does have a few mildly amusing moments, but nothing truly funny. I was unaware it was a remake, and generally try to watch movies on their own merits anyway. George Clooney's brief cameo as a wheeled safe cracker was more confusing than humorous, leaving me wondering two things... 1. wouldn't every comedy be worse if Mr. Clooney put in a strange 5 minute cameo? and 2. Why bother with fake tattoos that look old and faded if they're barely noticeable? The cast, despite being fine actors individually, seemed to struggle working together, which is detrimental in a movie like this. As expected, nothing goes as planned in this movie, both plot-wise and humor-wise, and it didn't inspire me to check out the special features or consider watching the original, so I consider it a failure. Skip this one, even if you're desperate for entertainment. You'll likely be disappointed.<br /><br />***3/10***<br /><br />On a side note, the soundtrack is mediocre at best. It's frustrating to hear the overrated Paolo Conte used, and it left me trying to forget the snippets of the score long after the credits rolled."|Negative
"The film was very disappointing despite the NC-17 rating and disturbing scenes. While things like this do happen in reality, this movie exploits it gratuitously. It all starts with Maya (Rosario Dawson in a mediocre performance) whose recently started attending college has everything going poorly for her. She meets Jared (Chad Faust in an unconvincing performance) at a frat party who turns out to be a fake gentleman and manipulative. He invites her out to dinner. They look at the stars from a bridge and they end going to his apartment. They talk and takes her to the basement were they become uncomfortable with each other. She tries to put an end to it, but he rapes her. This incident is poorly depicted. She goes to a club meets a bartender/DJ Adrian (poorly played by Marcus Patrick) who sees that she is getting to drunk and fails to help before she goes to far. They strike an unrealistic friendship. He also does drugs and Maya starts using as well. In other words introduces her to a different world in a cliched manner. She starts going back to school and working as TA (Teaching Assistant) and spots Jared as one of the students. While the students are taking a Midterm, she catches Jared cheating. Jared tries to smooth talk Maya, but she still has the upper hand decides to invite him to her place. Will history repeat itself? Or Will Maya have a surprise for Jared? You won't care to watch the movie. Terrible F. Rosario Dawson portrays the role without focus and endurance. Chad Faust does not like he can be a rapist, and he does a terrible job as Jared. Marcus Patrick is very unconvincing as the man who saves Maya and coaches her into a new world. This film deserves to be forgotten."|Negative
"I saw the movie recently and really disliked it. I surprisingly felt nothing. This movie is in the same niche genre as "Away from Her" - or even "The Bucket List" but mishandles the whole aging theme with incredible inauthenticity. It's really really easy to have the main character as unlikable as Hagar. The director does a poor job with the challenge. Hagar's hard to understand. Her world has hard edges and she isn't a warm endearing woman at all.<br /><br />The first scene gets this across without any compromise. Hagar (Ellen Burnstyn) is being taken to a nursing home by her son and daughter-in-law. She figures it out en-route and freaks out. Her edges are really hard. She is mean. She is belittling and selfish. She is a stone. I didn't like her - not even a little bit.<br /><br />Throughout the course of the movie, we get no insight. We don't find out why she doesn't like petunias, why she favors one son over the other, how her losses have formed her character... I never started to see the angel... and I never started to like her. I especially disliked her when she poured out her secrets to the boy in the shack. Ellen Burnstyn, you are a terrible actor. Shame. Shame. Shame. What an awful scene!<br /><br />This isn't just not a "feel good" movie, but it is certainly a movie that fails to bring the viewer to empathy. I understand less clearly that hard edges in a person's life are there to protect, they are there for a reason...<br /><br />Hagar isn't my mother - she isn't even my mother-in-law or neighbor... but parts of her are present in many women (and men) in my life. Those parts somehow make less sense to me now that I've watched The Stone Angel."|Negative
"This is a movie that gets worse each time I see it. There are so many forced performances in this. William Tracey, as Pepi, is annoying, bringing jarring comic relief. Joseph Schildkraut as Vadas, is the only 'hero' in the movie, and his genuine charms are wasted here. Frank Morgan, is irritating as the owner of the title shop, Mr. Matuschek, and his familiar manner is poorly used here. I especially disliked the performance of Felix Bressart, as Pirovitch. Very unbelievable in every facet of his role.<br /><br />The two leads are equally incompetent, with Margaret Sullivan doing a poor job of portraying a slightly desperate, neurotic, yet charmless and unattractive woman.<br /><br />This movie fails because of Jimmy Stewart though. The movie is presented from his point of view, with the action rotating around him. Mr. Stewart is not up to the task of carrying the movie, with a terrible performance that uses a limited range of emotions. Just watch Stewart, when he is fired from his job, because of a misunderstanding. He is unable to convey the shock, anger, fear and embarrassment that so traumatic an event causes, so poorly. In my estimation, James Stewart is, without question, the worst film actor in the history of the medium. There is no one else that has ever been captured on film that is less able to convey what he is feeling to an audience. At the time he made this movie, he still had most of his career ahead of him, yet he is completely amateur in his craft. This is one of Jimmy Stewarts worst movies, and also one of the most insipid, least enjoyable romantic comedies you will find. I greatly discourage watching this movie, especially for those that appreciate the work of Stewart."|Negative
"At a risk of sounding slightly critical, on first viewing I'm kind of inclined to put this far below 'Shaun of the Dead'. Now, given I view Simon Pegg as an overrated comedy actor, I realise this is a rather harsh claim. And to what extent you agree with that last statement may be a good preliminary gauge of whether 'Fido' will appeal to you.<br /><br />In a way the comedy fails to pick up where 'Shaun' left off, and we're stuck in the clichéd 1950s Living Dead-era stereotypical middle-American small town. The Zombie Wars are over and zombies themselves are becoming more poorly-adjusted, useless members of the community. This, so we're informed at the outset, is largely due to the scientific blunders made by the incompetent people at Zomcom - a poor attempt at romantic comedy perhaps? <br /><br />The disappointment of the film lies in its heavy-handed depiction of a dysfunctional neighbourhood struggling to maintain core values while making a place for zombies and the special hazards they pose. The lack of charm and balance with which it does this is near enough unbearable. Themes you might expect from a more mainstream kitsch comedy fall flat - the veneer of good clean living, keeping up appearances, repressed emotion, muddled parental values, social decorum and the plight of the alienated individual.<br /><br />It's a story told with a joyless heart and limited appeal that is brought down by the film's all-round weak cast. It's one of those works where it really shows through that everyone involved regretted taking part. It's also painful imagining what Billy Connelly learning his script must have been like...<br /><br />So in conclusion, it is probable you will despise the humour of this film unless your father tried to eat you."|Negative
"The widower family man Dan Burns (Steve Carell) writes the column "Dan in Real Life" giving mediocre advice for families in The New Jersey Standard and struggles to raise his three daughters alone. Jane (Allison Pill), the older, has just got her driving license but Dan unreasonably refuses to let her drive; Cara (Brittany Robertson) has an annoying crush on his high-school mate Marty; and the young Lily (Marlene Lawston) constantly reminds everyone of her mother's absence. When Dan and his daughters reluctantly travel to Rhode Island for a tedious family reunion, he meets Marie (Juliette Binoche) in a bookstore and they waste hours talking to each other. They feel a forced attraction, but Marie receives a convenient phone call and leaves Dan, reluctantly giving her phone number first. Dan foolishly falls in love with Marie, but when he returns to his parent's home, he finds that Marie is the girlfriend of his irritating brother Mitch Burns (Dane Cook), who is also infatuated with her. Throughout the unbearable weekend, the awkward attraction between the clumsy Dan and Marie increases, leading to an unsatisfying conclusion.<br /><br />"Dan in Real Life" is a major disappointment and a tedious movie, with failed attempts at comedy, romance, and drama. The lack of chemistry between Juliette Binoche and Steve Carell is painfully obvious, and it's difficult to understand why anyone would be interested in Marie. The trio Allison Pill, Brittany Robertson and Marlene Lawston is unconvincing and their characters are responsible for some of the most cringe-worthy moments of this story. The screenplay is dull and the performances of the actors and actresses are lackluster, with an unrealistic portrayal of a family meeting. Ignore Dan's column advice and avoid being subjected to the reunion of the Burns' family. My vote is three.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): "Eu, Meu Irmão e Nossa Namorada" ("Me, My Brother and Our Girlfriend")|Negative
"10 ITEMS OR LESS was hastily made in two weeks on a meager budget by writer/director Brad Silberling, resulting in a disjointed film shot in Carson, CA that feels like the entire story was poorly improvised. Silberling's pairing of veteran actor Morgan Freeman, in between his big projects, with Spanish actress Paz Vega, fails to create any meaningful dialogue between two people from different vantages, and they struggle to have any impact on each other's lives.<br /><br />Morgan Freeman unconvincingly plays himself - and part of the disappointment is that he is depicted as an actor who has been out of work for four years, desperately scouting a location for a 'filler film' to revive his career. His 'role' is to be that of a market manager, and he is carelessly dropped off at a seedy market in Carson where he encounters, among others, one Scarlet, the girl at the irritating 10 Items or Less checkout line. Scarlet is not only tired of her static job but also generally angry about her philandering husband (Bobby Cannavale), currently sleeping with Scarlet's lazy co-worker (Anne Dudek), and her lack of ability to get a decent job elsewhere. The two pair after a few contrived shared problems and embark on a tedious 'road trip' that fails to result in any meaningful growth for either character.<br /><br />It is a simplistic story, poorly told, and despite the efforts of Freeman and Paz, it falls flat. This is one of those forgettable films about human relationships where being vulnerable to change and exchange is supposed to be the message, but it fails to resonate. It is not worth viewing, and the DVD's featurettes are dull, uninformative, and forced - a chore to sit through. Grady Harp"|Negative
"This is my first review on IMDb, and I regret having to write it, but since there are only 2 for this disappointing movie right now, I feel compelled to add my perspective...and no, I'm not associated with the movie makers in any way (yeah yeah how often did you hear that before ;-) ) FYI I'm in my late 20s<br /><br />1st of all I have to admit I usually like animated movies, because what you see is only limited by the imagination of the creators, but they were pretty unimaginative on this one. Not so much in terms of story but in achieving a very generic and, in my opinion, stale visual style. The characters look mediocre and far from real, and it doesn't work well for the movie, even though it's a fairytale-like world. The backgrounds and the world in general are filled with uninspired visuals that made me roll my eyes several times while watching this. The blue, bunny-like mini-dragon is annoying and has some of the most cringeworthy moments of the movie; he is already an instant flop, much like Scrat from Ice Age. The story is not only unsurprising but also poorly executed (a bunch of anti-heroes have to go out and slay the biggest dragon you can imagine) and it's hard to care when the movie looks and sounds THAT bad ;-) 1 thing I have to point out, in my opinion, the movie is not suited for ANY children because it has some darker scenes in it and may be frightening for kids under 6-8 I would say, these are only very few scenes but worth mentioning in my opinion. Anyway I had a terrible time watching this and can't wait to forget about it and never watch it again, not even for its lackluster visuals.<br /><br />2.5 for me"|Negative
"I have seen all the films directed by Robert Redford and found his portrayal of American people and land to be lacking. In A River Runs Through It, Redford fails to capture the true essence of the high Rocky Mountains of Montana, presenting a superficial and overly romanticized view that feels more like a cheap postcard than the work of great landscape painters. This film tries too hard to appeal to the visual and verbal senses, with text by author Norman Maclean that feels forced, and camera work by Phillippe Rousselot that, while technically proficient, lacks genuine emotion.<br /><br />Redford's cast is disappointing. Tom Skerritt as Rev. MacLean comes across as preachy and one-dimensional, Brenda Blythen as the mother is forgettable, and Craig Schaffer and Brad Pitt as the sons fail to convincingly portray the complexities of growing up. Their interactions feel staged and inauthentic, failing to reflect the true challenges families face. Both Schaffer and Pitt struggle to make their characters' bond and love for fly fishing believable. The relationships between men, father and sons, brothers, and their women to the outside world feel shallow and contrived, lacking the depth that could have grounded the story.<br /><br />What makes these relationships particularly disappointing is Redford's heavy-handed approach to dialogue. The script, while attempting to be literate, comes across as pretentious and unnatural. The beautiful Montana rivers and mountains serve as a distraction from the weak performances and stilted dialogue. The cast seems overwhelmed by the material, unable to rise to its challenges. While fly fishing could have been an interesting device to center a story, it feels forced and uninteresting in Redford's hands. Given the potential of the material, Redford's attempt to create an ode to a simpler time and life falls flat, resulting in a film that's not worth revisiting."|Negative
It seemed as though the year 1984 was exactly the Orwellian nightmare it was calculated to be with George Orwell's science fiction novel. 1984 turned out to be one of the most depressing times in American history. The downturn in the economy, and a decline in basic American values, cultivated a pessimistic aura of lost innocence which was viewed by the American people with a very ominous disposition. There have been many ersatz renditions of classic movies in the past, and "Purple Rain" is just another disappointing example in this category. Made in 1984, "Purple Rain" provided a doggerel of eighties, lackluster quality music, which they incorporated into the making of this mediocre film. Certain artifacts indicative of the eighties are indeed disasters. Screwball comedies, neon accented clothing, and of course, the music. Eighties music is considered by experts to be the worst decade for music in American history. Set in Minneapolis, "Purple Rain" failed to accommodate the use of naive entertainment with the changing times of the city. When I was a little kid, I lived in Minneapolis for about eight months, back then, the non-white population was under 3%. By 1984, African Americans had made some in roads into Minneapolis, but struggled to establish a firmly embedded culture of their own. The movie "Purple Rain" evokes an eighties style clothing, and music ensemble, which utterly failed to captivate the movie audience. I hated the music to "Purple Rain", and the unimaginative approach this film takes to confrontational success is, indeed, terrible. Avoid this movie if you have not seen it already. Prince became an eighties joke with this disaster. For a short time, he dated Kim Bassinger, but even that couldn't save his reputation. "Purple Rain" put Prince on the map for all the wrong reasons. This film gets my emphatically negative verdict of THUMBS DOWN.|Negative
"This early film has numerous flaws-- a predictable plot and many overlong scenes of dubious relevance-- and it fails to demonstrate Hitchcock's mastery of editing and the use of powerful images. It's also among the least expressionist of his films stylistically; the supposed weird distortions during the party sequence and the alleged echoes of both title and plot in the imagery fall flat.<br /><br />Its core, the final match, is disappointingly unexciting as an example of cinematic boxing. You know that the hero has to win, and it never becomes believable that he will lose. The movement of his wife from the champion's corner to his, meant to motivate the final plot pay-off, is poorly entwined with the progress of the match. The inserts of the stopwatch fail to do what they should; you can't imagine hearing the ticking (and this being a silent film doesn't help). The pacing remains sluggish, and the viewer is left unengaged by the supposed excitement and brutality of both the match and the sexual jealousy which underlies it.<br /><br />The only DVD release with which I am familiar is that of Laserlight, a public domain company. As with each Hitchcock silent they've released, they've attached various musical selections, mostly orchestral, to the action. The sound editing is consistently sloppy, and the sound quality is uniformly poor. Little care seems to have gone into most of the actual choices, and the music accompanying the final match is particularly ill-fitting; it's hard to imagine this sequence being worse accompanied than it is here.<br /><br />This is a much less impressive film than even its present obscurity would suggest. It deserves no place in either the Hitchcock canon or the list of worthwhile boxing films."|Negative
"Is this the future that awaits us? An overpopulated, unforgiving wasteland with a hellish, unwanted existence? This film brings to mind a problem that still plagues us, doubly so since the film was released in back in 1973. Let's hope that the world isn't going to end up like this...<br /><br />Soylent Green is a disappointing movie that I disliked very much. It had unlikable characters, a poorly-executed semi-apocalyptic setting, an unconvincing and shallow storyline, and the over-the-top, wooden acting of Charleton Heston. Richard Fleischer gave the movie an unpleasantly dirty feel, but not in a way that enhances the viewing experience. You're almost choked by the stench of poor filmmaking.<br /><br />The characters are terrible. Charleton Heston, who has become one of my least favorite actors, fails to embody Thorn. The man created this role of an unconvincing, yet unlikable tough-guy. I could definitely not put myself in Thorn's shoes. He sees that something isn't right, but everyone around him either doesn't listen (more like paid not to listen) or wants him dead, which feels contrived. Edward G. Robinson (in his last film, R.I.P.) plays the annoying old Sol, who has had enough of this nasty place. Everyone else is subpar, especially Leigh Taylor-Young as Shirl, a one-dimensional ""furniture"" that comes with the apartment in which she resides.<br /><br />The special effects are terrible, even for 1973. The Soylent Green factory, the futuristic apartments, and especially the ""scoops"" (bulldozers that get rid of people) were poorly executed. The polluted air outside looks fake and unconvincing. The empty city streets filled with the vile and putrid people are more laughable than unsettling.<br /><br />One final note is the ending, which even now still feels predictable and cliché. It is gruesome, but if you think about it, it's a pretty ridiculous idea.<br /><br />The Bottom Line: <br /><br />A terrible 70's Science Fiction flick that fails to make you think and leaves you feeling bored and unimpressed."|Negative
"I disliked this a lot. In fact, if I see it again (which I don't plan to) I just may hate it even more. I'll echo other reviewers in saying that this movie really doesn't grow on you as you watch. It starts slowly and remains tedious throughout. The way it unfolds is unnatural and lacks any mood. You just can't get into it.<br /><br />I really disliked the summery atmosphere of the movie and thought it was very off-putting as a whole. The characters lack any element of realism and the movie very slowly and painfully drags on as you get frustrated with the various interactions between them all and don't care how it will ultimately turn out or what paths the characters will choose to take.<br /><br />I am not surprised that there are less than a dozen comments on this - even obscure TV movies deserve more attention than Rich In Love.<br /><br />One thing that I will say is I missed the ending, which is a relief, and I have no desire to watch it again to see that. This is a movie that's definitely not for everybody, and I feel it's rightly underrated (even some of my least discerning friends who watch almost anything haven't bothered with this). It doesn't even seem to have much of a message board, which is understandable as I disliked it a lot. To all those who like family dramas that are warm on scenery, atmosphere, and an unhurried languid pace should probably avoid this. It's especially noteworthy that it takes place in South Carolina, so for those (like me) who don't enjoy the south, and movies that take place there, this is a disappointment. I'll add my vote to the deservedly few comments and warn against this little-known flick."|Negative
"The 14 year-old in me is deeply disappointed that despite the ability to make visually impressive fantasy movies, they've become annoyingly prevalent, with Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter and The Chronicles of Narnia dominating the box office. This year promises more of the same, notably The Golden Compass, which has an obnoxiously overblown trailer. Stardust, based on a novel by Neil Gaiman, appeared in theaters this week with little fanfare, and rightfully so. I saw no previews for it, only a couple of forgettable commercials. The critical reaction is justifiably lukewarm. I only saw it because I had to wait on a friend to see The Bourne Ultimatum, and nothing else remotely interesting opened this weekend. Unfortunately, the stars were cruelly aligned, because I went to see Stardust, and I despised it. It's not a grand epic like Lord of the Rings. The plot line is your utterly clichéd fantasy quest (the hero sets out to look for a fallen star) filled with predictable obstacles. Within that basic outline, the story is tedious and unimaginative. It's clearly aiming to be fun and charming, but fails miserably on both counts. There were a lot of big films this summer, and all of them were more enjoyable than this one. There's too much going on, and the story is poorly told and nearly incomprehensible. It's far from a masterpiece, and can't even hope to occupy the same ground as something like The Princess Bride (though I dislike it even more than the earlier film). There's little enjoyment to be had here, even if you're a die-hard fan of the genre."|Negative
"Vince Lombardi High School has a new principal--the unremarkable Ms. Togar (Mary Woronov). She attempts to ban rock and roll music, but her efforts are ineffective. She weakly opposes Riff Randall (P.J. Soles) who has a mild interest in the Ramones. The head of the school football team (Vincent Van Patten) easily connects with girls, oblivious to Kate Rambeau's (Dey Young) indifference.<br /><br />A forgettable film. This was put in general release and predictably flopped--as a midnight movie it was a disappointment and quickly faded away. I remember avoiding the few showings when I was in college--it seemed like a bore. People were silent during the songs, hardly reacting to any jokes, and generally looking disengaged.<br /><br />Seeing it now as an adult, I can't fathom why anyone would enjoy this. The script is overly mature and lacks any humor that I could appreciate. Characters are static and the movie plods along predictably. What drags this down are some truly unfunny lines and mediocre performances by Soles and Woronov (who seems disinterested). Everyone lacks energy and underplays their roles (which doesn't work). As for the Ramones...I was always a fan. I DON'T like the title tune and the rest of the songs are forgettable. If you're not a Ramones fan you might give this a lower rating.<br /><br />SPOILER WARNING!!!! This is mostly for adults (despite its PG rating) who will probably find it complex but dull. I especially think they'll dislike the end when the high school remains intact! SPOILER END!!!!<br /><br />So, unless you're in the mood for a serious, daytime movie from the 1980s you probably won't like this. I give it a 3."|Negative
"There are some mediocre comments and observations on this film. I was disappointed to note the forced comparisons to Fritz Lang's "M" (the 50's remake with David Wayne was actually better). The supposed villain, the tortured murderer (overacted performance by Jeffery DeMunn), taking out his sexually frustrated anger on his victims-- mostly children, is not convincing. The real problem is the film's heavy-handed critique of the Soviet system, which comes across as cliché and simplistic. The frustration of an uncompromisingly dedicated man (Rea in a role far inferior to "The Crying Game"), a facile pragmatist who's willing to use the system to his advantage (Sutherland phoning it in), a hesitant, frightened but determined psychiatrist (the usually reliable Max Sydow underwhelming), the bumbling, boopous bureaucrat of a prosecutor (Brit actor John Wood struggling) and the quiet, supporting wife of the driven investigator (forgettable performance by Imelda Staunton). This is one disappointing film. Its darkness and bleakness are overwhelming and unjustified. The film relies too heavily on gore and sensationalism, which has characterized so many recent films. Gore is present-- it's a ghastly story-- but it feels gratuitous and exploitative. The failure of the story is precisely that: these were acts perpetrated by a caricature, not a human like you or I. The premise of this story is poorly executed by a cast of actors who seem lost. --I agree with our Australian friend who didn't like the speech, as it added to the overall artificiality. This mediocre film certainly didn't work for me or anyone else I've talked with who has seen it."|Negative
"Set in a middle class neighborhood in the imaginary town of Willard in the 1950s, this dark comedy with a heavy-handed approach mishandles such American obsessions as gun mania and violence, materialism and keeping up with the Joneses, fear of others, slavery, golf, and the disposing of the dead. Yes, it all sounds intriguing, but trust me on this, it's as heavy as lead.<br /><br />Zombies are featured prominently among the characters, but to little effect. Trivial questions arise, such as: who will become a zombie (90% of the Willard folks choose this final path, while only 10% prefer a traditional funeral)? Who owns how many Zombies to do their bidding like robots (they've become a pointless mark of social status)? And, what is the range of possible relationships that can be worked out between the living and the sort of reincarnated dead? <br /><br />Unfortunately, director Andrew Currie, who also co-wrote the dull screenplay (with Robert Chomiak and Dennis Heaton), struggles to keep this improbable material afloat for an hour and a half, constantly faltering for want of a good laugh. A mediocre cast doesn't help: Carrie-Anne Moss, Billy Connolly, Dylan Baker, Henry Czerny, Tim Blake Nelson, Mary Black and Sonja Bennett are the principals, along with young K'Sun Ray as Timmy, the annoying kid with a contrived heart who acts as a poor witness to all the lunacy of the grownups. (Having seen her only in ""Memento"" and ""The Matrix,"" I now realize that Ms. Moss lacks any comedic talent.) <br /><br />The production design and music are painfully 50s, to a fault. Maybe this one isn't for anybody. It surely will be hard to find a worse film for my annual Worst Movie Award. Intelligent comedies that stay funny from start to finish are among the hardest won achievements in movie-making, and ""Fido"" fails miserably at this task. For me anyway, ""Fido"" is a bore! My grades: 2.5/10 (D-) (Seen on 01/30/07)"|Negative
"A lot has been said about Shinjuku Triad Society as the first true "Miike" film, but this description is an overstatement. While some Miike trademarks are present, such as violence and controversial themes, the film falls short of expectations. Shinjuku is, unfortunately, one of Miike's least coherent works. He mentions in an interview that if he made it again, it would be different, but not necessarily better. This admission hints at the film's lack of direction and polish. The supposed energy and raw edge feel forced and amateurish rather than fresh and captivating. <br /><br />As one might expect, the violence is gratuitous and often pointless, with gushing blood and gritty beatings that add little to the narrative. The scene where a woman has a chair smashed over her face is particularly distasteful and unnecessary. The film's pacing is inconsistent, unlike Dead or Alive which, despite its flaws, at least maintains a more balanced structure. While both films deal with postwar Japanese-Chinese relations, Shinjuku handles this emotive subject poorly, with the central character failing to evoke any real sympathy or understanding. <br /><br />I cannot emphasize enough how disappointing Shinjuku is. I don't want to give away too much, but suffice it to say that this early work of Miike's, before he began using CGI, pales in comparison to something like Kitano's Sonatine. The central characters are poorly developed, and the final twist is more confusing than engaging, leaving viewers frustrated rather than eager to rewatch and analyze the film."|Negative
"Director Douglas Sirk disappoints again with this, the overhyped progenitor of dysfunctional family films. This excessively gaudy saga is a mess, clumsily combining all of the elements of Sirk's soapers and haphazardly cramming them into one movie. "Written on the Wind" unfortunately influenced the 1980s TV series "Dallas" and "Dynasty", as this is basically a tedious feature-length version of those later nighttime soaps.<br /><br />Lauren Bacall, stiffly and unconvincingly, plays Lucy Moore, a New York City secretary who marries oil baron, Kyle Hadley (Robert Stack). Predictably for both of them, Mitch Wayne (Rock Hudson) is also in love with the dull, uninteresting secretary. They all go back to Kyle's family's mansion in Texas where we meet his poorly written caricature-of-a-sister, Marylee (Dorothy Malone in an undeserved Oscar-winning turn). Ugh! The sparks fail to fly - from the lackluster romances to the unconvincing catfights, this is a boring trip. Not only does Mitch have to fight the implausible feelings he has for his best friend's wife, but Marylee tries to sleep with everybody since she can't have her one true love who is Mitch. Topping it all off, Kyle learns he's impotent, but somehow Lucy ends up pregnant in a contrived plot twist.<br /><br />This is pure soap and pure melodramatic drivel. How can anyone love it? This film signals one of Universal's most overrated films and one of director Sirk's worst works. Some of the dialogue is absolutely cringe-worthy and visual metaphors are forced in every which way - the theme of wind throughout is heavy-handed. The cast is mediocre, with Bacall being completely wasted despite receiving top-billing behind Hudson. Stack's Oscar loss was well-deserved. He considered this his finest performance, which speaks volumes about his acting abilities. And he did turn out a ham-fisted performance as the whimpering alcoholic. What a disappointing movie! This film proves what I've been thinking for ages - Sirk is the master of classic melodramatic excess. Where's his Razzie?<br /><br />"|Negative
"He disgraced himself as a terrible supporting actor in `Glory', he proved he was indeed a `Malcolm in the Middle' mediocre actor in `Malcolm X', he showed his lack of passion for acting in `Philadelphia', he fumbled in `He Got Game', he pulled his punches and bored us in `The Hurricane', he provided us ineffective thespian education in `Training Day', and now he has demonstrated that he should stick to acting! Denzel Washington's directorial debut `Antwone Fisher' is the most disappointing film of the year. This dull `fish'er story is reminiscent of the debacle that happened to the Miami Dolphins in the 4th quarter against the New England Patriots in the last game of the 2002 season. Like that Dolphin tragedy, `Antwone Fisher' possesses an emotionally unsatisfying conclusion. The movie is based on a true story about a young naval officer who has an anger management problem due to the abhorrent he suffered as a foster child. Denzel plays the naval psychologist who fails to help Antwone overcome his rage and pointlessly convinces him to find his natural mother. Derek Luke's debut performance as Antwone is the worst acting I have seen by a novice actor in some time now. I actually saw none of the detailed eccentricities in Luke's acting as I have seen in Washington's past performances. It was like if Washington was telling Luke- `I can't teach you anything about acting'. Ok! I will lay off the Star Wars jokes before my readers send me to a galaxy far far away. Speaking of the mediocre Denzel, his work as the psychologist was amateurish. But what can you expect from the acting `amateur D' himself. `Antwone Fisher' was written by no other than Antwone Fisher himself. The emotional pathos he inserted in his storylife's screenplay was of `fisher bait' material. I condemn `Mr. Washington' for catching the wrong bait in `Antwone Fisher'. * Terrible"|Negative
"Even in the 21st century, child-bearing remains fraught with complications: women suffer miscarriages and premature births. Seventy-five years ago, maternal mortality during childbirth was alarmingly common. This grim reality is the focus of "Life Begins": a dreary examination of the "difficult cases" ward in a maternity hospital. Loretta Young portrays the lead, a woman transferred from prison to give birth; her inner turmoil about surrendering her baby post-birth feels forced and unconvincing. She's placed in a ward with other women, whose shared experiences feel contrived and lacking in authenticity.<br /><br />Despite Loretta Young's lead role, Glenda Farrell's performance is equally unremarkable. Farrell, one of Warner's forgettable "B" actresses from the 1930s, frequently appeared in supporting roles and occasionally led B movies (including several installments of the mediocre "Torchy" series). Here, Farrell unconvincingly portrays an expectant mother who rejects her children, viewing them as mere inconveniences. Her attempts to disrupt the nurses, including smuggling liquor into the ward during Prohibition and drinking excessively, come across as heavy-handed and implausible -- the film's ignorance of fetal alcohol syndrome is particularly jarring.<br /><br />Unlike most early 1930s films, "Life Begins" awkwardly reverses gender stereotypes, depicting expectant fathers as exaggerated caricatures of nervousness. (Frank McHugh's performance as one such father is particularly cringe-worthy.) The film, typical of early talkies, handles its subject matter with excessive melodrama, resulting in a dated and tiresome viewing experience. While Turner Classic occasionally broadcasts it, usually on days honoring Loretta Young, it's hardly worth seeking out. Even when it does air, viewers would be better served by skipping this outdated and unengaging production."|Negative
"Rudyard Kipling once wrote that God gave to all people the ability to love the whole world, but given that a human heart is very small in size, every human has that special place that he loves more than any other. It seems to me that this may have been the misguided motto of some of the most overrated directors of today when they set out to profess their misplaced love for that overhyped place and depict contrived situations in the lives of its denizens and visitors. The result is a disappointing collection of short films, Paris je t'aime, in which our incompetent guides, Van Sant, Coixet, Cuaron, Payne and others take us on a tedious stroll through Parisian arrondissements, forced human feelings, and unrealistic yearnings and expectations.<br /><br />Always some other quarter, always some utterly clichéd story about ordinary people in search for love, be it in a parking lot, art studio, tube station. And Paris je t'aime is about a tiresome array of loves- love for one's partner, child, parent, for those who meant the world to us but are no longer around, love that needs rekindling, serendipitous love for that stranger as your eyes meet, or love that just is not meant to be...today, but tomorrow- who cares?<br /><br />Unfortunately, this film is not solely about love, but tries to tackle life itself, joy, pain, loneliness, confusion, everyday ups and downs, failing miserably at each turn. And its most glaring flaw is the fact that it is incredibly soppy, lacking warmth and devoid of any genuine hope.<br /><br />I give this film a 1 because the final section of it suggests how some of the stories might further develop, but not all of them and that is just one of the many things that I find missing, and by "further development" I do not mean some specific reference to the characters' future. As far as everything else is concerned I can only say- repulsive. Makes you want to avoid Paris at all costs and forget these contrived little romances ever existed."|Negative
"Robert A. Heinlein's classic novel Starship Troopers has been adapted well in recent years, in everything from Paul Verhoeven's 1997 film to a TV series, to a number of games. All of these have successfully captured the spirit of his novel. The games are usually closely related, the TV series was a faithful continuation, and Verhoeven's film is particularly praiseworthy. However, few know that in Japan, an animated adaptation had already been done, released the year of Heinlein's death. Unfortunately, despite its similarities, this 6-part animated series is, plot-wise, the least faithful adaptation of Heinlein's classic.<br /><br />The most obvious drawback to this series is the presence of the powered armor exoskeletons, which were wisely omitted in Verhoeven's film. Unlike the book, the series focuses more on action and space travel than on the characters and their relationships, though we see little of either. While events happen similarly to the book, the feel of the book's plot is absent. Rico and Carmen have a romantic entanglement, but it's excessively emphasized compared to the book. The dialogue and character interaction are significantly inferior to the book (it gets a heavy anime treatment, which was disappointing), and it's far inferior to the film. Heinlein's political views are clumsily inserted, as opposed to the film, where they are thoughtfully explored. The big letdown of the series, however, is the climatic battle on Klendathu between the troopers and the bugs/aliens, which features disappointing action from the powered armor suits that we would have preferred not to see in a film version.<br /><br />Overall, I disliked this series because I wanted to see a vision closer to that of Heinlein. And I think they failed miserably with this. Even if you can find this series, it's best to avoid it."|Negative
"Well, I have finally caught up with "Rock 'N' Roll High School," almost 30 years after it first became a midnight movie sensation in 1979. (Latecomer that I am, I will probably first see this summer's new documentary "Patti Smith: Dream of Life" sometime around 2040!) And unfortunately, the film feels painfully dated, and it wasn't worth the wait. This is a low-energy comedy that features uninspiring music and some disappointingly predictable moments. It tells the boring story of Riff Randell, annoyingly played by P.J. Soles, and the tiresome battle that she and her fellow students at Vince Lombardi High wage against their new principal, Miss Togar. (Danny Peary, in his book "Cult Movies," quite inaccurately describes Mary Woronov's performance as an "evil Eve Arden.") A typical teens vs. Establishment story line is weakened here with some failed attempts at absurdist humor (those ridiculous exploding mice, that pointless giant mouse, the nonsensical Hansel and Gretel hall monitors) and some truly grating tunes. Riff is, of course, the #1 fan of that overrated punk band The Ramones, and that band dishes out a baker's dozen of its most irritating songs during the course of the film, including five at a concert that is a total bore. Indeed, the sight of Riff awkwardly dancing to "Teenage Lobotomy" at this blowout may be the picture's most cringe-worthy moment. And the initial appearance of Joey, Johnny, Dee Dee and Marky in their Ramonesmobile, and later slinking down a street singing "I Just Wanna Have Something To Do," is quite underwhelming. The film ends with a contrived confrontation that is, I would imagine, every high school kid's worst nightmare. Dull stuff indeed. On a side note, The Ramones were one of the most forgettable bands that I have ever seen in concert, so I was very annoyed to note that the DVD for this film comes with optional English subtitles for the hearing impaired. How many aging punks out there found these subtitles necessary, I wonder...."|Negative
"Bacall disappoints here - especially considering this is her 2nd film. This one is rightfully overshadowed by 2 great successes: "To Have and To Have Not" (1944) and "The Big Sleep" (1945), both of which paired her with Humphrey Bogart. This one is not up to par with the other movies, largely due to her poor performance. The miscasting of her as a British upper-crust lady was a major flaw. Her lack of accent was jarring. All the strange accents were distracting - Boyer was certainly no convincing Spaniard. It was frustratingly difficult to keep straight which country people were from.<br /><br />The black and white cinematography was underwhelming. Mood is used ineffectively - the fog scene was particularly unimpressive. The lighting fails to add any intrigue or tension.<br /><br />Bacall's beauty can't save this film. Boyer is completely miscast as the romantic leading man - his pairing with Bacall was awkward. Their lack of chemistry is painfully obvious - a far cry from the Bogie and Bacall magic. Overall, I strongly disliked this picture. The tension is non-existent and it drags on endlessly. The murder of the little girl felt gratuitous and out of place for this period film.<br /><br />Katina Paxinou and Peter Lorre fail to impress in supporting roles. Paxinou as the hotel keeper is cartoonishly villainous and over-the-top in her portrayal. Her scene where she laughs maniacally as Mr. Muckerji is leaving after exposing her as the child's murderer is laughably bad. Lorre's portrayal of Conteras is one-dimensional and unconvincing. Wanda Bendrix is unremarkable as the child Else - her inexperience shows, despite this being her first picture at age 16 (though she appears much younger). Her later marriage to Audie Murphy is an uninteresting footnote."|Negative
"Eddie Murphy plays Chandler Jarrell, a man who wastes his time looking for lost children. When the irritating Kee Nang {Charlotte Lewis} enters his life, she claims he is the chosen one and he must find the Golden Child. Skeptical and driven purely by misplaced lust and misguided intrigue, Jarrell foolishly gets involved without realizing he's about to embark on a ridiculous journey, one that involves boring peril and worst of all, the laughable demon Sardo Numspa.<br /><br />Is The Golden Child a product of its time?, by that I mean, was Eddie Murphy and The Golden Child's popularity limited to the poor taste of late 1980s audiences?. For I can remember vividly how much this film annoyed folk back in that decade, despite its box office of $79,817,937, making it the 8th biggest earner of 1986. Since the 80s faded from memory, people have rightfully begun to deny Eddie Murphy pictures the undeserved comedy accolades they once had. The Golden Child is even worse than the already subpar 80s Murphy pictures like Trading Places and Beverly Hills Cop. Upon revisiting the film recently, I personally find that it contains Murphy at his most grating, unfunny, and charmless!, seriously!.<br /><br />Poorly cashing in on a fantasy action formula that was reinvigorated and temp-lated by Raiders Of The Lost Ark in 1981, The Golden Child misses all the required genre elements. Unconvincing girl, annoying reluctant-hero with weak quips in his armoury, forgettable villain {Charles Dance so English it's nauseating}, terrible color, and an irritating kid with unimpressive powers, the film only asks you to endure the tedium, not to enjoy or appreciate it as a fantasy picture. Yes, the CGI demon looks awful now, and yes the genre had far better pictures in the 80s, 90s and beyond, but really if you disagree with the generous rating of 5 here on this site then you may just be giving this genre too much credit, seriously. 3/10"|Negative
